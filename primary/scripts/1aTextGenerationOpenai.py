# Description #####
#this python script generates text based on a series of prompts using OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model
#It requires an OpenAI API key, which is not included on github.



#loading depencies #####
#if first time, run pip install openai

from config import OPENAI_API_KEY #loading API key. you will need your own.
import pandas as pd #for data wrangling
import os #for working with paths

import openai #for utilization of large language model
openai.api_key =  OPENAI_API_KEY #save API key

# see   https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create
