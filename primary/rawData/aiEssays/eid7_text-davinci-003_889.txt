I remember one time when I was patient was while I was working in my father’s shop. My dad had been in the middle of a big repair job when a customer pulled up to the back of our building with a broken lawnmower. He needed the repair done right away, and my dad had plenty of other tasks to do.

I offered to help him finish his repair job so that my dad could help the customer, and my dad agreed. I worked diligently, going over every single part of the job just as I had been taught. It was a tedious process, and it seemed to take forever. 

But I was patient, and I kept my cool. I took my time and finished the repair job as best I could until it was finished. When I told my dad it was finished, he inspected it carefully, and then said “you’ve done some mighty fine work here!”

The customer was very pleased and thanked us both for our help. Seeing his reaction made me feel happy and proud of myself and made me realize that patience truly is a virtue.
