I remember the day I first met my best friend. It was the first day of middle school and we had both just moved to the area. She seemed lost and I wanted to say hello, even though I was just as unfamiliar with the building as she was.

I walked up to her with a big smile and said, “Hi! My name is…” Before I could even finish introducing myself, she burst out laughing. I looked at her confused and then I couldn’t help but start laughing too. She asked me why I was laughing and I couldn’t explain it, so I just laughed even harder!

It was the most ridiculous thing, but at that moment we both knew that we were going to be great friends. From that day on, we laughed together often; on hard days, we would talk until our bellies hurt from laughing so hard. It was those moments of laughter that made our friendship strong and helped us connect with each other.

Laughter has always been at the heart of our friendship. Even now, when we don't see each other as much, we make sure to set aside time to just talk and laugh. Laughter is truly a powerful thing and I am so thankful to have found someone who can make me laugh no matter what.
