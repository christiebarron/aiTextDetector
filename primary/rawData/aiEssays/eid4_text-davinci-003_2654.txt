‘Winter Hibiscus’ by Minfong Ho is a coming-of-age story that speaks to the struggles of growing up in a world filled with expectations. The main character, Ah-Kim, is a young girl who faces immense pressure from her parents and classmates to do well on her exams and bring honor to her family. At the end of the story, Ah-Kim goes out into the snow to admire the hibiscus, a flower she loves. She knows that the flowers will eventually come back in the spring, and Ah-Kim’s internal monologue leaves the reader with the optimism that she will also have the opportunity to “take that test again” and prove to everyone what she is capable of. 

The passing of the winter to spring is an important motif in this story as it symbolizes Ah-Kim's journey from childhood to adulthood. After finding solace in the hibiscus, Ah-Kim is filled with inspiration to “keep going” and shows a newfound resolve to take on the challenge of the test with courage and confidence. The coming of the spring is a tangible sign that her hopes are not in vain and that the future holds more opportunity to try again, no matter how much pressure society imposes on her. This serves as an uplifting message that youth can rise above the obstacles of life and look towards the future with hope.

This message of hope resonates in the ending of the story when Ah-Kim realizes that even if her attempt at the test fails, it doesn’t signify the end of her journey
