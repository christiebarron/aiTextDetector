I recently had to go through my routine medical checkup and I was a bit anxious because I knew that I had to wait in a long line. I thought I was going to lose my patience, but I managed to stay calm and patient.

When I got to the reception, the person there told me that the doctor was running late and it would be an hour before I was seen. I was disappointed but tried to stay positive. I decided to take out some reading material to help the time pass, but even after 30 minutes there was still no sign of the doctor.

At that moment, I started to get frustrated, I thought it was a waste of time. But then I remembered how important it was for me to get a checkup and stay healthy. I decided to stay patient and finally, after about an hour, the doctor arrived.

I was relieved but also glad I had been so patient. The doctor was apologetic for the long wait, and I just smiled and thanked him for his apology. I'm glad I held my patienceâ€” it was difficult, but it paid off in the end.
