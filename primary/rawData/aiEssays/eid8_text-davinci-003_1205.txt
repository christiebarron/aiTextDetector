I fondly remember the day that I will never forget. It was the first time I had ever laughed with someone that I felt truly close to.

We had just been out for a meal, and afterwards we were walking back home in the early evening. We had been talking about some of the funniest moments of our week, and by this point I was choking back laughter.

We rounded a corner and stopped in our tracks at the sight of a cheerful little red roadster parked in the middle of the street. I'm not sure who made the first joke, but one of us commented that the car reminded them of Winnie The Pooh's car and that they would much rather drive that than their own car.

We started sniggering and quickly it escalated into full on laughter. I remember leaning against a wall, feeling the laughter arise deep within me and radiating around my whole body. It felt so liberating to let go and share a moment of pure joy.

Eventually we calmed down and started walking again, still giggling at our silliness. I felt so content in that moment, and it felt like I was truly connected to this person in a way I had never felt before. 

That was the moment I knew our relationship was truly something special.
