I was out for dinner with a good friend of mine who I had known since high school. We were reminiscing about the years we had spent together, talking about old inside jokes and stories from our past. As we were talking, we ended up cracking up and before we knew it, we were laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. Everyone around us had stopped and was looking at us, but we didn’t care. We had the kind of laughter that lasted for minutes and when the moment finally ended, I felt so close to my friend. It was like our shared laughter made a bridge between us and connected us in a way that wasn’t possible before. We have laughed together many times since then, but that first time will always stand out in my mind.
