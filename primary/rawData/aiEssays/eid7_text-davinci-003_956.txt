I was out at the grocery store doing my weekly shop when suddenly the line I was in stopped moving. I looked around and saw that a customer was giving the cashier a hard time because of the high cost of a product. The customer started to cause a scene, getting louder and louder and it didn't seem like it would end anytime soon.

At first, I was really frustrated and wanted to just leave the line and shop somewhere else. But then I remembered that being patient is a virtue, so I decided to stay. I started to think positive thoughts and deep breaths and concentrated on the tasks at hand. 

The customer finally calmed down and finished paying for the products before leaving the store. I was glad that I stuck around and was patient. This experience taught me to stay focused and not rush things. Being patient can help us to avoid unwanted confrontations with other people and can help us get more out of life.
