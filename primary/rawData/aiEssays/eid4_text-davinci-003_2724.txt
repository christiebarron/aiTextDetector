The poem “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho uses the metaphor of a hibiscus flower to represent the narrator’s struggles with a test in school. The poem’s ending reveals the hopeful outlook of the narrator, who resolves to try again in the future. 

The rhetorical question of “then I will take that test again?” suggests that the narrator is approaching the difficulty of the test with an optimistic outlook and confidence in their own capabilities. This is emphasized by the use of the words “when” and “again”, as the narrator is willing to keep trying until they can finally pass the test. 

The imagery of the “snows” melting, the “geese” returning and the “hibiscus” budding, connotes a sense of renewal, with the different elements of nature all coming together to start a new season. This ties in with the narrator’s own journey, as they are coming out of the unfavorable circumstances with a new sense of hope and determination. 

The poem emphasizes the importance of resilience in the face of difficulty. The narrator could have chosen to give up in the face of failure, but instead, they look to nature and use it as a source of rejuvenation and inspiration. Nature provides an assurance that everything is cyclical, and that seasons come and go. In a similar way, the narrator can rise above their difficulties and come out on top.
