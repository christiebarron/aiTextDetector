I was shopping at the grocery store, and I arrived at the checkout line after all of the other customers had been served. However, the cashier was having trouble with the register and had to call the manager to help them. I could see the other customers shuffling in line impatiently and growing frustrated. I chose to remain patient and understanding, despite the inconvenience. I tried to make conversation with the cashier, asking them how their day was going and expressing that it was no rush; I had plenty of time. Once their manager had finally arrived to help, they thanked me for being patient and understanding. I could tell that they felt more relaxed and less pressure to complete the cashiering quickly given my patient attitude.
