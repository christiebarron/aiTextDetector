I still remember the first time I ever had that deep, belly-shaking laughter with my friend Jack. We had just met a couple of weeks earlier, and we hadn't really hit it off right away. We had a lot of similarities, but we also had a lot of differences, too. 

We were walking around our neighborhood one day and hadn't said much of anything the entire time. All of a sudden, Jack started making fun of the way I was walking. I made a face and responded with, “What is wrong with the way I walk?” before breaking into a laugh. 

Jack laughed with me and soon we were both cracking up. We got some stares from passers-by as we continued on our way, but neither of us cared. We were just so glad to find something that we could both genuinely appreciate. 

We started talking about where we wanted to go for dinner, when I started to get a little overwhelmed. Laughing again, I confessed that I was having a hard time making a decision.

"I guess it’s good that the future of our relationship doesn't depend on whether or not we can agree on which restaurant to go to,” I said. 

Jack roared with laughter, and soon it was contagious. We just couldn't seem to stop laughing, and as we stumbled down the rest of the street, we knew that something special had just been born. 

Laughter is indeed the shortest distance between two people. That day, it was the force that brought us so close together.
