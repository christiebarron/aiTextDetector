It was my father's 50th birthday. Knowing how much he loves a good joke, my sibling and I decided to surprise him with a photo album of funny memories from our childhood. We filled it with pictures of us as kids, making funny faces and silly poses.

When my dad opened the album, we all started laughing. From goofy pictures of me dressed up like a pirate to embarrassing pics of my older brother performing his dance moves, there were endless laughs to be had. My dad was especially amused by one photo of my younger sister and I standing in matching outfits and painful poses.

We laughed so hard that tears began to stream down our faces. I couldn't remember the last time I had laughed that hard. We shared so many laughs and happy moments that day and I will never forget it. It was a perfect reminder that laughter truly is the best medicine and one of the best gifts that everyone can give.
