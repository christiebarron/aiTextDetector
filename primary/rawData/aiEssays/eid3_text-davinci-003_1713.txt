The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" is an important factor in how the cyclist experiences the journey. The rugged terrain of the mountain trails places the cyclist in an environment filled with natural obstacles. The rocky and steep path serves as a challenge to the cyclist who must have the strength and skills necessary to maneuver their way through the winding terrain.

The path is made up of sharp turns, intense inclines and descents, and varying terrain. This creates the necessity for the cyclist to use the correct technique in order to maintain their balance and make the most of the ride. The turns require the rider to apply the appropriate amounts of force in order to keep the bike balanced and in control. The uneven footing leads to sudden jerks which can throw off an inexperienced rider's balance and cause them to fall. 

The varying weather conditions also factor into how the cyclist experiences the ride. The cool temperatures at higher elevations may make the journey more difficult. The rider must layer their clothing and make sure their body stays warm and in control. The wet conditions make the terrain slick, adding further difficulty to the already difficult ride.
