I was standing in line at the grocery store and the person in front of me had an overflowing cart, which was causing the line to move so slowly. I was about to get impatient and frustrated, but I stopped myself and chose to be patient. I reminded myself that the person in front of me was just trying to get their grocery shopping done, and it wasnâ€™t their fault they had a full cart. So I smiled and watched the time pass. Before I knew it, the person was finished and I was up next. When I got to the register, the checker thanked me for being so patient and said that my kind attitude had made their job easier. I beamed, knowing that my patience had made a difference.
