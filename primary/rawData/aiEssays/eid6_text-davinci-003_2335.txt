The Empire State Building, completed in 1931, was intended to rival the majestic skyscrapers of New York City. One of the most unique features of the Empire State Building was its mooring mast, which was designed to dock dirigibles at the penthouse. However, the mooring mast posed numerous obstacles for the builders, as the construction and upkeep of the mooring mast was complicated and costly.

The first challenge faced by the builders was the structural limitations of the building itself. As the Empire State Building was composed of limestone and brick, the mooring mast had to be reinforced with steel and concrete to support the weight of the dirigibles. This made the cost of constructing the mast significantly higher than that of the other features of the building. Additionally, the Empire State Buildingâ€™s height also presented a challenge. The mooring mast was only 800 feet tall, which was not high enough to allow dirigibles to dock safely at the penthouse, as strong air drafts were common at such heights.

The safety of the dirigibles was also a major concern for the builders. As dirigibles were highly flammable and susceptible to the wind, a system had to be in place to ensure their safe arrival and departure from the building. To that end, a mooring bed, composed of cables and steel rods, was constructed to restrain the dirigibles when docking. The cables had to be extremely strong and capable of withstanding strong winds, as well as being able to hold the weight of an entire dirigible. 

Furthermore, the builders had
