 

In Joe Kurmaskiâ€™s short story "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist. Taking place in the mountains of western Washington, the scenery of the countryside is one of the most significant components of the setting. 

The hilly terrain of the area makes it difficult for the cyclist to ride. He has to struggle to climb every incline, making it a difficult and exhausting ride. The twisty roads also add to his struggle, as they take him in unpredictable turns that require maneuverability and concentration to navigate. Additionally, the dense forest creates a sense of isolation, making it seem like a risky and potentially dangerous journey, where the cyclist has the potential to get lost. 

The cyclist is further put at risk by the effects of the weather. It is raining, reducing visibility and making the roads wet and more slippery, as well as creating a cold and uncomfortable ride. The fog further limits the cyclist's vision, as he can barely make out the side of the road and is forced to take even slower turns. 

In summary, the setting of Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead" provides a challenging and intimidating environment
