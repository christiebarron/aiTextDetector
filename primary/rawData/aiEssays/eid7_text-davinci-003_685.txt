I remember one time when I was faced with an especially difficult situation and kept my composure. I was working at my part-time job on a particularly busy Saturday morning when I realized I had almost forgotten to do one of my duties. Realizing my mistake, I quietly began quickly to rectify it before anybody noticed. 

However, one of the other employees had noticed my misstep and she quickly sprang into action, pointing out my mistake in a rather stern manner. Knowing that this was going to be a problem, I took a deep breath and remained calm. I knew I had to express to her in a polite and respectful way that I had already started to solve the problem, and that no further action was necessary. 

My patience paid off. After I respectfully spoke up and calmly explained the situation, the other employee sheepishly backed down and apologized for the misunderstanding. It was an important lesson in the value of patience--despite being in a stressful situation, I managed to remain patient, understanding and respectful of the other person.
