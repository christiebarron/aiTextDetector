Dear Editor,

As a long-time resident of this community, I care greatly about our health and well-being, so I must express my opinion about the effects of computers on people.

I believe that, for many people, computers have become a crutch, replacing basic life skills like mental math and conversation. People are turning to computers for answers instead of relying on themselves to figure things out. This could lead to an overall lack of personal growth and responsibility.

Indeed, the overuse of computers can have a negative impact on our physical health. Studies have shown that sitting for long periods of time can lead to weight gain, insomnia, and poor posture, which can all have long-term effects on our health.

For these reasons, I urge readers to be mindful of their computer use and think of the potential negative impacts it can have on our health and well-being. Balance is essential when using technology, especially when it comes to using computers. Taking regular breaks, engaging in physical activity, and maintaining social relationships are all important steps to taking proper care of ourselves.

Thank you for listening to my opinion on the effects of computers on people.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
