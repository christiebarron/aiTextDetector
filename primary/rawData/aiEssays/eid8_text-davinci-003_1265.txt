I remember the first time my partner and I shared a genuine laugh together. We had been dating for a few weeks and were still getting to know each other. I had just met his parents and, as was the case with any new relationship, there was a lot of awkwardness. 

That is, until my partner's mom stepped in. She suggested playing one of his many board games, and before we knew it, the four of us were engaged in a lively game of 'The Game of Life'. We were quickly immersed in the game as everyone was determined to win. 

At one point, I had landed on a 'Lose and Pay' square, which meant I had to pay $2,000 to the bank. My partner chuckled and said, "Looks like you need to take out a loan!" in his playful tone. I laughed, not just at what he said but also at the way he said it, and before I knew it, we were all breaking up into a fit of laughter. From that moment on, I knew we shared a special bond. 

Laughter has always been a special part of our relationship. A spontaneous laugh binds us together, strengthens our connection, and brings us closer to one another. The intimate moments of understanding and levity shared between us only continues to increase the love we have for one another.
