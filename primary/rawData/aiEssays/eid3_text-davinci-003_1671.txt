In the story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays a major role in how the cyclist fares. The road the cyclist is traveling on is narrow and winding, the pavement having been damaged from weather, wrecks, and poor maintenance.

The cyclist has to be constantly aware of the uneven terrain and obstacles in order to remain safe.

The hilly landscape in the story also serves to make things more difficult for the cyclist. The ups and downs in the road make it harder to maintain momentum and speed, as hills require the cyclist to have a greater physical energy expenditure to keep going. The cyclist also has to navigate the winding road, which goes up and down along tree-lined slopes and takes a lot of energy to make it to the top of each hill. The cyclist is also in danger of unpredictably navigating blind turns, which could potentially lead to serious accidents.
