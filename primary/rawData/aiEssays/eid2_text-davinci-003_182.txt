Our local libraries face a difficult dilemma regarding censorship and the availability of materials. Libraries provide resources to communities, but they also have a responsibility to promote values of tolerance and respect. Is there a way to balance these competing priorities?

The issue of what books, music, movies, and magazines should be available in the library is a complex one. On one hand, access to books is a fundamental right and no one should dictate what people can or cannot read. But on the other hand, it is important to protect vulnerable members of the community who might be exposed to inappropriate material.

I believe the best approach is to allow for the widest variety of materials to be available, while also being mindful of what might be seen as offensive or inappropriate. Libraries should be transparent in labeling materials that are targeted toward certain readers, irrespective of age. Communications between librarians and library users should be open and respectful.

Rather than discriminating against a particular genre of materials, library administrators can strive to create an atmosphere of open conversation and support. Libraries should leverage the expertise of their staff and create events that discuss controversial topics and work to bridge divides. Screenings of movies, book clubs, and interactive debates can provide a healthy forum for discussion.

In the end, censorship of certain material can be a slippery slope and does not address the underlying issues that are at stake. Libraries should provide an inviting, safe space for all to explore, express, create and discover. By finding ways to responsibly incorporate controversial materials into the larger dialogue, library staff can become part of the solution and foster an inclusive community.
