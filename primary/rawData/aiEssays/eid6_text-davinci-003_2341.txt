The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the iconic skyscraper in the early days of the 20th century. One of the most pressing issues was locating an appropriate space at the top of the building to which the large vessels could be secured. The site of the Empire State Building was currently being excavated, and to accommodate the additional infrastructure needed for a mast and mooring cable would add significant cost and time to the project.

Additionally, the designers of the building had to develop a mast and cable system that would be able to withstand the weight of a large dirigible. Standard mooring cables and masts were not designed to do this and would not be able to withstand the constant wind pressure these large vessels generate. Innovative engineering and materials, such as steel instead of wood, had to be developed to ensure the mooring mast and cable could support a dirigible's weight.

The complexity of the process was largely due to the fact that the dirigibles of the period were the largest of airships, some even larger than the skyscraper itself. This made the process of connecting the mooring mast at the top of the building to the dirigible incredibly complex, as the mooring mast needed to be able to accommodate larger vessels that weighed upwards of many tons. 

Furthermore, even after the engineering and construction of a mooring mast and cable system that could handle such tremendous weight, there were still additional safety and security risks to consider. Dirigibles of the time were filled with hydrogen gas,
