The closing lines of Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” beautifully capture the theme of resilience, depicting a hopeful metaphor of blooming. At the end of the poem, the narrator tells us that they will take the test they failed again ‘when the snows melt and the geese return’. This signifies that the speaker has seen a cycle of death and renewal, and their new found strength can be demonstrated by repeating the test in the spring.

This idea of repeating the test and searching for hope is further strengthened by the metaphor of the hibiscus blooming. The speaker launches into an epic description of the blossom, showing its tenacity to survive despite the scourges of frost and black winds. This is a symbolic representation of their own strength which has been fortified by adversity. By learning from past experiences, the narrator can now persevere and leave fear and anxiety behind. 

The notion of seeing through darkness is also shown when the speaker mentions their failed test. It is a reminder of their difficulties and a symbol of a journey that needs to be overcome. But by accepting and learning from these negative occurrences, the speaker can conclusively move forward. This resilience is even hinted at in the final line of the poem, when they tell us that ‘this hibiscus is budding’. It is a representation of the fortitude they have conjured through difficult situations, demonstrating the capacity to survive and grow, even in the bleakest of winters. 

Inspired by the capabilities of nature, Ho conveys a message of endurance
