Mona Lisa Smile
Mona Lisa Smile is a 2003 American drama film directed by Mike Newell and written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal. The movie stars Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. The story is set in the 1950s at Wellesley College, an all-women's college in Massachusetts. The film explores the lives of four young women who are trying to find their place in a society that expects them to get married and become housewives.
The main character of the movie is Katherine Ann Watson (Julia Roberts), a free-spirited art history professor who comes to Wellesley College to teach. Katherine is not like any other teacher at Wellesley; she has her own way of teaching and encourages her students to think for themselves. She believes that women should have the same opportunities as men and should not be limited by societal expectations.
Katherine's arrival at Wellesley creates a stir among the students, especially among her art history class. Her unconventional teaching methods challenge the traditional views of the students, who are used to memorizing facts rather than thinking critically about art. Katherine introduces them to modern artists such as Jackson Pollock and encourages them to express their own opinions about art.
The four main characters of Mona Lisa Smile are Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst), Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles), Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin). Betty is a popular girl who comes from a wealthy family; she wants nothing more than to get married after college and become a housewife. Joan is an intelligent girl who dreams of becoming a lawyer but feels pressured by her family to get married instead. Giselle is a rebellious girl who enjoys partying and having fun; she does not take her studies seriously but has ambitions beyond getting married. Connie is a shy girl who is unsure of what she wants to do after college.
Katherine's teachings have a profound effect on the four girls, especially Betty. At first, Betty resents Katherine for challenging her beliefs and encouraging her to think for herself. However, as the movie progresses, Betty begins to see that there is more to life than getting married and having children. She starts to question her own beliefs and realizes that she wants more out of life than just being a housewife.
Joan also begins to question her own beliefs about marriage and career after taking Katherine's class. She realizes that she does not want to get married right away but wants to pursue a career in law instead. Giselle, who initially resists Katherine's teachings, eventually comes around and starts taking her studies seriously. Connie gains confidence in herself and decides to pursue a career in teaching.
The movie also explores issues such as racism and homosexuality. One of Katherine's students, a black woman named Pearl (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), faces discrimination from both the students and faculty at Wellesley because of her race. Another student, Nancy Abbey (Marcia Gay Harden), is revealed to be a lesbian; this causes controversy among the faculty members at Wellesley.
Mona Lisa Smile is an excellent portrayal of the struggles that women faced in the 1950s when it came to pursuing their dreams outside of marriage and motherhood. The film shows how societal expectations can limit women's opportunities and how difficult it was for them to break free from those expectations.
The performances by the cast are outstanding; Julia Roberts shines as Katherine Ann Watson, portraying her character with grace and intelligence. Kirsten Dunst gives an excellent performance as Betty Warren; she portrays her character's transformation from a traditionalist into someone who questions societal norms with ease.
The cinematography by Anastas N. Michos is beautiful; he captures the essence of the 1950s with his use of color and lighting. The soundtrack by Rachel Portman is also excellent; it captures the mood and tone of the movie perfectly.
In conclusion, Mona Lisa Smile is a must-watch for anyone interested in women's history and feminism. It is a powerful movie that shows how far we have come in terms of gender equality but also how much work still needs to be done. The film encourages us to question societal norms and to think critically about our own beliefs. It reminds us that we should not limit ourselves or others based on gender or any other factor. Mona Lisa Smile is a timeless classic that will continue to inspire generations to come.
