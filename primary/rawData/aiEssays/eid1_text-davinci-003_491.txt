Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on how computers are affecting our lives.

In the past few decades, computers have become a mainstay in our lives. We use them for work, entertainment, research, communication, and much more. There is no doubt that computers have had an immense positive effect on our lives, but they can also have a downside.

Excessive use of computers can have detrimental effects on our mental and physical health. For example, extended periods of staring at a computer screen can cause eyestrain and poor posture. Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to social isolation and depression, and can have detrimental effects on our relationships.

When used in moderation, however, computers can be a great tool to help us with our daily tasks. We can keep in touch with friends and family members, access a trove of valuable information, and even help us to stay focused and productive.

Therefore, it is important to remember that computers should be used in moderation in order to avoid harmful effects. We should also make sure that we find time to engage in physical activities, spend time with loved ones, and get enough rest so that our minds and bodies can stay healthy.

I am confident that if readers reflect on how computers are affecting their lives, they will come to the same conclusion: computers should be used wisely and with caution.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
