The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles in allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the top of the building. One of the biggest obstacles was the potential damage both to the airships and to the building itself. According to “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the walls of the Empire State Building had to be altered to bear the strain of an airship docking, and the mast was strengthened with steel and concrete.

The structure of the building itself posed another obstacle to dirigibles docking. The entire top portion of the building, known as the mooring mast, had to be specially designed to accommodate the airships. It had to be custom made and tested to ensure it was strong enough to support the weight of an airship as well as the sudden shifts in air pressure. Constructing the mooring mast was no small feat as it was extremely heavy and difficult to install in the blustery wind of the top of the building.

Additionally, figuring out the perfect way to moor the airship was yet another challenge the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome. Pierpont and his team determined the perfect combination of cables and ropes that would allow the airships to dock safely. This was a complex engineering challenge requiring the utmost precision. 

The designers of the Empire State Building also had to factor in the passage of law. The US Department of Commerce had to pass legislation to ensure that airships had the right to dock, and the airships also had to meet safety and insurance regulations.
