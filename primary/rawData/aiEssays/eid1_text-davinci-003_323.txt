As the world progresses, computer technology is becoming increasingly central to everyday life. Although computers have contributed a great deal to make life easier, their presence in our lives has not been without consequences. 

When it comes to computers, people often emphasize productivity, efficiency and convenience. But the impact of computer technology is rarely studied on an individual level. The heavy reliance on computer systems has had an impact on our physical health, mental wellbeing, and environmental sustainability. 

A major consequence of using computers is the increased risk of developing physical ailments such as eye strain, back and neck pain, repetitive stress injuries, and obesity. Research also suggests that using computers occasionally leads to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. In some cases, people become addicted to computers and the internet, resulting in significant changes in activities that impact their life-style.
