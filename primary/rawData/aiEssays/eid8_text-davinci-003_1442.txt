As I walked up to her door, I was filled with a mix of excitement and anxiety. I had been eyeing her from across the room for a few weeks, and finally mustered up the courage to ask her out. However, I wasn’t sure how she would respond.

I nervously knocked on her door, and she answered. Standing there in her doorway, I couldn’t resist flashing my best smile and giving her a confident “Hi.” She smiled back and before I could finish saying “How are you?”, she burst into laughter.

It was an honest, genuine laugh that had me joining in too. Our laughter stretched on for a few seconds before I managed to ask her, “Would you like to go for a walk?” She nodded and we stepped outside. 

We spent the rest of the evening talking and laughing. It was like we had known each other for years, when in fact it was our first meeting. 

I felt a connection with her in that moment and realized that it was our shared laughter that had helped bridge the gap between us. It felt like laughter had been the key to turning a potential awkward encounter into something special.
