I’ll never forget the day I shared a laugh with my best friend. We had been together for years and yet somehow it felt like the first time we had truly connected. 

It was late evening and both of us had just got out of school. I wasn’t in the best of moods and neither was she. We were bickering about something meaningless. That’s when she said something that made us burst out in uncontrollable laughter. It was a moment of joy, of absolute bliss. Outside of that moment, I had never felt more connected to her. 

We continued to laugh, giggling like little school girls until we couldn’t laugh anymore. When the moment ended, I truly felt like I had spent time with a best friend. There was something about that moment that made me realize how important laughter is in relationships. Even out of the smallest things, a simple laugh can bring the closest of people together. 

Since then we’ve cherished, chatted and shared countless laughs. It’s filled our friendship with an immense amount of joy and understanding. That one moment is a reminder to me of the value of laughter and how it can give any relationship a spark of energy. I’m grateful to have someone I can depend on to make me laugh. A best friend I can share memories, laughs and lots of love with.
