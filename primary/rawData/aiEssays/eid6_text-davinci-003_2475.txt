The construction of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge when the possibility of dirigible docking was introduced. These massive floating vessels could bring numerous commercial and recreational prospects to the city of New York, as well as allowing for flights to distant parts of the country. However, such an ambitious goal was no easy task to achieve. The obstacles that had to be overcome in order for the Empire State Building to accommodate dirigible docking were numerous.

First and foremost was the sheer size and weight of the dirigible. The typical vessel was hundreds of feet in length, weighed thousands of tons, and was capable of carrying hundreds of passengers. Such an undertaking required enormous engineering feats and a lifting device that could support the massive size and weight of the dirigible. To make matters even more complicated, these massive vessels had to be manoeuvred into a stable position close to the building. This challenge was met through the utilization of a newly designed mast, dubbed “The Mooring Mast”.

This structure was designed specifically to deal with the challenges of dirigible docking. To ensure that dirigibles were able to safely approach the building, a steel mast was built in the middle of the building’s roof that was 200 feet long and weighed in at over 300 tons. This mast featured several security systems, including multiple mooring lines that could be utilized to keep the vessel in proper position and a specifically designed “safety catch” system. The team of engineers also had to contend with the fact that the winds in New York and surrounding areas often became quite strong and gusty, making it extremely challenging to keep the
