I was shopping for my kids' school supplies and was having a hard time finding the right color and size of notebooks I needed. Unfortunately, the store did not have everything in stock. I could feel my patience starting to slip and I was beginning to get frustrated. 

Then, I noticed an elderly gentleman who was in line ahead of me and patiently waiting for the clerk to wrap up his purchase. He was so calm and relaxed, it reminded me that I just needed to take a deep breath and be patient. He also noticed I was struggling and offered me a friendly smile. 

The clerk eventually finished up with the elderly gentleman and then helped me find the supplies I needed. She apologized for not having everything in the store and I appreciated her attentiveness. In the end, I was able to find what I needed and I was reminded to stay patient when things donâ€™t go my way.
