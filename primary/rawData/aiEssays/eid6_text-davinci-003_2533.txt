The prospect of the Empire State Building having a mooring mast for dirigibles was enticing, but the process to make this a reality was wrought with obstacles. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains in her book The Mooring Mast, the path to allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building was a long and winding road. 

The first hurdle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the fact that the necessary construction techniques had yet to be developed. As Lüsted explains, the nature of the immense building’s architecture did not lend itself to the idea of having a mooring mast attached. The building’s metal skeleton, its narrow top, and its impressive height all provided additional challenges which required new design components and technology. 

Due to the lack of guidance in the area of construction technology, the builders of the Empire State Building recruited the help of the U.S. Navy. The Navy was able to send in a team of marine engineers to devise a viable plan for the mooring mast’s assembly. This partnership proved fruitful, as the engineers proposed the new concept of a ball-and-socket joint- a “telescoping joint”- which allowed the mast to rotate in any direction while showing no signs of strain.

In addition to the technical obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building had to worry about the legal issues which occurred with having this type of structural addition. Lüsted explains that the dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building had to have approval from both the FAA and the City of
