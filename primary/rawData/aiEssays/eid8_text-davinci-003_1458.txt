I was enjoying a day at the beach with my family when something unexpected happened.

I was playing a game of Frisbee with my cousin and trying my best to throw the Frisbee far enough for him to catch it. All of a sudden, he tripped over a rock and started laughing hysterically. I started laughing too, and soon enough the whole beach could see us rolling around on the ground, trying to catch a breath between laughs. 

The whole experience was incredibly amusing, and the most special part was that we were laughing together. Eventually, once the laughter died down, people from the beach had come closer to check if we were okay. We joked about the incident and thanked them for the concern but continued to laugh about the situation for the remainder of the day. 

I still remember the joy I felt that dayâ€”the joy that only laughter can bring. Moments like these are precious, and to this day I cherish the memories of my time spent with my cousin.
