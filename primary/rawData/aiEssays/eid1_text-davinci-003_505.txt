Dear Editor,

I am writing to you today to discuss the effects that computers have had on people and to persuade the readers to agree with me.

As technology advances, we have become more reliant on computers and the convenience they bring. In essence, they have taken away some of the skills, such as communication and problem solving, that are essential to adult life.

As a result, people have become too comfortable relying on computers and have begun to lose some of their fundamental abilities. This can not only inhibit creativity, but also reduce our ability to socialize and interact with others in the physical world.

At the same time, computers can be a helpful asset. They provide the capability to access and repackage large amounts of information quickly, potentially improving intellectual capabilities and task performances. Additionally, computers can connect people from all over the world, providing exposure to different cultures, norms, languages, and celebrations.

When used correctly, computers can be a powerful tool. We must remember the importance of taking time away from computers, though, to ensure we continue to maintain the skills necessary to be successful in the physical world.

I urge you, the reader, to agree with me. Take time away from your computer, making sure to get out and explore other aspects of life and the real world around us. We must remember that even though technology is convenient, it cannot replace the essential skills that humans need.

Sincerely,
