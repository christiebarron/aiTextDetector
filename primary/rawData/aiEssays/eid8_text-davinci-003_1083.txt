I was out at dinner with a group of friends. As the night wore on it seemed like no one was laughing, so I decided to try to turn the mood around by telling some silly jokes. At first, my friends just stared at me like I was crazy. I couldnâ€™t take the silence any longer, so I started cracking up in laughter. Misinterpreting my outburst as an indication that I found the jokes too funny, my friends finally joined in and began laughing along with me.

That simple act of laughter was like a spark that spread through the rest of the night. Everyone started to open up and the conversation began to flow, with laughter becoming much more frequent. As the evening wound down, it was clear that laughter had reconnected us all and brought us even closer together. That night was a great reminder that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
