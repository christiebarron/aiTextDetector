The challenge of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was more formidable than most people realize. From conception to completion, the builders faced a number of obstacles that had to be overcome before any safe and practical mooring scheme could be implemented. 

The main obstacle faced by the builders was the height of the building. At 1,250 feet, the tallest structure of its kind in the world, the building was much higher than any previous mooring mast had ever been constructed in order to accommodate a dirigible. The task of designing and constructing a new mooring mast at such a height presented a unique challenge. 

The challenges faced by the builders went beyond the construction of the mast. Due to the enormous size and weight of the dirigibles, a large platform capable of supporting the weight of the airship needed to be constructed atop the building. Furthermore, winds and turbulence at the height of the building posed additional hazards that could make docking a dirigible incredibly dangerous. To overcome these issues, revised laws and regulations had to be established to ensure the safe and orderly operation of the dirigible dock. 

The builders would also need to embrace a creative bent to ensure that the docking process would be successful. To accomplish this, they created a sophisticated winch system that was capable of lowering a secure steel mooring hook to the rooftop. Once the hook was in place, the dirigible could dock with the building and be securely fastened. This allowed dirigibles to dock with the Empire State Building safely and efficiently.
