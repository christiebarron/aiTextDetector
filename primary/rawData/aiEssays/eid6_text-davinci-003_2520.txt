The Empire State Building has gone down in history as a monument to human ambition and ingenuity. Construction began in 1930 and it as completed a mere 15 months later, making it the fastest skyscraper ever built. But what is lesser known about this iconic skyscraper is that it was built with a revolutionary purpose in mind – to serve as a landing dock for dirigibles.

Sadly, it was this very purpose that the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately failed to fulfill. There were numerous barriers that hindered the project from ever coming to fruition. The first—and most obvious—hindrance was the sheer size of the building. The Empire State Building is an impressive 102 stories, with the docking mast at a whopping 1,472 feet tall. Aside from the sheer size of the building, the mast itself posed an engineering challenge. The mast was built with girders and trusses that were intended to be light, but the structure had to be strong and durable enough to withstand the weight of mooring dirigibles.

Another challenge that the builders faced were the risks associated with airship navigation. Dirigibles were still relatively new technology and thus had difficulties in accurately gauging elevation and speed. This created a dangerous risk for the docking mast as a wrong maneuver could have caused the dirigible to crash into the building and result in catastrophe. 

One final challenge that the Empire State Building builders faced was the changing priorities of the public. In 1930, the idea of being able to fly from one major city to another in a few hours was still a novelty. By the time the structure was finished
