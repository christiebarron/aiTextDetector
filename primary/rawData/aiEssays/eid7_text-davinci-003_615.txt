I hadn't expected the flight home to be so uncomfortable, with the person next to me in the middle seat taking advantage of most of my area as well as theirs. Surprisingly, I was surprisingly patient about it as a matter of principle. 
I didn't want to argue or start a unnecessary discussion about personal space for the couple of hours that we had together. I just kept reminding myself, it's ok, this will be over soon enough. 
Rather than making a scene, I just shifted my body the best that I could, getting the occasional elbow in the side, to find a more comfortable position. I figured that the less I did, the better off both of us would be in the long run. 

When we finally landed, I was relieved that I had been able to stay calm and remain patient. My patience had paid off and I realized that it was better to be the bigger person and let it go. In the end, patience was the greatest reward.
