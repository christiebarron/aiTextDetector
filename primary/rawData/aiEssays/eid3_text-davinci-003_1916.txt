In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting and its characteristics have a major influence on how the cyclist views himself and his own efforts. The setting of a mountainous road with no destination in sight provides a backdrop to the cyclist’s journey and goals.

The imagery of a long and winding mountain road tells us that the rider will have to put in a significant effort to get to his destination. The mountains, which can be seen in the distance, create a sense of anticipation and challenge for the cyclist. This can be seen in the line “A long way from the start and no end in sight” which implies that the cyclist will have to make it to the finish line no matter how difficult the road is. The imagery of the “rough” and “disturbed” earth reinforces the idea of a challenging journey and suggests that there will be obstacles and quagmires along the way.

The presence of the moon and stars, while not mentioned directly, suggest that the journey will take place at night, making the way even more difficult and challenging. The moonlight signifies hope and faith that the cyclist will be able to reach his destination
