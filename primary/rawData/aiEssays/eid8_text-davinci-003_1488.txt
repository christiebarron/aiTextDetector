 

I still remember the first time my now fiance and I laughed together. We had been on a couple of dates, but both felt too shy to risk truly opening up to one another. 

The moment we shared laughter broke through our walls. It happened on a sunny day. We were in a park, talking while lounging in the grass. Our conversation took a silly turn and we started being silly together. All of a sudden, it felt like the world morphed into a stand-still and there was only us, two people spinning in mad mirth. 

We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes teared up. As I looked into his eyes, I knew our relationship would grow even further. We both knew that this moment was special and our connection strengthened. Its warmth remains with me to this day. 

That experience of shared laughter was the beginning of my relationship with my fiance. That day, we learned about the power of laughter, and it has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our relationship.
