The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock due to its immense size and complex logistics. The primary issue to be surmounted was the construction of the “mooring mast” on top of the building—an innovative engineering project that caused much debate and was only undertaken after much consideration and planning. 

The first difficulty that arose when constructing the mooring mast was the sheer size of the Empire State Building, as it was much taller than most buildings of its time. Thus, the design had to be much sturdier and secure than any mooring mast that had been built before. Furthermore, the mast had to be able to support the weight of the moored dirigible, as well as withstand the impact of the winds that surrounded it at its altitude. 

In addition to the mechanical difficulties of constructing the mast, there were also logistical issues. A major problem involved providing some form of power and lighting to the mooring mast itself. As the mast was placed so high up on the building, it would have to be powered directly from the Empire State Building. This posed a considerable engineering challenge, as the power supply had to be able to survive the full range of temperatures, winds and other weather conditions at the mast’s altitude. 

Finally, the mooring mast had to meet the stringent guidelines created by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which mandated the placement and the exact specifications of the mast. These requirements included using the strongest materials available, such as steel girders and a solid concrete foundation, as
