The poem “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho ends with the speaker longing to take another test, placed in the context of a change of season. This ending reflects the speaker’s sincere yearning to prove themselves and become someone of value, by taking this test and potentially doing better than they did before.

This line paints an image of hopefulness. The coldness of the winter suggests that things have stagnated and the speaker has found themselves in an emotionally daunting situation. They have become accustomed to their current life and lack the motivation to strive for more. The speaker, however, refuses to accept their current situation and longs for a change.

The idea of a change of season signifies a chance for a fresh start. When the geese return, and the snows melt, the spring symbolizes a period of growth and rejuvenation. The string of verbs “budding,” “taking,” and “again” emphasize the speaker’s eagerness for a second chance. The combination of imagery and word choice cleverly conveys the promise of a brighter future, given the right conditions.

The use of symbolism ties in with the mood of the poem. Even when the protagonist is feeling defeated, they remain hopeful. Just like the flowers that bloom in the spring, they are determined to try again and regain their strength. The winter hibiscus, which remains in bloom throughout the winter, serves as a reminder that even when nothing is certain, there is always hope in the future.
