During the creation of the Empire State Building, a major engineering challenge was to provide a facility for docking dirigibles, or large airships. This was of particular importance, as the Empire State Building was seen as a gateway to the airways and air traffic was increasing in the early 20th century. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to make this goal a reality.

The first obstacle that presented itself was the need for additional infrastructure. To accommodate docking, a mooring mast needed to be dedicated to the Empire State Building. The mast needed to be a particular shape and height in order to properly secure the dirigible and protect it from hazardous winds. A new infrastructure such as this would come with a hefty price tag, but it was ultimately deemed a necessary expense.

The second obstacle the builders faced was the oversight of the entire process. Dirigibles were fragile vessels and the landings would need to be done carefully to ensure the ships and their passengers were safe. To that end, the builders hired a Navy Commander who was a specialist in mooring and dirigibles. He would supervise the construction of the mooring mast and ensure that all Federal Aviation Regulations were met.

The third obstacle was the process of testing the rigors of the mast and the mooring ropes. Structural engineers conducted tests and simulations to ensure that the mast and the ropes could sustain the forces of a dirigible arriving and departing. After successful testing, the construction of the mast began.
