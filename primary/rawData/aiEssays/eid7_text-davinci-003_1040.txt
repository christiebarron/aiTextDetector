As a child, my grandmother would often tell the story of my grandfather's patience. He had worked in a factory most of his life, and in his mid-fifties, he began to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. He knew that it was the result of years of repetitively using his hands as a machinist, but he continued to work so that his family was taken care of. 

Every morning he would get up early, and make his way to the bus stop to brave a 3-hour commute just to get to work. During the ride, he could feel the pain progressing in his hands, yet he never complained. He tried to smile or joke around with his fellow passengers despite the pain.

One day, the bus broke down, leaving my grandfather stranded in the middle of nowhere. After two hours, no other buses had shown up, and he was getting increasingly anxious about being late for work. 

It wasn't until hours later that another bus arrived, and when everyone boarded, my grandfather was still smiling. He had been patient and trusting that he would get to his destination, despite the tedious journey.

I will always remember this story of my grandfather's patience. It showed me that no matter what the circumstances, kindness and understanding can carry you a long way.
