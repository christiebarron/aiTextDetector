I recently had a friend come to visit from out of town who was an avid golfer. We had planned to spend our weekend golfing but the weather had other plans. When we arrived at the course in the morning, it was pouring rain and the greens were flooded. While I wanted to spend our weekend having fun, I also wanted to stay true to our plans and golf. I told my friend that we should wait a bit and see if it clears up. Even though I knew that there was a good chance that the rain would continue, I remained patient and hopeful that it would subside.

We stayed at the course for several hours, periodically checking back to see if the rain had ceased and the course had dried. Though I could sense my friend's frustration, as he had come a long distance to play golf with me, he remained patient and supportive. After about five hours, the rain finally stopped and we were able to start playing. We had a great time golfing in the sunshine and I was really happy that I had been patient and wait for the rain to clear up.
