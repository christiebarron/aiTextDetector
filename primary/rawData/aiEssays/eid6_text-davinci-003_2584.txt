The construction of the Empire State Building, an architectural marvel of the early twentieth century, was not without its obstacles. One major problem faced by the builders was the task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. At the time, it was thought that this technological advancement would be the future of air transportation, and the Empire State Building would be a prime example of embracing the new innovation.

The first challenge faced when docking dirigibles was coming to agreement on the design, construction, and installation of the “mooring mast,” which was essentially a pen or scaffold located at the top of the building to which dirigibles could attach themselves to securely dock. This was an ambitious project in and of itself as the mooring mast had to be securely implemented without compromising the building’s structural soundness. One particular concern was ensuring the stability of the mast so that it would be able to withstand even the strongest winds.

Another obstacle encountered was the task of monitoring the heavy air traffic that would head to the top of the building when a dirigible was ready to dock. To facilitate landings, a code of signals had to be created so that cars, pedestrians, and people on the street below would know when to expect a dirigible and how to respond. This was especially important due to the narrow landing strip that the dirigible had to maneuver around.

Another challenge was just the sheer size and mass of the dirigibles, which could weigh up to 75 tons and be as long as almost 800 feet. To enable the building to support the weight of
