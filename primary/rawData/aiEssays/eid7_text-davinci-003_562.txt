I was recently in a very stressful situation with a challenging work task. I had to work out the details of a project that was due in only a few days. I was getting increasingly anxious and scared that I wouldn't be able to do it right. I was really struggling to find the right solution so I decided to take a moment to breathe and remain calm. 

I sitting there for a few moments, deep in thought and trying to focus. And as I kept at it, and stayed patient, the answers started to come to me. I started to see the problem from more angles and saw more clearly the possible solutions. I felt a huge weight lifted from my shoulders and continued, with more confidence, to work on the project. 

In the end, I was able to finish the project on time. This was only possible because I was willing to stay patient and take a moment to figure things out. And it showed me the importance of staying patient and having faith in myself and my abilities.
