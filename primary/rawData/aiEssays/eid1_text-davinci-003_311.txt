Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people. I believe that the influence of computers on our lives is both positive and negative. On the one hand, technology has drastically changed the way we communicate, receive news, and conduct business. We are now able to communicate with people throughout the world with the click of a button, access important news stories almost immediately, and even shop online. These advancements make life easier in many aspects, and it is clear that computers have opened up opportunities that were not available in the past.

On the other hand, I fear that we are increasingly relying on our computers for basic activities that used to be done with a pencil, pen, book, or piece of paper. Our lives have become digitized and virtualized, often at the cost of personal socialization and real-world interactions. We are missing out on face-to-face conversations, physical books, and real-life experiences. We need to be careful to prevent computers from taking over our lives and becoming a crutch for us to rely on for every task or decision.

In conclusion, I believe that technology has revolutionized many aspects of our lives, yet it is important to recognize the need for balance in order to maintain our basic human connections. Computers should not be used to replace meaningful real-world interactions.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
