I can scarcely remember a time before laughter in our relationship. When my partner and I first met, two very different worlds had come together. We were an unlikely match, but as we found out more about each other, we discovered how much we had in common. In the months that followed, we shared more and more of our lives with one another. 

Laughter quickly became an integral part of our relationship. Whether it was through jokes, movies, or stories, we found ourselves laughing together more and more. It was the laughter that slowly pulled us together and built a strong connection between us. 

One evening, we went to a concert together. There was one particular song that was performed that evening that struck a chord with both of us. We couldn't help but laugh uncontrollably when it was played, both of us feeling a resonance in the same moment. We embraced each other after that song finished, knowing we had just shared something special.

It's moments like that which have kept us together over the years. Our laughter has held us through the hard times, and also brought joy and lightness to our lives. We don't always agree, but laughter is always at the heart of our relationship.
