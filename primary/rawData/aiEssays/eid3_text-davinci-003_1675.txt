The features of the setting in 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski play an important role in how the cyclist interacts with their environment. The cyclist is travelling through a rural setting, which is immediately evident from the initial stanza that describes the presence of mountains, creeks and barns. All of these features create a challenging terrain for the cyclist, which is made more difficult by the winding roads and lack of shoulder space. This significantly increases the difficulty for the cyclist, pushing them to their limits and requiring them to be more cautious and mindful of their environment. 

The presence of wildlife also plays an important role in impacting the cyclist. The speaker mentions the presence of deer, suggesting that the cyclist must be careful not to disturb their natural habitat whilst travelling. The wildlife also adds to the unpredictable nature of the environment. The cyclist must be mindful of the sudden presence of wild animals, as this may create hazardous conditions, as well as create a disruption to their journey. 

The final detail that is mentioned in the poem is the presence of storms. This detail is not explicitly mentioned by the author, however it is implied by the mention of thunder. Storms can pose a huge risk to any cyclist,
