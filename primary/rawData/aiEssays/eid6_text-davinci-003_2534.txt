The building of the Empire State Building faced immense obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. The existing plans for the building, which had already begun by 1929, did not include a mooring mast for dirigibles. Dirigibles of that time were the size of airships, making it difficult for the builders to decide where to place the mast and how long it should be. Securing the mooring mast to the Empire State Building structure also presented an immense problem as the building itself was already well advanced in its construction.

The mooring mast was an invention of the powerful and influential businessman David Sarnoff, who dreamed of cross-country dirigible travel. He approached the builders of the Empire State Building, hoping to convince them to install his unique mast in the building so that dirigibles could dock safely. However, the New York building authorities were hesitant to approve Sarnoff’s request, as installing a mooring mast would involve significant cost and risk. While Sarnoff made a strong case for the safety of its passengers, the building's engineers were also worried about potential problems arising from the wind shear that would be created when a dirigible pulled away from the mast.

In the end, Sarnoff and the building’s engineers were able to design a mooring mast that was secure and safe enough to be built into the structure of the Empire State Building. However, the process was long and expensive, costing an additional $500,000 to construct. The mast had to be enclosed in a steel box to reduce wind shear
