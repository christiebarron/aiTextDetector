 

The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski is the New Mexico desert, and its features directly shape the cyclist's journey. This environment is very different than what most cyclists in the US are used to. The air is hot and dry, the sun shines brightly, and the absence of trees and other vegetation can make it feel hot, isolated, and vulnerable. The cyclist's extreme fatigue and thirst amplify the effects of the setting. The wind can make it difficult for the cyclist to make any kind of forward progress as it causes them to bow and creak, reducing their forward momentum. The sand on the road can also reduce the cyclist's traction, which can cause additional fatigue and struggle. The lack of shade and the presence of intense light both add an element of danger to the cyclist's journey, as they can cause sunburns, dehydration, and other medical issues.

The environment of the desert is harsh and can easily prove fatal to those who don't take the proper precautions. While cycling in the New Mexico desert poses more challenges and dangers than usual, it also presents an incredibly enriching experience. The cyclist is able to take in the stark beauty of the desert, observe the wildlife and vegetation
