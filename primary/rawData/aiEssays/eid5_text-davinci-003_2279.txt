Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is an incredibly powerful, honest and heart-wrenching story of race, family, love and home.

The memoir is centered around the theme of family and, while the narrative is structured with Rodriguez’s personal experiences, the mood it creates is one of community and acceptance. Rodriguez shares his own story of loss, family secrets, and cultural identity, and weaves in stories of his relatives and wider community to create a sense of unity and comfort throughout the book. Rodriguez explores his identity, his beloved Cuba and deeply woven family ties. Memories and experiences of childhood, home and traditional culture come alive on the page, creating an atmosphere of nostalgia and warmth.

At the same time, however, juxtaposed with the comfort of his childhood home, Rodriguez’s story also reflects the pain and difficulty of leaving the familial home, transitioning to a new and unfamiliar environment, and within this context, understanding his cultural identity and navigating his way in this new life. We are taken through the struggle of growing up and learning what home is, the joys and the betrayals of family and ultimately the love that lies at the core of those relationships. 

The mood created in the memoir is one of sincerity, comfort and love, that despite the struggles and pain, these connections are formed and shaped, and a home can be found in more places than one. Through Rodriguez’s writing, a powerful narrative comes to life, building a strong sense of community and resilience.
