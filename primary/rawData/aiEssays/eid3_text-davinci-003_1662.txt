In Joe Kurmaski's story, 'Rough Road Ahead', the cyclist encounters a tough set of circumstances as they travel through a desolate road. The setting is considered an integral feature of the cyclist's struggles; it is probably one of the main challenges they must endeavor throughout their journey. 

The first feature that adds to the cyclist's hardships is the terrain. The road consists of a long stretch without rest, an incline that gradually increases, and a crystal clear air that hints of danger ahead. The cyclist's goal is to survive the ride while perfecting their skills, and the relentlessly demanding terrain requires them to remain fully agile and physically prepared. 

The next feature of the setting is the environment around the cyclist. It's a remote route with no cars, people, or signs of civilization for miles; in fact, the cyclist's only source of comfort is a hopeful blue sky. Being distant from familiar landmarks and humans, the cyclist must bravely push forward in a complete state of isolation. 

Lastly, the weather becomes one of the cyclist's strenuous adversaries. As the cyclist moves further along the stretch, the atmosphere shifts from a cheerful day of sunshine to an uneasy, thunderous night.
