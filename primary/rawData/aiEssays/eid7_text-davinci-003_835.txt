One time, I was traveling around Europe and it was the first time I'd traveled alone. I was excited but at the same time a little nervous. 

During my trip, I arrived at the railway station in Paris after a long journey to discover that I had missed my connection and there was no other train for at least three hours. I was frustrated, but I remained calm and understanding of the situation. I had the option to panic and kick up a fuss, or stay patient and try to make the best of the situation. 

So, I decided to wait. I pulled out my laptop and enjoyed a cappuccino at the café near the station. The staff at the café were doing their best to make my visit as pleasant as possible and I chatted to some of the local people in the café.

When the train arrived, I was grateful to be on my way. I was thankful for the experience and reminded that patience is key when it comes to traveling. No matter how difficult the situation, staying calm and patient can make all the difference.
