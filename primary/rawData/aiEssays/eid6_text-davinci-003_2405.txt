The Empire State Building was the world’s tallest building when it was completed in 1931, and one of its most remarkable attractions was the installation of a mooring mast atop the 102nd floor, meant to provide a safe touchdown zone for dirigibles. But bringing this ambitious idea to fruition was not without its challenges and obstacles, as evidenced in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast.”

The most obvious and important obstacle to overcome was the task of making the building sturdy and strong enough to withstand the weight and force of a large airship. In order to do this, the architects used reinforced steel and concrete and employed innovative construction techniques to ensure that the building’s frame could support the extra burden and pressure of a moored craft. Engineering problems had to be overcome, and the entire mooring mast and related structure had to be designed in a way that would prevent airship passengers from being blasted with exhaust fumes as rooted engines roared at the docking tower’s base.

But just as important as the challenge of building a stable mooring mast was the issue of giving pilots a clear way to maneuver their ships. The relatively small amount of space for the mooring equipment provided a tricky navigation puzzle for pilots, and it was determined that pulsing red and green lights would be installed to give pilots visual cues to guide them.

While the original plan was to use the mooring mast to facilitate regular airship trips to the New York City area, this goal was never fully realized due to a number of different events, including
