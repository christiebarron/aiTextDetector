Iâ€™ll never forget the first time my boyfriend and I laughed together. We'd been talking on the phone every day for weeks and we finally got to meet in person. We were both a little shy and awkward, so conversation was a little sparse, but then I said something silly by accident and all of a sudden, we were both erupting in laughter. It felt like a wall had suddenly come down between us, and I knew then that I was completely at ease with him. We've been together for several years now, and I still remember that moment as one of the most special of our relationship. We don't need words all the time now, because we have the perfect shorthand of shared laughter. We just need to look at each other and we can't help but start giggling. It doesn't matter what we're doing, we always find something to laugh about together. It's been a beautiful connection that still carries us through difficult moments and makes even the simplest moments special.
