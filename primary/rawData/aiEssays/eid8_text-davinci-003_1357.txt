I remember the first time I met my best friend. We were both shy, so the conversation didn’t really flow. We just kind of looked at each other and said nothing. After a moment, I spotted a stray leaf on the ground and without thinking, I kicked it towards her. She was so shocked that she couldn’t help but laugh – and for me, that was all I needed. We started talking and I could see that we had so much in common, and I can safely say that she’s the best friend I’ve ever had. Whenever there’s a moment of awkward silence, I know that I can always count on her to laugh, and it’s just an amazing feeling that no one else can ever replace.
