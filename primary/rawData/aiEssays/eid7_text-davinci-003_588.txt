I once had a job working in an office that was very stressful. One of my co-workers in particular had a tendency to make things much harder for the rest of us. They would leave tasks half finished, ignore requests for help and generally be quite uncooperative. Despite the challenges this person posed, I was determined to remain patient. 

I felt my temper rise many times during this experience, but I kept it in check. I calmly reassigned tasks that my co-worker had neglected, and continually asked them if they needed help with anything. I figured that if I was patient and understanding, eventually things would improve.

And I was right. After a few months, my co-worker started to become more helpful and reliable. They even volunteered to help out with tasks I hadn't assigned them. Slowly but surely, my patience paid off, and it made my job much easier in the long run.
