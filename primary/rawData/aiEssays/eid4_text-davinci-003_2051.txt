Throughout the poem, Ho paints a vivid picture of the winter’s effects on the hibiscus, which serves to represent the narrator's own situation. The winter has brought adverse conditions such as snow, cold temperatures, and a long sleep. When the narrator looks at the hibiscus, she sees how it has been subjected to the same obstacles she has been facing—a feeling that she is in a state of “long hibernation.”

However, the poem does not end with a sense of despair. Instead, the narrator finds hope in the prospect of seeing the return of spring. When the snow melts and the geese return, the hibiscus starts to bud, representing a new start for both the flower and the narrator. It is this hope that drives the narrator to take the test again. It is as if she is saying, “if the hibiscus can make it through the winter and come back, then I can too.”

By ending with a note of hope and optimism, Ho suggests that with the end of winter, growth is possible. Even in the toughest circumstances, people can find strength to keep going and make a better future for themselves. The poem ends with the expectation of a fresh start and new opportunities to come, a sentiment that
