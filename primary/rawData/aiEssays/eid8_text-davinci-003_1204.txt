The other day, my best friend and I were walking up to a cafe. We were both in good spirits and looking forward to catching up over coffee when suddenly, a huge clap of thunder rolled over us. I shrieked with surprise and my friend started laughing. We started over again and before we even knew it, both of us were laughing hysterically on the sidewalk. 

We were both in such a fit of giggles that people started looking at us and since it was such an ugly and drizzly day, it was quite the sight. After a few minutes of laughing, I finally composed myself and we made our way inside the cafe. We ordered our coffee, still smiling and chuckling, feeling better than ever to have just shared such a bit of laughter together.
