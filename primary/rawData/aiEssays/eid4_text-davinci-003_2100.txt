Minfong Ho’s poem ‘Winter Hibiscus’ is a story of resilience in the face of difficulty. In the poem, a young girl is struggling to pass a test. When the snow falls, she uses the imagery of a winter hibiscus to inspire her to keep trying, despite the difficulty. The poem ends with the young girl determined to take the test again when the snow melts and the geese have returned. 

The phrase ‘When they come back in the spring’ speaks to the idea of renewal and hope. In the poem, the winter hibiscus is bravely clinging to a bush, ‘bowing its head in the snow/ as if trying to remember its color’. The idea that even in the face of difficulty, there is still hope is a powerful message. The poet conveys that despite the challenge of a hard exam, the young girl can remain hopeful and determined. 

The imagery in the poem speaks volumes - the resilient hibiscus, the cold winter, the geese returning - all of these details contribute to a powerful message of perseverance. The hibiscus is a symbol of hope, and its return in the springtime reflects the idea that even in the darkest days, something is always blooming. It’s this idea of hope and resilience which the young girl takes with her when she resolves to take the test again in the springtime. 

The ending of ‘Winter Hibiscus’ is inspiring and empowering. Through the poem, Minfong Ho conve
