Second, censorship works against the very purpose of a public library, which is to provide information and resources to the public. Every individual should be entitled to develop their own opinion, form their own beliefs and be exposed to varying opinions and values. The library, as a place of learning, has an obligation to provide unrestricted opportunities to explore and be informed, which censorship denies.
