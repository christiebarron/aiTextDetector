Dear Editor,

As a citizen of our town, I am writing to express my opinion about the effect computers have on people.

The truth is, computers have had a tremendous impact on our lives. From making our workdays more efficient to connecting us with the world, computers have opened up amazing possibilities for us. It’s safe to say that computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, work and spend our leisure time.

However, this revolution has a dark side. While computers have made our lives easier and more convenient, they have also caused a disconnect between us and the people in our lives. We are often so focused on our devices that we forget to actually interact with the people around us. Even worse, many of us have become addicted to our devices, leading to a less healthy lifestyle.

That’s why I’m urging the members of our community to reconsider their relationship with computers. Remember to take breaks and limit your scrolling and streaming to moderate amounts. Spend more quality time with family, friends and yourself. Only then can we enjoy the fruits of the digital age without sacrificing our physical, mental and social health.

I believe that, with conscious effort, we can enjoy the modern conveniences of computers while taking part in meaningful conversations, relationships, and activities with those in our community.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
