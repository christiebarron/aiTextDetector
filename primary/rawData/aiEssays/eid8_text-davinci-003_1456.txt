I had a really amazing moment with my best friend the other day. We were coming back from the mall and decided to stop off at one of our favourite cafes. The cafe was full, but miraculously, two seats opened up at the same time. I motioned for her to sit down and we both did. 

We started chatting away and suddenly we got the feeling that the whole cafe had gone quiet. We looked around and saw that everybody was staring at us, grinning. One of the staff members had put on music and was dancing around the cafe, making funny faces at us. We laughed until our sides ached, and we couldn't help but join in, doing dance moves of our own.

Eventually, our food arrived and the entertainment ended. But the mood had lightened and the cafe was buzzing with laughter. Everyone was smiling, even the staff members. I couldn't help but think that in that moment, even the walls had been touched by our shared laughter.
