I remember the first time I laughed with my best friend. I was so nervous and scared of the thought of making friends in my new town. Yet, here I was trying to make friends with a group of kids who already knew each other for years.

As I awkwardly tried joining in their conversation, my best friend caught me off guard. She said something so random and funny that I couldn’t help bursting with laughter.

The whole room was filled with different sounds, but the one that really stood out was mine. My laughter was contagious, and soon everyone joined in. We were all talking and laughing with one another, and I felt like I was finally connecting with everyone.

We talked and laughed for what felt like hours until the bell rang and we all had to go separate ways. Before I left, she looked at me and said, “you’re going to fit in perfectly here”.

From then on, I remember my best friend and I sharing so much laughter - whether we were in and out of class, or at our sleepovers where we had endless talks about life.

Years later, our friendship has never been this closer and all I can credit is laughter - that one moment where I had my first real laugh with my best friend.
