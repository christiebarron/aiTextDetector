Censorship in libraries should not be tolerated. Libraries are places of learning and exploration, and by limiting the materials that patrons can access, libraries risk stifling growth and creativity. 

Books are among the most expressive forms of art, and censorship suffocates its potential. Writers strive to invoke emotion, call for justice, and impart wisdom through the written word. To restrict authors from conveying their thoughts in a particular way is to infringe upon the right to free speech. Furthermore, if certain books are deemed unsuitable and removed from library shelves, some readers may be deprived of the opportunity to learn about a particular subject as complete information is no longer available. 

We should also value the freedom of choice. Although librarians are responsible for selecting appropriate materials, patrons should be given the freedom to decide what they access. If libraries only stock works that can be deemed as “acceptable”, then patrons may miss out on discovering new perspectives and valuable life lessons that may differ from the accepted standards.

We should not restrict the public knowledge and open access to information in favour of curating a display of only pre-approved materials. Librarians can guide patrons to access appropriate materials without taking away their freedom of choice. Furthermore, by removing controversial materials from library shelves, libraries are giving in to the strategy of those who would oppress freedom of expression and thought. 

The elimination of censorship in libraries will allow books to become vehicles of enlightenment and discussion on controversial topics, while respecting the right to free speech. Libraries should remain places of learning and freedom of choice.
