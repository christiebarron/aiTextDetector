As I approached the end of my shift at the local supermarket, I still hadn’t sold any of the special deal items that were set up at the entrance. I was frustrated since I had been assigned to this task as part of my job, but I forced myself to remain patient.

The customers who entered the store rarely stopped to look at the items, and my shift was almost over, leaving me with unused stock. As I went to start packing up, an elderly customer approached and asked me some questions. I take my job seriously, and I wanted to ensure that this customer had the best experience, however long it might take. Despite the minutes ticking away, I answered her questions, remaining courteous and patient.

Once she was happy, she began putting products she wanted into her basket. When she came to the till, I discovered she was paying in exact change. I didn’t rush her and took the time to patiently count out all the change.

My patience was rewarded with a big smile and thank you when the transaction was complete. As I watched her walk out of the store, I felt good that I had taken the time to do the job correctly and with care. My day had been made, and I was glad that I had trusted in patience.
