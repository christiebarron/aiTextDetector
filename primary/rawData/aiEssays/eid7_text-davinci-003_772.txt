I recently encountered a situation where I had to practice patience. I was out shopping with my teenage daughter who takes forever to make decisions! We had only been out for a few hours and she still hadn't been able to make up her mind on anything. I found myself growing increasingly frustrated as time went on.

However, I knew that she needed a little more time to make her decisions and ultimately get what she wanted. So instead of giving in to my frustration, I decided to practice being patient. I kept in mind that this was a learning experience for her, and that she eventually had to learn how to make decisions for herself.

I decided to try and focus on other things, like people watching, to take my mind off the situation. I also reminded myself to stay positive and be encouraging. After almost three hours of shopping, she finally made her decision!

When it was all said and done, I was proud of myself for managing to stay patient and encouraging despite the long process. Not only did she gain a valuable lesson from this experience, but I also learned how important it can be to practice patience in a situation like that.
