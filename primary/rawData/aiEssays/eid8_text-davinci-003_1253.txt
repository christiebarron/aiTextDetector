I had been invited out to dinner by my friend Bob to celebrate his recent promotion. It had been a while since we had gotten together, so when he told me to meet him at an Italian restaurant, I was really looking forward to an evening of catching up. 

When I arrived, Bob was already sitting at the table, but his face lacked the happiness it normally carried. It was obvious something was bothering him. After I took my seat and exchanged pleasantries, I asked him what was wrong. 

He sighed and told me he had just been through a rough few months. He had worked very hard for the promotion, but had received mixed feedback from his colleagues and now he was losing motivation. I wasn't sure what to say, so I just offered an awkward pat on the back.

But, then, something incredible happened. Bob couldn't help but crack a smile. Suddenly, we were both laughing, despite all his worries. Our worries were still there—they weren't going away—but they were suddenly easier to bear when we laughed together. We could joke, tease each other, and remember better times. 

After that moment, Bob seemed to become more cheerful and motivated. He found the courage to go back to work and take on new projects and initiatives. 

That night, our laughter brought comfort to us both. It didn't solve all his problems, but it was the start of the road to recovery.
