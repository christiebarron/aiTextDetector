Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” speaks to the resilience and perseverance of the human spirit. Through the lens of a young girl, it illustrates how the cyclical nature of life can give one hope, no matter how daunting the circumstances.

The poem’s protagonist is in the middle of a difficult academic test that she is struggling to complete. Like the hibiscus flower in her garden, the task ahead of her feels overwhelming. Yet her determination manifests in her conviction to face the challenge again when the snow melts and the geese return.

This final line carries an important lesson. The symbolism of the flower and the birds is a stark reminder that no matter how grave the situation, life eventually moves on and nature prevails. Even in the face of a seemingly impossible task, the protagonist takes solace in knowing that the odds of success may improve over time if she keeps trying.

This idea of resilience and adaptability—of never giving up even when faced with insurmountable odds—is a fundamental lesson from Ho’s poem. It speaks to an intrinsic, inner strength that is capable of even the most difficult of trials. Such strength is rarely seen in life’s ordinary moments, but it is often the driving force that pushes us forward, even in the face of adversity. 

Ultimately, Ho’s poem reflects the hope that exists in life’s toughest moments. It encourages us to keep working towards our goals, and with patience, we can be rewarded in the end.
