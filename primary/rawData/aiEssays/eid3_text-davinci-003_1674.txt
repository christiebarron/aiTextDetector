The setting in Joe Kurmaski's poem "Rough Road Ahead" plays a significant role in conveying the cyclist's experience. The poet captures the cyclist's emotions with powerful images of the setting and how they affect the cyclist's journey.

The poem begins with an overall description of the route, described in negative terms: "A dark and foreboding stretch of single lane road/Stones, gravel, holes, and deep ruts." These conditions serve as an ominous warning to the cyclist, foreshadowing the difficult nature of the road ahead. The narrow and winding nature of the street further enhances the tense mood of the poem. Through the description of the setting, the poet effectively establishes a sense of danger that reinforces the cyclist's feelings of vulnerability as they traverse the unknown journey.

The poem also emphasizes how isolated the cyclist is as they travel through such desolate surroundings. The lack of other travelers on the roadway and the lack of light intensifies the cyclist's feeling of solitude. The "distant mountains" and "dark line of trees" create an image of a vast and empty landscape, emphasizing the feeling of utter helplessness that the cyclist experiences in the face of such a tumultuous journey.
