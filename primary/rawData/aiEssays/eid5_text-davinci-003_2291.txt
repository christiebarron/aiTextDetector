From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is a collection of short memoirs exploring the author's identity, immigration, family and culture. Spanning just over one hundred deeply personal and heartfelt pages, the memoir is filled with a bittersweet nostalgia and longings of home.

As a Cuban immigrant living in America, Rodriguez is frequently met with feelings of displacement and alienation. These feelings are reflected in the lyrical descriptors and vivid imagery, as Rodriguez moves between his past and present, between his Cuban home and the American lifestyle he has adopted without fully embracing. Through his words, it is possible to feel the disparity between two different cultures, two drastically-altered lives, and the nostalgia and longing that accompany them.

In one specific memoir, Rodriguez reflects upon his grandmother's home and how memories of her still linger in the walls. Here, Rodriguez creates a mood of sadness and reflection, of tenderness and joy, with loving descriptions of his family and the house in which they all lived together. He recalls laughter and music, the smells and flavors of the neighbor's cooking, and the merriment of family gatherings. Despite being filled with fond memories, there is a pervading sense of longing for the past yet it is balanced by Rodriguez's strength and resilience. 

It is with this resilience and courage that we are encouraged to stay rooted in our identity and culture, no matter how far away from home life takes us. His memoir is ultimately a reminder of how the warmth of home can never be replaced and the power of the memories which remain.
