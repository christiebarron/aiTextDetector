I was at the grocery store last week and there was a woman ahead of me in line. She had a lot of items and I could tell the cashier was having a bit of difficulty scanning everything. I looked around and noticed that other shoppers were becoming impatient and making comments about how long it was taking.

But instead of joining in, I decided to stay patient. I smiled at the cashier, gave them a nod of encouragement, and waited patiently for my turn. 
Eventually, the woman finished and it was my turn. The cashier thanked me for my patience and we exchanged pleasantries as I paid and left.

I'm glad I didn't give in to the temptation to rush the woman in front of me, or complain about the wait. By remaining patient and understanding, I was able to show the cashier kindness and respect.
