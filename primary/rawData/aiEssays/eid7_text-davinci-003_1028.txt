I remember a time when I was at a friend's house and we were trying to put a puzzle together. We spent hours trying to figure out what the puzzle was supposed to look like, but no matter how hard we tried, we weren't able to make it work. 
My friend started getting frustrated and gave up, but I decided to stay calm and patient. I could tell he was feeling overwhelmed, so I suggested taking a break and coming back to it later. We ended up coming back after a few hours, and it only took us a few minutes to complete the puzzle. 
My friend was so grateful that I had stayed patient with him and not given up. We both had a lot of fun, and it taught me to remain calm and patient in difficult situations.
