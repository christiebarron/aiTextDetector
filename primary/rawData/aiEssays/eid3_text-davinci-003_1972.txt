In Joe Kurmaski's story, 'Rough Road Ahead', the setting is critical in understanding the cyclist's experience. The story is set in early summer, on a rural road outside of a small town in Montana. This setting is described as having “no shade, just sun, the chalky dust of the road, and prickly weeds along the shoulders”. The environment is described as “dry and desolate” and the heat is “so heavy that it seems to push down from the sky”. 

The climatic and geographic setting of the story plays an important role in affecting the cyclist. This setting creates a sense of harshness and desolation, conveying the arduous nature of the trip. The sun is oppressive, offering no respite from the heat, and combined with the dust, it creates an uncomfortable and possibly dangerous environment. In no small way, these conditions make the trip even more difficult and strenuous for the cyclist. Without shade, there is a lack of any kind of protection from the sun’s oppressive heat, with nothing but the road’s “sprawling emptiness” to accompany him.
