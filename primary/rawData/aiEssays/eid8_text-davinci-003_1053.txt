Laughter is one of my favorite things in the world. As soon as I cracked a joke, my best friend would burst into laughter and I couldn't help but join in.

One time, we were walking down the street and my friend stumbled over a crack in the pavement. She immediately burst into laughter, even though tripping over cracks in the pavement could be embarrassing. I joined in, not holding back my laughter either.

To this day, I remember that moment walking down the street together, our laughter overlapping as if it was meant to be. It was more than just laughter; it felt like a moment of connection and unity that brought us both even closer together. And that's the power of laughter â€” it can bridge the divide between two people, no matter how far apart we are.
