I vividly remember my final year of university. After years of studying and working hard, it was finally time to graduate. Unfortunately, I had fallen quite ill a few weeks before my finals examinations and the day of the test had arrived. Although the doctor had cleared me to attend the examination, I was still feeling very weak and anxious.

With a heavy heart, I decided to go to the test centre and gather my courage. It was the first time that I was attending an exam without feeling prepared. However, before I could enter the examination hall, I was stopped by the security guard. He had confused me with another person who was not supposed to be there.

Despite being tense, I collected my patience and started to explain my situation to the security guard. I knew I was short on time and that I needed to make every second count. I recounted every detail of my registration to make sure that I was cleared to enter the examination. To my relief, the security guard finally realised his mistake and apologised.

He then allowed me to enter the exam hall. I was extremely glad to know that I will still be able to take the exam, despite all the confusion. I am proud to say that I managed to pass the examination and I credit my success to being patient in a difficult situation.
