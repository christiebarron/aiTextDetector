I was visiting my aunt in the hospital a few years ago, and as I was in the hallway waiting to see her, I noticed that the nurse had a crowd of difficult patients he was helping. Each person was arguing their case, while demanding to be seen first. Even though they were all being incredibly demanding and rude, the nurse remained calm and level headed.

I was really impressed by his patience and understanding, and it put me at ease. He continued to speak to each of them with respect, understanding and empathy, carefully listening to every complaint, and addressing each one of them in turn. Even though the situation had become quite heated, he managed to diffuse the situation by being patient.

At the time, I was impressed and taken aback. I thought it was a great example of how being patient and understanding can go a long way in a difficult situation, and I still use that example today when dealing with difficult people.
