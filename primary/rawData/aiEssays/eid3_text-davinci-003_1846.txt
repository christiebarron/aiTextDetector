The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski is extremely important since it is the main source of adversity for the cyclist. The story is set in the midwest, in Kansas and Nebraska, right after the great depression. This is evident because Kurmaski mentions in passing the abandoned farmhouses the cyclist passes along the way, providing the reader with a distinct vision of the time period.

The harsh, rural midwest setting serves as a stunning backdrop to the cyclist’s journey. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist faces a hard, lonely road full of grueling hills as he fights against the strong winds of the plains. The cyclist persists despite the difficult terrain, but the rugged landscape eventually starts to wear him down. The rolling hills become increasingly difficult to traverse, with progress becoming even slower the further he gets. The long stretches with no towns or settlements further add to the cyclist’s fatigue, making him feel as if he is one of the few things still bravely struggling against the harsh elements of the midwest plains.

The features of the setting thus become an obstacle that the cyclist must overcome in order to reach his destination. The cyclist learns to persevere
