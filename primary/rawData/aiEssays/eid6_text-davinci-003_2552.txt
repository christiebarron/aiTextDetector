The Empire State Building is a world-renowned landmark that stands as a symbol of American ingenuity and ambition. Since the building's completion in 1931, the top of its mooring mast has served as a docking port for dirigibles, allowing them to drop off their passengers and cargo into the bustling city of New York. Despite the convenience of the mooring mast, the process by which it was made possible was plagued by numerous obstacles that may have otherwise hindered its inclusion in the tower's design. 

In the early design stages of the construction of the Empire State Building, planners wanted to include the mooring mast as a way of accommodating dirigibles, but this posed a major obstacle in itself: there was no existing technical guidelines for its design or for the docking process. At the time, existing mooring masts were designed for smaller aircraft and lacked the safety features necessary for the construction of a larger, more technically advanced version. Without a plan that included these features, planners knew the mooring mast would be dangerous and potentially even deadly to pilots and passengers.

In addition to safety concerns, there were also logistical issues to consider. At the time, dirigibles were still a relatively new technology and required a more complex landing process than smaller aircraft. This process entailed very specific procedures that involved navigating a variety of factors, such as wind speed and direction, visibility, and the size and weight of the passengers and cargo. Without an appropriate landing procedure in place, dirigibles could not dock safely and effectively at the Empire State Building.
