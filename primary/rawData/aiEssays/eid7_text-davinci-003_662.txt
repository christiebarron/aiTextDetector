I remember one time when I was on a school field trip and we had to wait for two hours for a bus that got stuck in traffic. Everyone around me was getting really frustrated and impatient. Some students were grumbling and some were shouting at the bus driver. 

But I just stayed calm, focusing on my book, taking deep breaths and thinking positive thoughts. I was determined to stay patient, knowing that this experience was out of my control and that I just needed to make the best of it. 

I managed to stay patient in a stressful and uncomfortable situation. When the bus finally arrived, I felt relieved and proud of myself for being able to stay composed and patient.
