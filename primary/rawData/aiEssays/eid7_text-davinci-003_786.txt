I remember when I was in middle school, I had a math test coming up and I was feeling really anxious and overwhelmed. All my classmates were talking about how hard the test would be, and I was already stressed about it.

I went to my math teacher for help, but he was swamped with other students and couldn't give me the attention I wanted. I could see I was bothering him so I started to apologize and was about to leave when he told me to stay put. He said I was asking good questions and didn't mind me being there.

He took his time to answer my questions and drew diagrams to explain the material. I hadn't realized how much I had been stressing out over the test until he helped me to relax and understand the material better.

His patience with me really helped me to control my nerves before the test and I ended up getting one of the highest grades in the class. I was so relieved and thankful for my teacher's patience. It was a valuable lesson that I still carry with me today.
