I recently had a situation in a store that demonstrated how being patient can really help a situation. I was in a big retail store and was looking for a few items for some projects I was working on. As I was searching the shelves, I noticed there was only one employee in the store who was helping people check out at the registers. I could see that the line waiting to check out was really long and there were still a lot of people in the store doing their shopping. 

I was getting a bit frustrated but I decided to be patient and wait my turn. I eventually noticed that a second employee was brought in to help with the checkouts which made things move along much faster. I felt relieved and thanked the employee who had taken the initiative to call in help. I made sure to express my gratitude as I was checking out.

My patience payed off in this instance and ultimately taught me the importance of being patient in situations like this. It can have a positive impact on the outcome.
