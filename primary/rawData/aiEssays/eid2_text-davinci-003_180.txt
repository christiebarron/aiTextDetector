When speaking about censorship in libraries, it is important to understand both the school of thought for those who advocate for freedom of expression and the thought of those who argue for a moralistic approach to library materials. In regards to the latter, it can undoubtedly be argued that certain materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. 

The primary argument in favor of censorship is protection. Supporters of this viewpoint believe that information in public libraries should be curbed so as to not corrupt the youth. The belief being that by restricted access to immoral material, the youth can be saved from adults’ moral corruption. While this may seem over-simplistic, there is some validity to this thought process. The brain of a child is still forming, and giving them access to materials that can potentially damage their moral compass is arguably not the right thing to do. 

However, ideas that are seen as “morally offensive” in one culture may not be deemed offensive in another and should therefore not be restricted everywhere. There is a need for an objective analysis to determine whether or not a material is truly offensive and therefore harmful in a given context. Moreover, removing books, magazines, movies, or music from the library without looking into the underlying reasons for their offensive nature not only has potential to be oppressive, but is also a problematic form of censorship.

In conclusion, the concept of censorship for libraries is complex. Allowing the youth access to inappropriate materials risks their moralistic development, but censorship should not be unified, as it disregards
