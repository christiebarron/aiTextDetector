I was waiting for the train. It had been about five minutes since I'd arrived at the station and there was still no sign of the train. I was getting frustrated and impatient. Passengers around me, including myself, were growing anxious. We all started talking, wondering aloud when the train would come.

Then, suddenly, a voice silenced us. I looked around to see an elderly man on the platform, who calmly said,"It's OK. Don't worry. We just have to have patience."

I have to admit, I was taken aback by his words. His calm demeanor had quickly and easily quelled our collective anxiety. The man just simply smiled and nodded at us, as if he understood our feelings of frustration and impatience. He spoke no more words of wisdom, yet his presence was enough to make a difference.

In that moment, I was amazed and humbled by this man's incredible patience. He taught me a valuable lesson by simply being present and by responding to our collective anxiety in the most meaningful way. To this day, I remember his words and his gentle demeanor. I try to pass on his message of patience to others around me, in hopes that I too can potentially teach someone that same valuable lesson.
