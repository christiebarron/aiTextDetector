I was out shopping on a Saturday morning with my two children, and it was not going as planned. The kids were both in a cranky mood and every decision that needed to be made, like what brand of juice to buy, threw them into a fit of complaining and bickering. 

While this was frustrating and exhausting, I chose to take a deep breaths and remain calm. I knew if I reacted negatively, the situation would only become worse. So, with lots of patience and understanding, I calmly explained to them why we couldnâ€™t buy certain things and reassured them that they could have something they would like. 

As I knew it would, their moods improved after a few minutes and by the end of the shopping trip, we were all laughing and joking as we headed back home. I was glad I had been patient and kept a positive attitude in the face of trying circumstances.
