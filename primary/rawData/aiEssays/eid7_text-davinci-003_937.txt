I was visiting my grandmother in another town when I got a call from a friend. She was in a jam and asked for my help. I was about to leave my grandmother's house when she stopped me and said, "It's ok, go and help your friend when you have the chance. She needs you now." 

I was surprised at her selflessness and understanding. Despite being eager to spend time with her, she put her needs aside to prioritize those of someone else. I was touched by her patience and kindness and drove to meet my friend. When I arrived, she told me all about her problem, and I was glad to help. 

My grandmother's patience and understanding made a difference that day. She could've easily been disappointed and hurt, but she put it aside and did what she could to help a friend in need. It was a truly remarkable example of patience.
