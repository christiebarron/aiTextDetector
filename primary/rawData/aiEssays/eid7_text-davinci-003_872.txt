I remember back in school, I was in fifth grade and our teacher had assigned a huge project. It was a lot of work and I was overwhelmed. With all the other classes, homework and activities I had going on, I was honestly just ready to give up. I could feel the frustration bubbling inside of me, but I knew I had to stay patient and find a way to make it work. 

So I made a plan. I broke the project up into manageable parts with incremental deadlines, and I committed to tackling a section each night. I reminded myself to stay patient and believe that I had the capability to get through it, even if it felt overwhelming. I gave myself a reward each time I reached one of my mini-goals, which made the whole process seem more doable.

I'm grateful that I stayed patient and kept working on the project. It was such a huge accomplishment and I really felt proud of what I had created in the end. Patience ultimately paid off and I learned that no matter how hard something may seem, if I just break it down into more manageable pieces, it doesn't have to be so overwhelming.
