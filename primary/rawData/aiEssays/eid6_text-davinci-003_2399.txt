In the 1930s, when the Empire State Building was being built, the promise of dirigibles docking atop the building was a revolutionary concept. Yet the challenges to make this a reality seemed insurmountable. As stated in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, “U.S. leaders at the time found the idea of anchored dirigibles fundamentally radical and risky.” 

To begin with, the building’s architects and engineers had to come up with a new way of constructing the building, which was much taller than the tallest building previously constructed. This would involve creating steel-framed floors and walls that could support the airship anchor and mooring station.

Additionally, the top of the Empire State Building had to be secured and capable of accommodating these large aircrafts. To do this, an additional steel weight of 200 tons had to be added to the top of the building in order to counterbalance the airships. Furthermore, the mooring station on the building had to be designed with a winder which would give pilots the ability to control the speed of ascent or descent. 

The safety protocols required for dirigibles to be able to dock were also an obstacle. Passengers would need to exit the dirigible while it was stationary, so gates and elevators were also put in place to ensure passengers could disembark safely. 

Finally, budget constraints had to be taken into consideration. This eventuality would require significant funds to employ the necessary workforce and use the necessary materials. As a result, the owners of the Empire State Building
