Censorship in libraries is an important issue that should not be overlooked. As advocates of free speech and expression, libraries should allow for individuals to be able to access a wide variety of materials without fear of censorship. Censorship could lead to restricting an individual’s access to necessary information and resources, which could be damaging to an individual’s development, education, and well-being. 

The purpose of a library is to provide access to a wide range of materials, no matter how offensive it may seem to some people. If a book, magazine, movie, or album is found to be offensive, then it should not be removed from the shelves. Instead, it should be moved to another area away from main circulation and still allow individuals to access it if they choose to. This would allow individuals to have access to all the materials that a library provides, while also protecting those that may find those materials offensive. 

Censoring certain materials based on someone’s opinion of them could lead to certain ideologies, topics, and ideas from being silenced. Libraries should strive to provide people with the support to seek out knowledge and information. By removing materials from circulation, libraries would be affecting an individual’s freedom to pursue information that may help in their development. 

Rather than censoring the materials on the shelves, libraries should be educating the community. Librarians can provide guidance and advice to those who have questions about certain materials, as well as educate individuals on the topics presented in those materials in order to promote understanding and open-mindedness.
