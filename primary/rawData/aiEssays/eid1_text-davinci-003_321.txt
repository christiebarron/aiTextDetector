Dear [name of newspaper],

I am writing today to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. With the ever-increasing availability of computing devices, it is clear to me that computers are playing an increasingly important role in many aspects of our lives.

My opinion is that computers have had a largely positive effect on people. In the workplace, this is particularly evident as computers provide us with access to a wealth of information, enabling us to work more efficiently and with greater accuracy. Additionally, computers make it much easier to research, store and share data. Computers have been invaluable in allowing us to stay connected with loved ones, and many people now have access to educational resources that they would have had no access to before. We as consumers have greater access to goods and services than ever before â€“ made possible by advances in technology, such as online ordering and delivery.

Of course, it would be remiss to ignore the potential risks that come with using computers, such as the risk of cybercrime. However, it is my belief that these risks can be mitigated by proactive measures such as the use of strong passwords and other security measures.

Overall, I firmly believe that computers have had a vast array of positive impacts on us, as individuals and as members of society. We should therefore be embracing this technology and recognizing the invaluable role it has played in our lives. 

Yours, 
[Your name]
