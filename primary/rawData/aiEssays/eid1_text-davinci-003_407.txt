Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

Today, it is hard to go anywhere without seeing some form of a computer. They are being used in classrooms, medical facilities, businesses and homes. Because of the vast number of advances made in the computer world, we have access to a great deal of information, faster decisions and a much more efficient lifestyle. 

However, with the abundant access to computers and their resources comes some negatives as well. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the effects these machines have had on people in terms of physical and mental health. Studies show that extensive computer use has been linked to carpal tunnel syndrome, loss of vision, neck, back and shoulder pain, depression and anxiety. Therefore, it is important to consider moderating the amount of time spent on the computer.

I believe that computers have the potential to be the gateway of limitless opportunities and can create a better life for people if used in moderation. They are a fantastic tool that will only keep advancing in years to come, but it is our responsibility to remember that too much of anything can be damaging.

Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion. 

Sincerely,
[Name]
