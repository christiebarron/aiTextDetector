I remember one time, when I was eight years old, when I had to learn just how important patience could be. It was the first time I had ever traveled without my family, and I was flying to visit my aunt who lived on the other side of the country. 

I wasn't prepared for the amount of time that the entire process would take. Waiting in the long lines at the airport, waiting to board the plane, getting settled on the plane, and waiting for the entire flight to arrive at my final destination. I remember feeling so a frustrated and anxious while I was waiting, not really understanding why I had to spend so much time just sitting around. 

That's when my aunt stepped in. She could tell how much I was struggling with being patient, so she engaged me in conversations about different topics the entire time we were waiting. Talking about animals, books, movies and more was a great distraction for me, and I quickly realized that patience doesn't have to mean just sitting around and waiting. I also realized that it was okay to take my time and enjoy the journey, instead of just rushing to the finish line.

Ever since that day, I've adopted a more patient and relaxed approach to life, especially when it comes to traveling. I now know that patience is key and it can make any journey much more enjoyable!
