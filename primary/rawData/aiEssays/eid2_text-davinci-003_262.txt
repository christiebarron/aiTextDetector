Recently, there has been a considerable discussion about whether certain materials should be censored in libraries. Many people argue that certain materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. 

I argue that censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Every individual has the right to access to information and resources. Restricting access to certain materials can lead to the deprivation of the public’s right to the freedom of thought and self-expression. Censoring books and materials in libraries means silencing minority voices and limiting the public’s ability to explore diverse views. 

Furthermore, libraries are intended to provide an open access to information for all members of society. From children to adults, everyone should have the opportunity to search freely for information and resources. By banning certain materials, libraries are curtailing access to knowledge, which defeats their purpose. 

In addition, censorship affects the readership of the young generation. When certain books and materials are suppressed, the youth are deprived of the opportunity to analyse and form their own opinion. In other words, blocking certain materials reduces their ability to explore and challenge their beliefs. 

In conclusion, censorship in libraries should not be permitted. Banning certain materials would ostracize certain groups, reduce access to knowledge, and limit the public’s right to explore and form their own opinion. It is essential for libraries to remain a vessel for knowledge and information, without allowing censorship in any form.
