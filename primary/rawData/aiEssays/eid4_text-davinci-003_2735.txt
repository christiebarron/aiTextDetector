The ending of Minfong Ho's poem "Winter Hibiscus" can be interpreted in a variety of ways; however, their most apparent interpretation is that of overcoming obstacles and striving for personal growth. By linking the hibiscus to a test that the narrator will take once it buds in the spring, the poem provides a hopeful metaphor for undaunted perseverance despite great difficulty. 

The hibiscus is a flower known to be unable to survive the winter season, withering and eventually dying amidst the snow and cold. For the narrator, this reflects their own struggles with the test they had been preparing for, which they could not pass yet despite their relentless efforts. Despite this, they remain focused on the eventual revival of spring and the courage to try again after their initial failure.

The hibiscus symbolizes the narrator's journey of perseverance and hope despite their adverse circumstances. Its resiliency inspires the narrator to continue to strive for success despite the odds being against them. Through the metaphor of winter and spring, the narrator realizes that taking that test again is a possibility and symbolizes the demise and rebirth of their inner self. 

Additionally, the imagery of the geese returning further contextualizes the narrator's journey of personal growth. As Ho states, "just like geese wait for the cold to be over, I too wait for the snow to melt". Through the example of the geese, resilience and strength are conveyed, demonstrating the importance of not giving up. This message of bravery and strength throughout difficulty is ultimately the takeaway from Ho's poem. As a result,
