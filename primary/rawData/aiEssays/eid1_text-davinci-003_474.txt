Dear Editor,

I'm writing to discuss the impact of computers on people, and to persuade readers to think critically about the ways in which technology affects our lives.

The proliferation of computers in our lives has had both positive and negative impacts. On the one hand, it is undeniable that computers have made our lives much more efficient. They have enabled us to access information quickly, learn new skills, and diagnose and treat illnesses. On the other hand, computers have been linked to an increase in sedentary lifestyles, which has been linked to an increase in physical health problems.

I believe that computers are a valuable tool, but we must be mindful of the way in which we use them and of the potential harms they can create. We must strive to use computers in a responsible way and limit our reliance on them for activities such as transportation and exercise. We must look for ways to foster social connections and physical activity in our lives.

I'm not suggesting that we throw our computers away, but I do believe that it is important to be mindful of the way in which we use them. Computers can be an invaluable tool, but they can also be harmful if they are used without caution.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
