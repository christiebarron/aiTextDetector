I was out with my friends one night and the conversation started to slow. We had exhausted all the funny stories we knew and were starting to worry that the night had come to an end. Then, out of nowhere, my best friend started telling a story. It wasn't particularly funny, but the way he was telling it had me in hysterics. His facial expressions, his intonation â€“ it was like nothing I had seen before. I tried to keep it together but eventually I just couldn't anymore and burst out laughing. To my surprise, my friend started to laugh too. There he was, laughing alongside me, and it was one of the most genuine feelings of joy I have ever experienced. Since that night, laughter has been a cornerstone of our friendship. Even when times get tough, we make sure to have a good laugh together in order to stay connected. It's amazing how laughter can truly make relationships stronger.
