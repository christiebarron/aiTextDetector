I was on my way to an important meeting when I got stuck in traffic. Outside, it seemed like the entirety of the city had converged onto the same stretch of highway, and no matter how hard I honked, the cars weren't making any progress. 

I watched the minutes tick by, trying to stay calm. All I could do was wait - and hope I wouldn't be too late for the meeting. I found myself getting annoyed, wanting to shout from the window and yell at someone, but I kept it all in. I reminded myself to be patient and think of the bigger picture. 

Finally after 20 minutes, the cars began to move again, albeit slowly. I stayed within the speed limit and waited out my turn. Once I arrived at my destination, I realized I had made it on time, and it was all thanks to my patience. It was a good reminder to take everything in my stride and stay composed regardless of the circumstances.
