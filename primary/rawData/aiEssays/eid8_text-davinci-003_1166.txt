I’ll never forget the first time I laughed with my new partner. We had only been dating for a few weeks when we decided to take a drive together one Sunday morning. We were talking and having a good time and suddenly he did something so silly that I burst out laughing. 

It was this silly giggle, he was doing this funny little rhythm with his hands while he was singing some song that I didn’t know. I laughed so hard that my stomach started to hurt and I even shed a few tears.

He was laughing too and the joy that filled the car was so strong that it was almost like a tangible thing. We continued talking as we drove and we found ourselves connecting on a level that I didn’t even realize was possible. We were both on the same wavelength, laughing at the same things, and understanding each other in ways we didn’t know existed. 

That moment felt like a turning point for our relationship and I’m so grateful for it. Laughter is one of the most powerful tools in any relationship, and it has definitely been an integral part of our journey so far. We’ve laughed together so many times since then and I know that it’s only going to continue to make our relationship stronger.
