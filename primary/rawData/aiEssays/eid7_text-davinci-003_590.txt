I remember a time when I was out shopping with my mother. She had to get a lot of things and we spent a good amount of time in the store. We went to the checkout line and noticed that it was extremely long. My mom looked at the line and sighed. I silently could tell she was getting frustrated.

However, instead of expressing it, she just accepted it and waited patiently in line. Even though other people were getting annoyed and impatient, my mom stayed calm and kept her cool.

I admired her patience and reminded myself to stay as patient as she did in future situations. Her attitude was a great example of how to stay relaxed and remain positive in difficult situations.
