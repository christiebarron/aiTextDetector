The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" greatly affects the experience of the cyclist, from the physical sensations to the deeper emotion and atmosphere of the journey. 

The cyclist in the story is traveling through the rainforest and the rising sun casts a strange, almost ethereal light across the trails. The cyclist is met with the smells of wetlands, salt, and dank soil, while soft and hard textures fill the air. The trails are littered with vines and tree roots, and on occasion rocky patches. All of these details work together to create an atmosphere of intense physicality and adventure that the cyclist feels, as if they have been thrown right into a different world. 

The weather also heightens the intensity of the journey and the cyclist's experience. The rain falling lightly on the cyclist's head and the misty, wet atmosphere seem to create an insular and immersive experience. The cyclist is alone in the forest, isolated from the world outside, but surrounded by the beauty of nature. The rain also creates a different kind of challenge for the cyclist, as both the terrain and the weather add to the difficult of the journey.
