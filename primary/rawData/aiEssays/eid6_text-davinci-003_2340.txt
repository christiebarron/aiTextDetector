The Empire State Building was the world’s first skyscraper to feature a mooring mast for dirigibles. Despite the amazing potential this offered for travel, the builders encountered a number of obstacles that prevented the successful implementation of a docking system.

The first challenge was the structural integrity of the mast itself. It was built to a height of 400 feet and was designed to be light enough to be supported by the building’s steel frame. However, at the same time, it needed to be strong enough to safely hold up the much heavier burden of an airship. This meant that it had to withstand extreme wind and weather conditions and it was only due to the considerable engineering skill of chief architect William Smith Lamb that the design achieved this.

Another obstacle was the development of a practical system for docking the dirigibles. While the mooring mast provided a secure point for the airship to attach to, there was still the intricate details of the process itself to be figured out. In particular, it was difficult to ensure that the airship could stop and attach itself successfully in the short time-frame provided. After numerous trial and error attempts, the builders eventually figured out the optimal speed, approach angle and distance from the mast that had to be used.

Finally, the builders had to address the much broader issue of public safety. Despite the exacting engineering for the mast, there was always the chance of the airship crashing or causing significant damage to the city. To this end, the mooring mast was initially used only for showy promotional events and it was only when the designers
