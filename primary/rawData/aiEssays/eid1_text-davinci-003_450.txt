Dear Editor, 

Recently, there have been many debates about the effects computers have on people. My opinion is that computers positively impact people in many ways. They can provide access to knowledge, skills, and connections from all around the world.

One of the biggest advantages of computers is having access to endless information on the internet. It is a great tool for learning and researching. In addition, computers can often help people save time and money. For example, with the ability to shop online, we no longer need to waste time driving to the store, waiting in line, or struggling to find the right product. As a result, we can save both time and money.

Furthermore, computers are also great at connecting people. Social media, video calls, and chatrooms allow us to have conversations with anyone from any place. Communications around the world have improved in leaps and bounds with the help of computers.

In conclusion, computers are powerful tools that have a positive impact on modern life. They provide access to knowledge, skills, and connections—allowing people to connect and learn from each other better. That is why I believe that computers are an incredibly valuable asset in today’s world. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
