To the Editor of [Newspaper Name],

In today's world it is impossible to overlook the enormous impact and influence computers have on our lives. From the advancements in technology we are able to work smarter and faster, both increasing efficiency and productivity. However, it is also important to consider the potential negative effects computers can have on individuals.

For some people, too much reliance on computers can be overwhelming and stressful. Many might experience anxiety from the idea of having to constantly remain updated with the newest innovations, especially if their job depends on computer use. According to a survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of adults unable to adequately use computers is increasing. This could be due to a lack of trust in using or understanding computers, or even an individual's lack of interest.

In addition to the stress computers can bring, technology can also have a considerable impact on our social skills, specifically in younger generations. With teenagers and adults alike spending so much time with screens as a primary source of entertainment, it can lead to a lack of social communication, leaving them vulnerable to more serious issues including depression and anxiety.

While computers are no doubt invaluable to modern living, it is essential to consider their consequences. They can both improve and hinder our mental health, depending on how much attention we pay to the deeper implications of our computer use.
