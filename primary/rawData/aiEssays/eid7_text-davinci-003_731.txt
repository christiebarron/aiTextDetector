I recently went to the doctor to get a checkup. It was my first time at this particular clinic, and the wait times were a bit longer than I expected. I was getting a little impatient when I saw that the wait time was stretching out and I had to keep rescheduling. 

But the receptionist noticed my frustration, and she offered a kind smile and explained that the doctor was dealing with an emergency and would be with me as soon as possible. Knowing this, I decided to stay and be patient. 

I ended up waiting almost two hours, but the staff at the clinic were very apologetic and understanding. They offered me snacks and drinks to pass the time. Once the doctor was available, he spent a long time going over all my tests and results, and explaining things to me in a way that I could understand. 

In the end, I was very thankful that I had stayed, and I was proud of myself for being patient. It was a great reminder that it's important to listen and be understanding when things don't go as we planned.
