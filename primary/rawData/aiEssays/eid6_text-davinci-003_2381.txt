The architects of the Empire State Building envisioned a future in which air travel by dirigible was commonplace. To make this vision achievable, the building was designed to be capable of having dirigibles dock at the top. Despite these ambitious plans, the Empire State Building encountered a number of physical and logistical obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle was the design of the building itself, which wasnâ€™t originally intended to accommodate docking of airships. The designers were forced to make modifications to the top of the tower to allow the mooring mast to attach securely and provide enough clearance for the dirigibles to land. In addition, the mooring mast had to be designed to be weather-resistant, strong enough to endure the buffeting winds, and lightweight enough to not unduly burden the top of the building.

The second obstacle was in finding the appropriate materials to construct the mooring mast. The mooring mast must be able to withstand the variable forces of the mooring rope and out of safety regulations, it must also be insulated to be lightning and wind-protected. Because of the strength requirements and poor accessibility of the top of the building, few construction materials met the criteria, and the ones that did were too expensive.

The third and most difficult obstacle was dealing with the logistics of airships and their passengers. The biggest challenge was with the commercial airships, which ran regular daily flights to and from the Empire State Building, and had to avoid contact with other airships as much as possible. The mooring mast also posed a hazard, as it
