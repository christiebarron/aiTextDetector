The Empire State Building was a marvel of engineering when it was completed in 1931, one of the tallest buildings in the world, and the tallest in New York City. One unique feature of the building was the provision for dirigibles—airships—to make contact and dock with a mooring mast at the top of the building. This novel plan ended up not coming to fruition, however, for a wide variety of technical and legal challenges.

The challenges of dirigible docking were largely engineering challenges. The mooring mast needed to be light and strong enough to provide a safe and stable point of contact for the airship, while not adding too much extra weight on top of the building. Additionally, the mooring mast had to be resistant to the wind and temperatures of the upper atmosphere, and had to be tall enough to not just be taller than surrounding buildings. It also had to be set up to constantly monitor the changing wind direction at different heights and transmit that information to the airship.

In addition to the technical challenges, there were a wide variety of legal and bureaucratic issues. The airship companies had to file applications and get approval from the Department of Commerce, the Bureau of Air Commerce, and the New York City Building Department. Furthermore, they had to get insurance, and they had to sign contracts with the building owners that acknowledged their responsibility in enabling docked dirigibles.

Ultimately, while some test flights were made with the mooring mast and no dirigibles actually docked at the top of the Empire State Building, the obstacles of both a technical and bureaucratic nature proved
