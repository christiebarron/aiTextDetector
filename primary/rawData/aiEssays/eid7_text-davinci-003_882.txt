I was in line to board a flight at the airport recently when a man rushed up to the front of the line brushing past me, seemingly unaware of how rude he was being to the other passengers. It was clear that he was trying to make the flight, but because of his ability to push past others, he was already cutting into the line.

At first, I was angry and wanted to call this person out, but then I took a step back and thought of how he must be feeling. It was clear that he was trying to make the flight, so I decided to be patient. I let him stay in front of me and simply asked him to be more mindful of others in the future.

To my surprise, the man actually apologized for cutting the line and thanked me for being patient. He went on to explain that he was rushing to get a flight for his grandfather’s funeral and I was even more thankful for choosing to be patient in that situation.

The man told me that he was deeply grateful for my kindness and understanding as it really changed his outlook and allowed him to make it to the funeral in time. I’m glad that I chose to be patient in that moment and was able to help someone in such a difficult time.
