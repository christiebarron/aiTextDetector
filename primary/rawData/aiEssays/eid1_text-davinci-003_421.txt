Dear Editor,

In recent years, the ubiquity of computers in our lives has become undeniable. As a result, we now find ourselves facing a growing question: what is the impact of computers on our lives?

When it comes to computers, there are both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, they can provide us with a range of entertainment options, save us time and money, and even allow us to keep in touch with family, friends, and colleagues thousands of miles away. However, on the other hand, computers are a potentially dangerous addiction that can interfere with time management and interpersonal relationships.

Overall, my opinion is that if used appropriately, computers can be of great benefit to our lives. They enable us to conduct research, learn new skills, and maintain efficient personal and business networks. But we must remember to stay aware of potential negative impacts and address them as soon as possible.

We would all be wise to find a good balance between using computers and building relationships with our counterparts in the real world. By doing so, we can ensure that computers serve to further enhance our quality of life rather than detract from it. 

Sincerely,

[Your name]
