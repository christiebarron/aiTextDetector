Dear Editor:

As technology evolves and our lives become increasingly centered around computers, it is becoming more and more obvious that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. While it is impossible to deny the convenience they bring to our lives, there are some serious consequences that come with their use that cannot be ignored. 

The positives are well known: computers allow us to connect with friends and family, stay up to date with news and events, and even gain access to a wealth of information in an instant. However, with the good can also come a great deal of bad.

Using computers can lead to a host of health issues. Those who spend long hours using computers are more prone to health problems like repetitive strain injuries, sleep deprivation, and eye strain. Additionally, improper and overly frequent use of computers can lead to a decreased motivation to be physically active, reducing a person’s overall physical health.

The mentalwell-being of people can also be affected. Excessive computer use can lead to increased stress and anxiety, as well as depression. It can also contribute to “social isolation,” a feeling of disconnection from others due to too much focus on computers.

In conclusion, while computers are extremely beneficial and convenient, they can also have devastating effects on mental and physical health. Everyone should strive to use computers in moderation to ensure their health and wellness, as well as the health and wellness of those around them.
