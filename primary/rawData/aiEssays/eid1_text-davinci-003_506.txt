Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Everywhere we look, technology is rapidly advancing and computers are an integral part of many peopleâ€™s lives. With so much information at our fingertips, computers can make our lives easier in many ways. However, there is also potential for harm.

Accounts of people spending hours in front of their computers without taking a break are becoming increasingly commonplace. Some people become so absorbed in their online activities that they sacrifice their sleep, meals, exercise and social interactions with other people in order to continue.

Moreover, while computers can provide us with an endless source of information, the amount of reliable and credible sources could be limited. As modern tools become more and more integral in our lives, we risk becoming dependent on computers and neglecting more traditional skills and resources.

It is therefore important to be aware of the potential harm computers can cause and make an effort to limit its effects. We must learn to control our use of computers and use them responsibly, while also balancing it with other activities. I urge readers to think critically about their computer habits and be mindful of how much time they spend in front of the screen.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
