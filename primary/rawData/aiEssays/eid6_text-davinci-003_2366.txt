The Empire State Building proved to be an architecture feat not only for its impressive structural height, but for one of its lesser-known distinctions: being the first tall building designed for possible docking of dirigibles. While the idea seemed promising, the actual endeavor of constructing a dirigible mooring mast on the Empire State building posed significant obstacles to the builders. 

The first major challenge that had to be addressed was the enormous weight a mooring mast would put on the building's total load. At the time, the Empire State Building had the most concentrated load ever installed on a tall structure. The engineers working on the project had to design the mast to balance its center of gravity, taking into account a 110-ton dirigible hanging from the top. Wind shear was also assessed and debated, posing a safety risk to both the occupants of the dirigible and the building itself.

The mooring mast was composed of two towers that extended from the 103rd floor of the Empire State Building into the sky, occupying the same airspace used by the Manhattan Bridge for aviation. This posed yet another obstacle for the builders, as the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, who was responsible for aviation regulations, had to approve of the mast to ensure the safety of aircrafts. As there were no existing regulations for mooring structures, the engineers had to come up with a new set of regulations and standards that had to be strictly followed.

Although the engineers of the mooring mast faced numerous obstacles, their hard work paid off and in October 1931, the mooring mast was completed. With the
