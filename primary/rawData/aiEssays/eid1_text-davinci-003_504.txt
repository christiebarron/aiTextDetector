Dear Editor:

It is no secret that the introduction of computers into the daily lives of Americans has changed our routines significantly. We have entered a new era of technological developments, making our lives simpler in many ways.

As much as we may benefit from the convenience of these devices, it is important to recognize their potential negative effects as well. Studies have found that increased screen time on devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers can lead to a variety of detrimental outcomes, including reduced physical activity, sleep disturbances, and a heightened risk of depression and anxiety. Not to mention, the added stress of social media and its poisonous competitive atmosphere can take an even bigger toll.

Given these known risks, it is crucial that we limit our exposure to these devices whenever possible. We should be mindful of how much time we spend online, and make concerted efforts to prioritize our physical and mental health, over the convenience of technology.

It is understandable that so many of us rely on computers to stay connected and informed. However, for the sake of our long-term health and well-being, it is essential that we recognize the potential consequences of over-dependence.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
