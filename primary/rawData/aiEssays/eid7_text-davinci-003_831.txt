I was in a long line at the grocery store and becoming increasingly frustrated. I had been waiting for what felt like ages and I just wanted to get out of there. That's when I noticed a woman in the line behind me. She had a young child with her who was getting fussy and getting restless. Despite this, she stayed incredibly composed and patient, patiently soothing her child and playing games with him to help pass the time. I was amazed by her gentleness and understanding. Her demeanor made me realize that I needed to take a deep breath and relax. I ended up not only finding patience for my own situation, but also admiration for this woman who seemed unfazed by her impatient surroundings.
