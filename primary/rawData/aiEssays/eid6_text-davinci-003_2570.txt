In the early twentieth century, the idea of designing a building to house dirigibles, the large, hydrogen-filled airships, came to fruition with the construction of the Empire State Building. The original plans for the building included a docking station for dirigibles, but in the end, this proved to be a challenging undertaking. This essay will evaluate the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The first challenge was the size of the building. Dirigibles were large and the Empire State Building was even larger. The top of the building had to be designed to allow for parking at the highest possible point in order to accommodate a full dirigibleâ€™s air space. In addition, the building had to be strong enough to handle the wind resistance of a dirigible. The original plans also included a network of filing cables, which would enable dirigibles to be safely moored to the building.

The second challenge was the Manhattan skyline. The Empire State Building would be significantly taller than other buildings in Manhattan, making it difficult for a dirigible to approach the building without running into other structures. In order to reduce the risk of a collision, the builders had to modify the plans to make the building more aerodynamically friendly and reduce the risk of the dirigible running into other buildings.

The third challenge was the weight of the dirigible. Dirigibles were heavy and the Empire State Building was designed to be lightweight and aerodynamic. The structure supporting the docking mast had to be designed to take the weight of a full dirigible without compromising its
