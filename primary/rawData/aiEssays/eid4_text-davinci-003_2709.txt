The poetic ending of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho is symbolic and profound. The author uses vivid imagery to depict the cycle of life and demonstrates how it applies to the narrator’s experience of repeating a test. 

The narrator reflects on the winter hibiscus and notes the struggles of the flower to thrive in a harsh and unforgiving environment. Through the imagery of the hibiscus, the narrator reveals the challenge of enduring trials that appear insurmountable. By comparing this to his own experience, he is inspired to have the same resilience in the face of adversity. 

Through the description of the geese’s seasonal migration, the author emphasizes the narrator’s own cycle of overcoming obstacles. The geese face extreme challenges of food scarcity and inclement weather yet travel thousands of miles every year for their return. In the same way, after taking the test and not achieving the desired result, the narrator must trust his inherent strength to go back for another try. 

At the end of the poem, the narrator is encouraged by nature around him to persist and persevere despite the lack of immediate results. This message is one of hope — that the upcoming spring will bring the promise of better days, and a chance to start anew. The winter hibiscus, resolute in its perseverance, ultimately serves as an inspired reminder to the narrator that they, too, can come back in the spring.
