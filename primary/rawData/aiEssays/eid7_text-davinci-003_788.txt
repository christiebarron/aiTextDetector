I recently visited my grandparents that live out of town. Grandpa is quite elderly and sometimes feels overwhelmed with visitors, so my parents warned me not to expect too much from him. I was so excited to see them though and I wanted my visit to be special, so I made sure to be very patient with him.

When I arrived at their house, Grandpa seemed very tired and didn't want to engage in conversation right away. I could tell it wasn't anything I had done, so I decided to respect his wishes and talk quietly until he was ready to talk. I waited patiently for hours, playing board games with my grandparents and never once losing my temper.

Eventually, Grandpa's energy started to come back and he began happily talking to me about his life. Over the course of the visit, he opened up and shared incredible stories full of wisdom and insight. It was so wonderful to see him in such a good mood and I'm sure my patience and understanding had a positive effect on the outcome. 

My visit with my grandparents was so special and rewarding, it was all because I was able to stay patient and understanding.
