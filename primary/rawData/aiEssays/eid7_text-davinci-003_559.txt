I was walking home from the grocery store one evening and I was stopped by an elderly woman who asked for directions to a nearby restaurant. Although I felt impatient because I had just finished shopping and was eager to get home, I stopped and listened to her. I asked a few questions to better understand where she was trying to go and then went over the directions with her. She thanked me for my help and went on her way. I appreciated her appreciation and was proud of myself for putting others before my own wants and needs. Being patient can be difficult, but in this case, it was worth it.
