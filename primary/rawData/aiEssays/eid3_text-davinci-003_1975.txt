In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist encounters unpredictable and challenging terrain, which directly impacts the cyclist's journey and experience. 

The unforgiving nature of the setting causes difficulty for the cyclist, from navigating the terrain to the physical demands the journey requires. The cyclist must overcome a steep climb, treacherous switchbacks, and rough, disheveled terrain. With fatigue and exhaustion, the cyclist steadily progresses through the terrain. It is clear that the roughness of the terrain is a factor in the unpredictability of the journey and the cyclist's ability to reach the top of the climb.
