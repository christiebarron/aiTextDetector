I was at the grocery store and I had gotten to the checkout line when I realized I had forgotten my wallet at home. I knew I couldn't pay, but I wasn't sure how to leave without creating a big disruption. The cashier must have seen the embarrassment on my face because she told me she could put my items on hold until I returned with my wallet.

I explained I had forgotten my wallet, but I didn't want to keep the cashier waiting too long. She smiled and said not to worry. She was incredibly patient despite the line of customers behind me. She asked me to pay when I came back and took the items off her register.

I hurried home to get my wallet, feeling terrible that I had held up the line. When I got back to the store, the same cashier was still there. The line had grown, but she still offered a friendly smile and welcomed me back. She rang up my items and I paid without incident.

I was so grateful for her patience - not only in waiting for me to come back with my wallet, but also in making sure my return to the store was as smooth as the first visit. She went above and beyond to ensure I left the store satisfied. I thanked her for being so understanding and for her patience. It was really a kindness I will never forget.
