The other day I was in line at the grocery store, and of course it was taking forever. Everyone around me seemed to be getting increasingly impatient, but I decided to stay patient and wait it out. 
I took a deep breath and reminded myself that I was in no rush, and that I was in control of my own emotions. I watched the other people in line getting angry and shaking their heads, and it made me even more determined to stay patient. 

Finally, the line started to move again and before I knew it, I was inching ever closer to the cashier. When it was my turn, the cashier apologized for the wait and I could tell he felt bad. Instead of getting angry, I smiled and simply said it was no problem.

Being patient was difficult but ultimately rewarding. Not only did I avoid an unpleasant situation, but I also had a chance to practice self-control and show understanding towards the cashier.
