Dear Editor,

I'm writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Technology is advancing at an incredibly rapid pace and computers have become the most important tool for learning, working, and connecting.

However, even with the incredible benefits of computers, there are some serious drawbacks that must be addressed. A recent study conducted by Harvard University suggests that addiction to computers is on the rise and that online harassment has become increasingly common.

Gambling, shopping, playing games, and viewing questionable content are all activities that can be done using computers and can lead to lost time and financial problems. The potential risks outweigh the potential benefits, making it imperative that everyone use computers responsibly. Taking breaks, limiting excessive use, and using appropriate, safety-focused sites are all good practices.

Although the technology revolution has completely changed the landscape in so many positive ways, itâ€™s important to take into consideration the negative aspects of computer use that can have far-reaching effects. I urge your readers to understand the importance of responsible computing and to ensure their own usage does not become destructive.

Sincerely,

[Name]
