Dear Editor,

I'm writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I strongly believe that computers have had a profoundly positive effect on our society.

In today's world, computers are used for almost every type of task, from researching and writing papers to creating art and music. Computers have made it much easier for us to access information and education, helping us to grow and learn more efficiently than ever before. We are even able to use computers to communicate with people all around the world, creating connections and opportunities we never would have had otherwise.

Furthermore, computers have had a large impact on our economy. They have revolutionized the way businesses operate and allowed for new types of jobs to be created. This has led to increased jobs and economic growth, allowing us to create a better situation for ourselves and future generations.

In conclusion, computers have made life easier, more efficient, more connected, and more economically secure. Therefore, I believe the effects computers have had on people have been overwhelmingly positive.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
