I was at the grocery store the other day and got in line to check out. There was a woman standing in front of me who had several items and was paying with cash. As she dug through her wallet and scattered coins on the counter to complete her payment, the cashier and I waited patiently - no one was in any rush. I could tell that she was a little embarrassed that this was taking so long, but neither the cashier nor I said anything. 

Eventually we got through the transaction and she got all of her items and left the store. It would have been easy to get frustrated and make a fuss, but I chose to be patient and understand that the situation was not deliberately happening. The cashier and I exchanged a friendly smile before they called the next person in line.
