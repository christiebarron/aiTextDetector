I recently had the opportunity to visit my grandmother, who lives in a senior retirement home. During my visit I witnessed a wonderful example of patience, as one of the staff members helped one of the elderly residents. 

The resident, who was in her late eighties, had brought a beloved family photo album to the lobby and was trying to find a particular page. She was struggling to open the album—the cover was very heavy and sheusing her limited strength struggled to move it.

The staff member, with a gentle smile, asked her if she needed help. Knowing that the resident was very proud and independent, the staff member moved slowly and kept a kind tone in her voice. Her kindness and patience was such a comfort that I could feel the resident’s stress begin to melt away. 

Finally, the staff member managed to get the cover open and, with a genuine smile on her face and sincere words of encouragement, she helped the resident locate the page. Despite her own busy schedule, the staff member took the time to make sure her patient felt comfortable, respected, and safe. It was an amazing example of patience that inspired me and made a lasting impression.
