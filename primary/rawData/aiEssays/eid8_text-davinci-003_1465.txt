I vividly remember the day when I first met my husband. I had been out with friends that night and at some point, his group joined ours. As we were all introducing ourselves, he made a joke about his surname - it was conveniently the same as mine, so I rolled my eyes and gave a slight smile. He, in turn, caught my eye, chuckled, and then proceeded to say something even funnier.

We all laughed and instantly felt this connection between us. From that moment on, I felt like he and I had something special. We talked and laughed the rest of the night, and soon after we started dating.

Throughout our relationship, laughter has been so important. We have this sort of unspoken code of understanding each other that runs on jokes and inside jokes and puns. We are big fans of subtle dry humor, so even in our most serious moments we still find ways to lightly joke.

Laughter between us is what makes our relationship so strong. We make an effort to bring out the funnier side of each other and to remind each other of things we used to find hilarious. It’s a shared bond that I cherish deeply and that I’m so lucky to have.
