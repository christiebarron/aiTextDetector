On the one hand, there are those who argue that certain materials should be removed from libraries to protect the public from objectionable content and to safeguard the values of the community. On the other, however, there are those who contend that open libraries should provide access to all kinds of literature and information, and that citizens should be allowed to make their own decisions on what they find offensive or unacceptable.

In terms of protecting the public, censorship in libraries could have a significant impact on the safety of those who use the facility. Removing materials which are deemed to be offensive or in any way harmful to individuals could be seen as a positive step in shielding vulnerable people, such as children, from the potential danger of content that some might consider to be unsuitable. Furthermore, by keeping certain books and media materials off the shelves, libraries could also act as gatekeepers in ensuring that the values and standards of any given community are upheld.

However, it is also important to consider the potential limitations of censorship in libraries. Restricting access to certain materials can lead to a narrowing of the base of information available and a reduction in the diversity of materials available to the public. This could deny readers the opportunity to explore a wide range of opinions and perspectives, thereby limiting the potential of a fully informed citizenry. Moreover, attempts to censor libraries could lead to a ‘slippery slope’ of censorship, where progressively more materials are removed from the shelves and the public’s access to information is increasingly limited and
