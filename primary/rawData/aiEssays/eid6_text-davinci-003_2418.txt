As the Empire State Building was being constructed in New York City during the early 20th century, construction crews proposed an extraordinary idea: the ability to dock dirigibles on the rooftop of the building. This plan, however, presented many engineering and development obstacles that needed to be addressed before dirigibles would be able to dock at the Empire State Building. 

The proposal for a docking point for dirigibles was outlined in the book, “The Mooring Mast”, written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. Engineers from the Empire State Building development team wanted to establish a secure mooring mast on the building, with a height of 800 feet, which is about 400 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty. The mooring mast would be strong enough to secure a dirigible, an airship which is composed of a metal or fabric hull filled with a gas lighter than air. 

A major engineering challenge that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was designing a mooring mast with a solid foundation that could handle the intense wind forces of a docked dirigible on the wild weather of the New York City skyline. Furthermore, the installation process had to be done without putting the safety of workers in jeopardy, as the work had to be done on the outer edges and rooftop of the building. Additionally, the diameter of a dirigible could exceed 200 feet at times, making it necessary for the mooring mast to be wide enough and strong enough to secure and manage the airship. 

Although the building construction crew originally proposed the plan, the proposal eventually fell through due
