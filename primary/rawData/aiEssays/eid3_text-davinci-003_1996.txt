In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the setting is an important factor in the cyclist's journey. The rough terrain is a key element that affects the cyclist's movement. The cyclist has to grapple with inclines and declines, obstacles, and narrow roads. Even the conditions of the roads, such as gravel and potholes, add to the difficulty of the ride.

The weather in the setting also has an impact on the cyclist. The cyclist has to adjust to the heat, wind, and rain. The cyclist experiences difficulty when the wind blows him off course and slows him down as he labors against the elements. The rain creates slippery surfaces, making it difficult to stay on the bike. Sun is also a factor, as the cyclist becomes tired from the direct heat and the effect it has on his movements.

The environment of the setting can also affect the cyclist. The cyclist must deal with animals, such as birds and dogs, that can cause the cyclist to swerve and lose control. The cyclist must also contend with other riders, who can interfere with the cyclist's pace through their slow speed or dangerous actions. The cyclist must be aware of the danger of other riders and any other environmental objects
