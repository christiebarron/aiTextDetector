I was in line at the grocery store and the cashier was having trouble with the register. I saw the customer before me clearly becoming agitated and frustrated. As I pulled up to the register, I could feel the tension in the air. That's when I decided to just be patient. I remained calm and just let the cashier take her time. I smiled and told her that it was ok. After a few minutes, the register worked again and the line began to move. Seeing the relief on the customer's face made me glad I had chosen to be patient. I learned that day that patience can go a long way.
