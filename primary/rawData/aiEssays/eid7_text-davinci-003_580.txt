I was recently on a long flight from India to Canada and the person seated beside me was a young man who instantly struck me with his patience. During the flight, the airline staff were having some trouble making sure the meal service ran smoothly and the cabin was quite noisy. Despite this, the young man remained calm and understanding throughout the whole flight. He even struck up a conversation with me to pass the time.

He showed me photos of his family in India and told me about his hometown. He spoke about his plans for the future, and his hopes for his future children. His peaceful demeanor was truly inspiring and reminded me to stay calm despite the commotion. 

When we landed, he thanked me for the conversation and spoke with appreciation for the patience the airline staff had shown as well. He said that even though he was slightly frustrated with the delays, he was also grateful for the opportunity for us to talk.

I walked away from the experience feeling grateful to have had the chance to meet such a patient person and I strive to be equally understanding and resilient, even in difficult circumstances.
