When I was a kid, I had a very close friend named Joe. We were best friends since we were in kindergarden, and we spent most of our time together. 

One day, when we were both eleven, we decided to play a prank on Joe's dad. Joe had a lawn mower and he asked me to help him start it. We got it running and pushed it to the end of the driveway, which was right in front of Joe's dad's bedroom window. We tried to start it and just as Joe's dad stepped out of his bedroom, we revved it up as loud as we could, causing his dad to jump! 

We were both so scared and we were sure we were in a lot of trouble, but when his dad turned around, we were both surprised to see him laughing. He asked who was responsible for the prank, and Joe proudly stepped forward. His dad gave both of us a big hug and said it was the best prank he had ever seen. 

We both laughed so hard - we couldn't stop! Joe's dad was awesome, and that day has always been one of my favorite memories. Ever since then, all three of us have shared a special bond built on laughter and mischief.
