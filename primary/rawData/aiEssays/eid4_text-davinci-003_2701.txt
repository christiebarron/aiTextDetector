Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” suggests that the reader take a life lesson from a humble flower. It relates a story of resilience in a time of great struggle while also conveying a message of hope and positivity in the face of adversity. By ending the poem with the reflection of “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” the author is encouraging us to take heart; when the bitterness of winter is over, and the conditions for life to continue and flourish return again, then we can take the same test and pass it.

This reflects the idea of striving against odds and making the best of a bad situation. In the face of difficulty and challenge, there is still the chance to find joy and hope- illustrated by the survival of the hibiscus flower despite the winter season. We as humans can be inspired by this resilience; while winter may bring hardship, we can still find strength and positivity even in the darkest of times. 

This is perhaps the greatest lesson to be taken away from the poem: the need to keep on going no matter what the circumstances. The hibiscus serves as an inspiring example of patience and perseverance; it does not give up even when it seems all is lost and waiting for the winter to pass before trying again is sometimes necessary. In tackling the obstacles and tests we face, keeping our eyes on the brighter days of spring can help us face the struggles we must endure in the mean time.
