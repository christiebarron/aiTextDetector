Dear Editor, 

The use of computers in our society today has become an integral part of the everyday lives of many people. From young children to senior citizens, just about everyone has some form of access to computers or electronic devices. However, there are mixed opinions as to the effects these devices have on people, and I wanted to take the time to state my opinion and persuade your readers to agree with me. 

Yes, it is true that computers and electronic devices have largely had a positive effect on our lives. It has opened up opportunities for education, entertainment, communication, job opportunities, healthcare, and more. But along with the positives sometimes comes the potential for the negatives.

Too much time spent in front of the computer or electronic device can affect people in a variety of ways, such as eyesight problems (due to the blue light), a lack of physical exercise (leading to obesity, heart disease, and more), and an increase in stress.

Ultimately, it is important to practice safe and healthy habits while using these devices. We should strive to create a balance between digital life and physical life. Setting time limits, getting the proper amounts of physical exercise, developing healthy relationships, getting the right amount of rest, and spending time outdoors is crucial in creating this balance.

I believe it is important to point out the possible negatives associated with computers and devices, while still emphasizing the many positives these devices bring to us.

Sincerely
