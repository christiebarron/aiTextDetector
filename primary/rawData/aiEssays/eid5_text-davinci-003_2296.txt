The mood throughout the book is one of reflection and nostalgia, as Rodriguez takes us on a journey through his childhood growing up in a Cuban-American family in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The story begins with Rodriguez’s early experiences in Jersey City and his introduction to the English language and what it meant to be a Cuban boy in America.
