The building of the Empire State Building was a monumental undertaking for its time, and the notion of allowing dirigibles to dock with the skyscraper seemed impossible. When plans for the Empire State Buildingâ€™s mooring mast were unveiled in 1929, the idea of safely docking massive airships on the mast raised concerns.

One of the immediate obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was creating a mast that could withstand the forces placed upon it. To survive the immense wind pressures, the mast had to be built far beyond the standards of the time, and its total height, when combined with the tower, had to equal 1,460 feet. When this height was coupled with the fact the mast was to be built at the highest point of the building, engineers faced a long list of concerns.

Another challenge was making sure the mooring mast was strong enough to safely hold a dirigible while on the ground. Since airships were so much larger than anything else every moored to a building, the docking system had to be extremely secure. It was determined that two mooring lines were necessary to stabilize the ship during docking, and due to the limitations of the time, the lines would be connected by steel cable, instead of the traditional rope. The cables were also fitted with a series of clamps and sawtooth-entered rings to help keep the airships in place while they were on the ground.

The builders of the Empire State Building also had to ensure the safety of passengers and bystanders on the ground. Winds and turbulence created by the airships had to be taken into consideration
