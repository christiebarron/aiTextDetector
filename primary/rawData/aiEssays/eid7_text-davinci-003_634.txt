I remember one time when I was still working in an office that was incredibly busy. Everyone was trying to do their best but the stress levels in the building were through the roof. Everyone was frustrated and angry and taking it out on each other.

That day, I was trying to get some important documents taken care of and I was having trouble getting it done. My boss looked over, saw me struggling and could sense my frustration. Instead of reprimanding me, she calmly asked if I needed help. She then proceeded to walk me through the steps one by one and I was able to get the task done in the end.

In that moment, I was so thankful for her patience and understanding. She could've easily gotten mad and lashed out at me, but instead, she chose to stay patient and help me figure out what I was doing wrong. That kind of understanding is something I appreciate and aspire to.
