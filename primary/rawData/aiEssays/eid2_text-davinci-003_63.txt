It is a common belief that books and other materials in libraries should not be censored. While I agree that libraries should not ban books, I believe that certain materials that are deemed offensive should not be readily accessible in public libraries.

The role of public libraries is to provide their patrons with access to material that best serves the community, and materials that lack literary merit or are deemed offensive should not be readily available for viewing. Books, music, movies, and magazines that promote hateful messages or stir up controversy should not be placed on library shelves unmonitored. For example, books that contain large amounts of profanity lack literary merit and can have serious harmful psychological effects on young readers. Moreover, materials that contain sexually explicit content should not be displayed or accessed in public libraries. Such explicit materials can make patrons of all ages, but in particular minors, feel uncomfortable and may even be illegal in certain areas.

In conclusion, libraries should not censor books and other materials by banning them altogether, as this violates our right to the freedom of information. However, there are certain types of materials that should not be readily available in public libraries due to their offensive content; such material should only be available upon request with permission from a guardian or librarian. This approach would not completely exclude these materials from libraries, but it would protect our communities from materials that could have unintended consequences.
