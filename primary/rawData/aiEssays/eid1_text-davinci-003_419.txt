Dear [Editor],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Before computers, our lives were lacking speed, simplicity, and access to information. Now, we can connect to anyone in the world in seconds, have projects completed in hours thanks to automation, and find answers to almost any question almost immediately.

From a personal perspective, computers have enhanced my efficiency. As a college student, I have come to rely on my personal computers and digital devices to complete my assignments and research. With the speed and convenience of the internet, I can access thousands of opportunities with just a few clicks.

Investment in computer technology has also been beneficial to businesses. Automation has allowed businesses to increase productivity and reduce workforce costs. In addition, computer analysis provides valuable data for making better-informed decisions and understanding the needs of customers.

Despite these benefits, some people view computers with negative connotations. They believe technology alienates us from each other, increases social divisions, and makes us more dependent on computers. While these effects should not be underestimated, I believe that when used judiciously, computers can be a powerful tool to spread knowledge, foster innovation, and create a better connected world.

At the end of the day, computers have changed our lives for the better in many ways and should be embraced as the valuable asset they are.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
