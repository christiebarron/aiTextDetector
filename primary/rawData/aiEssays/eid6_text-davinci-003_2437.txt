The construction of the Empire State Building in 1930-1931 presented many obstacles to builders of the day, not least of which was the difficulty of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. At the time, the idea of a giant airship docking to an even taller building was so novel that many of the engineering challenges had to be worked out as the building was being constructed. 

The plans for the Empire State Building, from the beginning, included an attentuated mast set above the hundreth floor and designed to be used as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This made the completed building the first mooring tower to be built since the Eiffel Tower in France, a century ago. Unfortunately, building the mast proved difficult, if not impossible. The mast was to be slim and quickly became mired in delays as the engineers considered the stresses of sustaining a large and heavy airship, dynamic wind forces, heat transmission, and the additional strain of a spider web of guy wires attached to the tower. 

The mast was made of soft iron, a material chosen over aluminum due to its flexibility. This iron was built in two sections - the lower part being capped with a huge steel ball at the top. However, problems with the design arose when the engineers noticed that the ball casted shadows on the higher floors and hence a new design was made to retain the steel ball, but drop it down far enough to prevent the shadows. The whole process of redesign and re-construction was complicated and time consuming. 

Next, the engineers had to face the
