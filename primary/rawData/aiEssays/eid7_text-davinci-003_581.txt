I remember the time I was running late for the bus. I had a very important meeting that day and I was already running short on time. As I raced to the bus stop, I realized that I had left my wallet at home and had no money to board the bus. I was panicking and needless to say, very frustrated.

The bus driver saw I was distressed and kindly told me to get on the bus and he'd let me ride without having to pay. I was so thankful and expressed my gratitude. Then he proceeded to tell me his story. He had been late to work the day before and he told me how his boss had been understanding and waited for him, even though he was an hour late.

The bus driver was so appreciative of the patience and understanding his boss had shown him and wanted to pay it forward. I thanked him again, deeply touched by his story and his kindness. I went on to my meeting feeling humbled by the bus driver's patience and care.
