Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a reflective look at the feelings and values that have influenced his life and creative journey. From the very beginning of the memoir, Rodriguez establishes a somber mood as he recounts his difficult upbringing and strained relationship with his father. By writing about his childhood home, Rodriguez shows what it was to be a young boy struggling with the pain brought on by his father’s cruelty and the harsh words said by his father and stepmother. He beautifully weaves together stories of his daily life in his childhood home with stirring dialogue from his mother and reflections of his own experiences.

Through this melancholic mood, Rodriguez emphasizes the importance of family and loved ones in his life. Whether it’s his father’s powerful words that encourage him to push forward and never give up, or his mother’s calming presence and care, Rodriguez evokes an appreciation for the moments that have shaped him in the present moment. The most powerful moments are the reflections of his mother, who he both idolizes and loves. Her understanding of him and the world around him gives Rodriguez a renewed faith in humanity and, in a sense, offers him a solace to his struggles.

The melancholic, yet serene mood of Rodriguez’s memoir culminates in awe at the power of his familial relationships, from which innumerable lessons can be learned. Through Rodriguez’s words, one gains a greater appreciation for the significance of family, resolution, and legacy, regardless of the hardships one must endure to reach it. From Home pushes
