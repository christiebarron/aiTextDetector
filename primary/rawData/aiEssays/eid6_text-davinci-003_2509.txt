The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic buildings in the world, and its beautiful art deco architecture was considered a marvel in its day. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced an interesting challenge when considering the introduction of dirigible docking. Dirigibles, or airships, were a relatively new form of transportation that could transport large amounts of cargo, so it was of great interest to the builders of the Empire State Building to create a docking area for them. This would provide an impressive method of transport between New York City and other places and benefit both the economy of the city and the building itself.

However, the construction of the Empire State Building posed many hurdles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first challenge was engineering. The enormous height of the building made it difficult to create a landing area, as the air was so thin at the upper heights. Additionally, due to the wind conditions, the area must have been sheltered to keep the airships steady while docking. To address this, the builders had to create a crane-like mast that stood 262-feet high and had a structure to serve as a shelter in high winds.

The second challenge was safety. Since dirigibles were a new form of transportation, the builders had to make sure the mooring mast was secure and the airships would not crash into the building. To do this, the builders implemented a braking system connected to the mast that would automatically apply the brakes to the balloon's gondola if the wind started to become too strong. This system was tested on the 202-foot-long USS Shenando
