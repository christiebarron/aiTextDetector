The Empire State Building is one of New York City’s most iconic structures, but many don’t know it was designed to accommodate the docking of dirigibles, also known as airships. Unfortunately, a number of challenges prevented the practical operation of a docking mooring mast from the early days of its construction. 

The release of Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book The Mooring Mast shed light on some of the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building had to consider when forming the plans for the mooring mast. One such obstacle was that many of the earth-bound tenants of the building were not aware of the mooring mast’s purpose and were opposed to its construction. Other tenants were eager to have the mooring mast, and support from some city leaders was obtained, allowing the plans to move forward. 

Given the 1930s technology, a major engineering challenge came from the sheer scale of the project. Dirigibles of the era were huge and awkwardly shaped, and a mooring mast had to be stiff enough to hold the ship steady in the event of gusts of wind. This meant that the mooring mast had to be exceptionally thick, which in turn meant that enormous amounts of steel and concrete were necessary. To make matters worse, the mast had to be taller than the surrounding buildings, and to weight evenly, it was made of four sections with three of them cantilevered into space. 

The completion of the mooring mast came too late, unfortunately. The popularity of airliner passengers and the Hind
