I recently went to the store to buy a few groceries. I waited in line for what seemed like an eternity while the cashier was having some difficulties with the computer. There were a few people in line behind me getting clearly frustrated, yet I kept my calm. 

After a few minutes, the cashier finally managed to get the system working again, and I was able to continue the check out process. It took some time, but I was patient and understanding of the situation. 

No matter how rushed I was, I tried to be kind, courteous, and mindful. I was also thankful that the cashier was knowledgeable enough to navigate the technical issues that arose, and I told them as much. 

In the end, my patience paid off, and I was able to finish my grocery shopping without any further disruptions.
