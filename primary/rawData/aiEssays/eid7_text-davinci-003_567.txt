I was traveling home for the Thanksgiving holiday and all I wanted to do was get home and see my family and friends. I was stuck in a terrible traffic jam, with cars not moving an inch. All around, people were honking their horns, frustrated and angry. Everyone seemed so tense and impatient.

I took deep breaths and told myself to be patient. I tried to take my mind off the traffic by chat with my friends and listening to music. After what felt like an eternity, the traffic finally began to ease up.

I was grateful that I had chosen to remain patient, even when it was so difficult. I knew that if I had acted as some of the more impatient drivers had, I wouldnâ€™t have been any closer to my destination.

My patience paid off and I was thankful that I had resisted the urge to lose my cool. Remaining calm allowed me to get home in time for my Thanksgiving dinner.
