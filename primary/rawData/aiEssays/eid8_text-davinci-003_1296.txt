I had been dating my boyfriend, John, for almost five months when I could tell something was off. We hadn't been quite as close lately, so I suggested that we take a walk together to the park near our apartment.

At the park, I was so tense I couldn't even make eye contact with him. I started pacing back and forth, trying to find the right words to express my feelings, when out of nowhere John burst into laughter. I was so taken aback that I stopped in my tracks, completely confused. He said, “I’m sorry, but the way you’re walking is so funny—it looks like you’re an old-timey robot about to break down!” 

My first instinct was to be embarrassed, but then I started to laugh too. All of the tension from the past few weeks melted away in that moment, and I realized how much I had missed my silly, playful side of John. We ended up sitting on a bench for hours, just talking and laughing about every silly thing we could think of. 

That day, I learned that sometimes all you need to reconnect with someone is a laugh.
