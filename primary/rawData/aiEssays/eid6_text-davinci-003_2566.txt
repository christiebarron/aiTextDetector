The Empire State Building, designed and built during the “roaring twenties” of the twentieth century, was a symbol of technological progress, also known as a skyscraper, that was intended to enable dirigibles to dock on top of the building. While the plans of the architects and engineers who designed the building included a mooring mast on the roof, their vision of the building as the ideal landing platform was not realized due to a variety of issues. 

In the book, The Mooring Mast, author Marcia Amidon Lüsted states that the height of the prospective balustrade surrounding the mast was higher than legally allowed. Additionally, the air traffic at the height of the building made it difficult to achieve the potential landing speed necessary for a safe approach. The possibility of damage to the dirigible due to the high winds and turbulence at the height of the Empire State Building was of particular concern. The difficulty and expense of constructing the mooring mast with respect to the required materials to withstand extreme high winds and the weight of a potential docked dirigible were also issues. 

The director of the Department of Commerce’s aeronautics branch, Captain Washington I. Chambers, and architect William Lamb, leader of the design team of the Empire State Building, had to make many modifications of their plans to existing safety regulations. Additional safety factors had to be taken into account, such as specific building and structural requirements, detailed mooring procedures, and operations regulations. 

The original plans had to be revised to reduce the height of the guard wall around the mooring
