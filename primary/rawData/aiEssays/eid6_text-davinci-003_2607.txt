In examining the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock, it is helpful to study the mooring mast used to secure the airships to the building. The mooring mast, built in 1931, was a complex apparatus at the time, consisting of an iron mast and a steel cable extending to the ground of the building. The mast was designed to anchor the dirigibles in high winds and allowed them to be safely secured at the rooftop in the process.

The main obstacle that builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome was the security of the mooring mast itself. The mast had to be of sufficient strength to hold the airship’s bulk. Thus, the mast was designed to stand seventy feet tall and have a steel cable extending from its peak to the ground. While the cable provided some tension so the dirigibles were held fast, the biggest concern was how to keep the cable from slipping off the mast. To address this issue, the creators of the mooring mast incorporated a hydraulically-operated chain to the base of the mast, with multiple loops and pulleys running along the cable. This allowed the dirigible to secure itself to the mooring mast, thereby striking the necessary balance between tension and security.

The next obstacle was figuring out how to maneuver a dirigible in the confined space of the rooftop of the Empire State Building. This issue was addressed through a measure of topographic engineering strategies. For example, the architects designed a “channel” from the building’s main observation deck to the
