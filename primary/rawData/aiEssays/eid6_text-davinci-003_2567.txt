The efforts to construct the Empire State Building began in 1929 and it was no small feat. The ambitious project sought to construct the world’s tallest building at the time, which included the addition of a mooring mast, so that dirigibles—essentially, large, lighter-than-air airships—could dock at the top of the skyscraper. This radical concept was met with numerous obstacles, which were discussed in ‘The Mooring Mast’, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The first obstacle was managing the aerodynamic forces of the dirigible itself. As the building went higher and higher, a “vortex of air” developed around it, which altered the direction of the airships and made it difficult for them to keep a stable course. The architects had to take this into consideration when designing the building to make sure there were enough landings for the airships to be able to dock.

Another obstacle was the need for a large 900-foot anchor cable to secure the dirigibles. The cable was a complex affair, consisting of several winches and levers that had to be operated in unison. This was a daunting task even with the help of a massive team of engineers and electricians. In the end, the cable was actually constructed in seven separate segments and installed onto the building’s façade.

In order to ensure the stability of the mooring mast and its passengers, the engineers also had to account for other environmental factors. Wind, air pressure, and even the Empire State Building’s peculiar shape
