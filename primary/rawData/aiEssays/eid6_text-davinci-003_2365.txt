The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The most significant obstacle was the presence of extreme wind currents when the building was constructed in 1930. These currents would have made it virtually impossible for dirigibles to safely moor at the building’s top. 

Despite the winds, William Lamb, the building’s lead architect, felt that it was possible for the dock to be built into the building’s steel framework. He envisioned a mooring mast, likened to a flagpole, that could be erected on top of the building for dirigibles to attach to.

However, the mooring mast presented a number of problems. The first was how to lift the heavy mast up to the building’s roof, which was 101 stories high. The existing steel framework of the building could not support the weight of a mast and specialized construction workers would have to be hired to make the necessary modifications. 

Furthermore, the platform that the tourists would disembark onto had to be strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible and its passengers. This platform had to be safely secured to the top of the building, and special safety procedures had to be put in place to ensure the passengers’ safety. 

The biggest challenge the builders faced was the sudden change in temperature. Building the mooring mast into the steel framework of the building would require ventilation, as hot air rises, and it would be necessary to change the air in the framework to ensure that the dirigibles would be stable as they docked.
