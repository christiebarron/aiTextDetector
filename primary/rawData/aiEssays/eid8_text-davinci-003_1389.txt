I was in college when I met John. He loved to laugh, I remember that clearly. He had a joie de vivre that was contagious, and he seemed to be able to find humor in everything.

I remember when I met him, he was walking around campus with a couple of classmates. They were discussing a course they'd taken together and trying to remember a particularly difficult moment. I chuckled, thinking back on my own struggles with a recent course, and John turned to me with a big grin on his face.

"I'm John," he said, and we shook hands. He had the kind of infectious laugh that made it impossible to not laugh with him.

Soon, we started spending more time together. His sense of humor was like a beacon. Everywhere we went, he was able to draw people in and make them smile, even during tough times. He always had a punchline or joke to lighten the mood.

We've been married now for over 8 years, and his laughter still brings a twinkle to my eye and a smile to my face. His laughter has connected us in a way that no other bond could and for that I'm incredibly grateful.
