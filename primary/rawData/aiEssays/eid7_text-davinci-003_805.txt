I was standing in line at the bank on a busy Saturday, trying not to sigh impatiently and tapping my foot in the process. The line had been steadily growing for the past half hour, and I was antsy to get my business taken care of so I could be on my way. 

The woman in front of me had a mountain of paperwork she was filling out, slowing down the entire process significantly. I felt the frustration bubbling to the surface as I heard customers around me groaning and muttering. 

But then, the woman in front of me turned around and smiled at me apologetically. I could tell she was embarrassed at holding up the line and she wanted to make it right. I took a deep breath, smiled back, and assured her it was ok — that she wasn’t the only one in line, and that it was all part of the process.

The woman thanked me and seemed to relax after that. She was patient and diligent with her paperwork, but her shoulders weren’t as tense anymore. 

In that moment, I realized there was so much more to be gained from being patient. Not only did we both have a better experience, but I learned the value of being understanding and tolerant even when I was growing tired and impatient.
