I remember it like it was yesterday. I had never felt so connected to someone until that moment. 

I had recently started dating this incredible guy and I had gone to his house for the first time. As soon as I stepped into his living room, I could feel our connection deepening. We were sitting on the couch, just chatting away about our favorite movies, when suddenly my phone vibrated with a message from my friend. After we rattled off an array of inside jokes, the both of us started to have an unstoppable case of the giggles. It felt like laughing together broke down any sort of wall between us and created a new level of connection.

Time seemed to stand still as we laughed and laughed until we both could barely breathe. When the laughter eventually stopped, I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I looked over at him and he was beaming. We both exchanged a knowing glance and in that moment, I felt like I could tell him anything and it would be okay. 

That moment of shared laughter not only brought us closer on an emotional level, but also showed me how much fun we could have together. We have been together ever since and nothing can replace the connection that came when we realized that laughter was a bridge between us.
