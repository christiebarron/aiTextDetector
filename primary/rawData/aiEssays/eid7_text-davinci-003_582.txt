I once had a customer who was extremely frustrated with me and kept snapping at me. She hadn't been informed about a refund policy, but unfortunately the policy was no longer in effect and couldn't be waived. It was a sticky situation, but I stayed patient with her. Despite her constant complaining and making sarcastic comments about the situation, I calmly explained the policy to her, took her information for a follow-up, and expressed genuine sympathy for her frustration. Eventually, she calmed down and thanked me for being understanding. It was a difficult situation, but keeping my patience paid off in the end.
