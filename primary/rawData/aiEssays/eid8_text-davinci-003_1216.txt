I remember the first time I ever shared an enjoyable moment of laughter with my friend Haru. We had been friends for over a year but it wasn't until a lighthearted moment occurred that I felt a real connection with her.

It was a hot summer afternoon and we were sitting around Haru's patio enjoying some ice cream. We started talking about our plans for the future and I told her jokingly that I wanted to be a dolphin trainer when I grew up. Haru, who had the most amazing laugh I had ever heard, couldn't help but burst out into fits of wonderful laughter. It was a contagious laughter that made me begin to laugh along with her. It was one of those moments when time seemed to stand still and all you could hear was laughter.

We had a moment of complete and utter joy as we laughed together and our bond only grew stronger in that moment. Even though we shared other enjoyable experiences, that moment of shared laughter still stays with me today.
