Dear [Newspaper],

I am writing this letter as a citizen of [your city], expressing my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. Computers are becoming increasingly pervasive in our lives, and we use them for nearly everything these days, from leisure activities to information sources.

On the one hand, computers have made our lives much simpler. We are now able to perform tasks quickly and accurately with the help of computers, save and organize files and data, and access information from all over the world. On top of that, computers have enabled us to form new relationships and strengthen existing ones through social media and messaging apps.

On the other hand, computers also have some negative effects. Studies have suggested that people are becoming more sedentary and inactive as they spend most of their time staring at screens instead of doing physical activities. Additionally, computers can be addicting and play an integral role in the advent of cyberbullying and online harassment.

Overall, computers have altered our lives in a number of ways, both positive and negative. We should recognize the potential effects of computers and maintain a level head when it comes to using them. As citizens, we should take a proactive stance in taking necessary precautions to protect ourselves and our loved ones from any potential harm that comes from using computers.

Sincerely,

[Name]
