I was out to dinner with a good friend of mine for her birthday. We had made plans to go watch a show at a comedy club that night, but before that, we wanted to grab a bite to eat. 

We were having a great time talking about all of the exciting things which had happened since we last saw each other, but we were also having trouble deciding what to order from the menu. After much deliberation, my friend finally decided to order the most absurdly large steak the restaurant had, with a side of french fries, while I decided to order the risotto. 

We toasted with our drinks, and began to eat. I took a bite of my risotto, and as soon as it hit my tongue I couldn't help but groan as I started to laugh. It was the most delicious thing I had ever tasted! My friend stopped mid-bite, immediately cracking up, and said "are you okay?" 

We both broke out into a fit of uncontrollable laughter, and quickly began sharing the risotto. It definitely was too much for both of us to eat and we were so glad that we had decided to share. Even now, I find myself smiling when I think back on the risotto incident. That night was such a great reminder of why laughter is so important in any relationship.
