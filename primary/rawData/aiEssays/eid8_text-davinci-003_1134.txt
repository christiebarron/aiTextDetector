I was on my way to visit an old friend of mine that I hadn’t seen in years. I was feeling a bit anxious, not knowing what to expect when I arrived there. I had parked my car and was about to get out when I heard a distant yet familiar laughter coming from down the street. I remembered that specific laughter from my childhood days, it was my friend.

I peered out from my window to see him standing in front of his house with a big smile on his face, still laughing with joy. His infectious laughter made me smile, and I couldn’t help but join in. I stepped out of my car, walked right up to him, and gave him a big hug. We caught up on old times, laughed at our silly childhood memories and shared a few good stories. 

It felt like no time had passed since we had last seen each other, and our shared laughter made us both feel at ease and reconnect. I had gone there feeling nervous but as I left, I was filled with warmth and happiness. Laughter may be a short distance, but it can bridge many years apart.
