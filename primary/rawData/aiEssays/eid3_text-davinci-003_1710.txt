The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski plays an important part in how the cyclist experiences the challenging ride. The setting affects the cyclist from the beginning of the story, as the cyclist is warned by a sign that "Rough Road Ahead". The cyclist is already prepared for a difficult journey.

The road itself is another key feature of the setting. It is described as long and winding, with loose rocks and sharp tips that could easily damage a bicycle or cause an accident. What's more, the road is surrounded by deep ravines, making the possibility of being stranded even more daunting. This challenging terrain adds to the cyclist's awareness of the difficulties they will likely face during their journey.

The severity and difficulty of the cyclist's journey is emphasized by the changing weather conditions. As the cyclist progresses, the climate becomes increasingly cold and wet. This colder, wetter air makes it harder for the cyclist to keep their balance and gives them an added difficulty to overcome.

Finally, the terrain is further complicated by the fact that the cyclist is cycling without sunglasses. The cyclist is unable to see the road in front of them, making it even more difficult to navigate the obstacles in their path.
