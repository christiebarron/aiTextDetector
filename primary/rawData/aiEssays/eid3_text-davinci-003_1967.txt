In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead”, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in his journey. The first way that these features can be seen is in the type of road that he sets off on– a gravel road which is narrow, winding, and unfamiliar to him. This type of road is more dangerous due to its seemingly unpredictable terrain, as it is difficult to anticipate what will be around each corner. The cyclist must also be mindful of any natural obstacles, such as tree roots, sharp stones, and mud, that could potentially cause a crash or injury. 

The cyclist is also affected by the time lapse in “Rough Road Ahead”. The morning sun is just beginning to warm the day as he sets out, but as time passes it slowly heats up and then, in the late afternoon, begins to cool down again. This temperature change can create dehydration and fatigue, leaving the cyclist more vulnerable to injuries should he take a spill. 

The landscape of the setting has a huge effect on the cyclist as well. From the windy, isolated roads to the vast, open fields and hills, the cyclist’s journey is constantly changing.
