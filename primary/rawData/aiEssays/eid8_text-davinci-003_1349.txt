I was out with a group of friends the other night, and it was great fun. Everyone was catching up on different stories about their respective lives, swapping jokes, and generally being silly. In the midst of all the fun and games, though, I noticed something interesting—my best friend was noticeably quiet. Despite our attempts to make her laugh, she just sat there, looking a bit glum.

I decided to take it upon myself to get my friend out of her funk, and offered her some of the food that was being shared around the table. Still, that only drew a small smile to her lips. 

Finally, I resorted to a bit of a cheesy stand-up routine—I started to do jokes and impressions, making crazy faces and other crazy antics. After a few moments, I finally got her to join in the laughter.

Once her laughter started, it was infectious—everyone at the table was laughing and applauding, and it lifted the mood immensely. I was so happy to see my friend smiling and that I’d had a hand in making her laugh. It was something I will always treasure, and reminds me of the power of laughter and camaraderie.
