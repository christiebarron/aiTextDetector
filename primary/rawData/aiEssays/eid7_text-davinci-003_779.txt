I was at the store looking for shoes when I spotted a pair that I really liked. I tried them on and they felt great, but when I looked at the price tag, I realized they were outside my budget. Even though I was disappointed and frustrated, I stayed patient. I thanked the store clerk and even asked her to check if there was any kind of sale, but unfortunately, there wasn’t any.

Still, I tried to remain patient and chose to walk away instead of getting mad or complaining. I looked around the store for a little bit longer, realizing that even if I wasn’t going to buy the shoes I had wanted, I could find something else that would work just as well. And sure enough, I was able to find a great pair of shoes that looked similar and cost a lot less.

Being patient paid off in the end, and I was glad that I didn’t get too upset when I realized the first pair of shoes I liked were outside my budget.
