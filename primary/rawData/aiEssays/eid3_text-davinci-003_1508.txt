The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s poem 'Rough Road Ahead' is crucial to understanding the cyclist’s experience and feelings. This particular setting depicts a rainy day, with a grey sky and wet roads that are slick with mud. The cyclist is alone, pedaling compared to the movement of fast-moving vehicles in the distance. 

The dismal weather in the poem creates an oppressive and isolated atmosphere that aptly reflects the cyclist’s state of mind. The rain, wind, and mud increase the difficulty of the task, symbolizing the hardship and struggle associated with the cyclist’s journey. This difficult road ahead is further emphasized by the “washboard” nature of the road, a literary technique employed by Kurmaski to emphasize the grueling challenge of the cyclist’s journey. 

Paired with the wet road and oppressive storm, the cyclist faces tremendous loneliness as they face the road ahead. The absence of other cyclists, friends, or family further accentuates the difficulty of the task. There is a lack of support structure, and no encouragement as the cyclist faces the struggles of the “washboard” road ahead.
