I remember one time when I was shopping in the grocery store, picking up all the items that I needed for the week, when I had an encounter with a customer in front of me who was having trouble getting their items to scan. The cashier was doing everything that he possibly could, but nothing was working. I could see the frustration starting to build in the customer's face. That’s when I decided to step in. I leaned over and offered some help. I calmly suggested that the customer try and rearrange their items and see if that would help. Sure enough, that seemed to do the trick. After a few more minutes, the customer was able to get through the checkout and they thanked me with a genuine smile. 

Throughout the entire ordeal, I was calm, collected, and patient. I didn’t allow myself to get frustrated and upset with the situation, instead, I remained composed and confident. I learned that day, that sometimes the best thing you can do is to help a fellow out, in a calm and respectful manner.
