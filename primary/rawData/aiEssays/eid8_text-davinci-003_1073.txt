I was walking down the street, picking up my groceries, when I noticed an elderly couple talking and laughing together in front of their house. It immediately put a smile on my face and made me laugh too, without even meaning to. 

I didn't want to intrude, but I couldn't help but laugh with them and it felt so wonderful. I realized how much joy they were bringing to everyone in the neighbourhood. I could feel it, the warmth radiating from the two of them. 

I soon found out their story. They had been married for fifty years and this was their daily tradition â€“ strolling out together in the sun, having a cup of coffee while they laughed and joked with each other. It was a beautiful sight, not just to me but to everyone who passed them by. The moment was deeply special and it made me remember the power of laughter.

It's incredible how one simple emotion can bridge a distance between two people so quickly. Laughter makes us feel closer to each other and I am grateful for that glimpse into the joy of their friendship. It was greater than any material thing I had picked up that day.
