The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is masterfully crafted to provide closure on the symbolism of the story. The hibiscus, a tropical flower originating from the Caribbean, is planted “in a corner of the garden, protected from the snow.” Throughout the story, the hibiscus serves as a metaphor for the main character’s inner strength and longing for her home in the Caribbean, which is represented by the warm and fragrant breeze of a distant island.

The protagonist’s struggles with the extreme cold of winter, the snow, and the looming specter of a test that she fears to take serves to emphasize her longing to return to a place she knows and loves. In the end of the story, the protagonist makes a symbolic commitment to persevere: “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”

This end-of-story declaration is significant on multiple levels. Symbolically, it ties the protagonist’s journey of self-discovery and exploration of identity to the fragrant hibiscus flower. It is a commitment to her future self, a sign of hope that she can eventually return to a place she knows and loves – and to take the test she has been dreading. It is a demonstration of her resilience and determination to face her fears and move forward.

Ultimately, Winter Hibiscus is a story of resilience and determination in the face of difficult times. Through
