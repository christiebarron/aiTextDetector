The ending of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho serves as a hopeful reminder of the power of resilience in spite of upheaval. The narrator, a young girl living through turmoil, is facing a difficult history test. In a desperate attempt to avoid failure, she turns to a beautiful hibiscus outside her window and takes comfort in the knowledge that one day, it will bloom again when the snows have melted and the geese have returned. 

The symbolism of the hibiscus stirring her to keep trying despite her difficult circumstances is a reflection of the strength and persistence of the human spirit. Life is often difficult and unpredictable, but there is always the anticipation and optimism of better things to come whenever the sun rises after a cold night. The hibiscus serves as a reminder to the girl that, just like the flower, she can drain and start again each day, no matter how challenging the current situation is.

The theme of resilience and hope culminates in the moment when the girl decides to take the test again in the spring. She is looking forward to the day when “this hibiscus is budding”, when her determination and perseverance will be rewarded. In a way, the girl has taken strength from the flower and is displaying admirable courage in the face of adversity. By coming full circle, the story closes on an optimistic note and the message that we all have the capacity to rise from the ashes and hope for a brighter future.
