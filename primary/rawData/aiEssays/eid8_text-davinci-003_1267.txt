I remember it vividly, the moment I shared with my husband - a moment of pure, unadulterated joy. 

We had been married for a while, but the memories of our early months together seem to preserve themselves in my mind. We had just recently moved into our new house, and while it was still definitely a work in progress, I was so happy to finally be living with the man I loved. 

That day, we were driving home from the store, when all of a sudden, my husband started snickering. I asked him a few times what was wrong but all he would do was laugh louder. Finally, he gestured to the song playing on the radio and I just had to laugh too. 

We hadn't done much in the way of unpacking, but that didn't stop us from singing and laughing together. No matter how bad of a day we were having, this silly, corny song had managed to light up our car like a Christmas tree.

We didn't even make it to our destination before we were both in tears, unable to control what seemed like two unstoppable forces. I felt a lightness in my chest and I just knew this was a moment that I wanted to keep forever.

My husband and I always joke that no matter how old we get, that silly song will never fail to make us laugh. It is always a reminder of the fun and wonderful memories we have shared. Laughter will forever and always remain a crucial part of our relationship.
