I was walking to the store one day to pick up some items, and I noticed that there was an old man slowly crossing the street. He was having difficulty, as it seemed like his legs were not moving at a normal pace. I could tell he was trying to hurry, so I decided to be patient and slow down to wait for him. 

I patiently waited as the old man took his time crossing the street, and when he reached the sidewalk, he turned to me, thanked me, and told me that he appreciates the gesture. He shared his story with me, telling me how he has been ill recently and he can barely walk.

As I listened to him, I felt a deep respect for how he was dealing with his situation. Despite his frailty, he was still so filled with life and gratitude. I was able to empathize with him as I had seen my grandparents experience the same struggles. The old man went on his way and I continued on to the store, grateful for the lesson of patience I had learned that day.
