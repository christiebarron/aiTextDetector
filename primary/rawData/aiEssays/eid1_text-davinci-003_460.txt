Dear Editor, 

Technology has transformed life as we know it. Computers - and the Internet - have had an ever-increasing influence on how people interact and carry out their daily activities. But as with most changes, this widespread growth has not been without its drawbacks.

Rather than making us more effective and efficient, computers often consume more of our time than we care to admit. People now stay plugged into the digital world long after the work day is done, leaving less time for personal and communal activities. As well, this levels of connection can harm our relationships, engagement in social activities, and adversely impact mental health.

The world would be smarter, healthier, and better off if people stepped away from computers more often. Purposefully taking time to unplug and experience the world around us can make all the difference in our well-being. We can even use technology to prompt us to disconnect – there are apps that limit our time online or feature reminders to take important breaks.

Let’s take charge of our relationship with computers before they take charge of us. Let’s all strive to unplug more and instead nurture our relationships with others, our environment, and ourselves. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
