I remember the day I met my best friend like it was yesterday. We were both sitting in the library studying for an upcoming test. I had glanced up from my book and saw this girl across the table from me with a huge smile on her face. I couldn't help but smile back. We made some small talk and then she started telling me a joke that she had overheard. Before I knew it, we were both in hysterics. We just couldn't control our laughter.

It seemed like hours before we calmed down. Once we did, we both just sat there smiling at each other. We knew from that moment that we'd be friends for life. From then on, we made it a point to laugh with each other whenever we could - itâ€™s still one of the best ways we bond. Whether we were reminiscing on funny moments or swapping jokes, so much of our friendship has been defined by laughter.
