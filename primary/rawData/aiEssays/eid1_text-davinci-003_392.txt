Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. As technology has progressed, it has become increasingly difficult to imagine our lives without computers. Young people especially, have grown up with the internet and digital media, a lifestyle heavily reliant on computers.

In some ways, this has been a positive impact, providing new and faster ways to communicate, work, shop, and interact with others. Distance learning, interactive games, and travel have all been revolutionized by computers.

However, it should not be underestimated how invasive technology can be in our lives, hindering human interaction and socialization. Heavy computer use can lead to an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, leading to numerous physical effects including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.

I believe that if the usage of technology is done responsibly, it can promote innovation and development, but if it is taken too far, it can cripple physical, social, and emotional development. I think it is essential to recognize the negative impacts computer usage can have and strive for balance in their application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
