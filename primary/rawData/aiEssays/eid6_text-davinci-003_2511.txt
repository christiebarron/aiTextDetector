In the 1930s, the idea of allowing dirigibles, or large airships, to dock at the Empire State Building in New York City was a revolutionary idea. The concept of the mooring mast, designed by Albert Moore, would potentially open up a whole new era of intercontinental air travel. In a perfect world, dirigibles would be able to dock atop the Empire State Building, but this ambitious goal was not without its hurdles and obstacles.

The first obstacle was the need for a mooring mast that could support the weight of a large airship. The mooring mast would be a tall metal tower that would have to support the weight of the dirigible and its crew. This tall tower would have to be designed in such a way that it could withstand the high wind speeds at the station, as well as possible turbulence the airship could experience. Moore's mooring mast design was able to achieve these requirements, albeit with some minor modifications.

The second obstacle was the fact that the mooring mast would be atop the tallest building in the world. This posed numerous safety concerns, as the mooring mast and its occupants were at the level of passenger and pedestrian traffic. To address this, Moore's original design had the mooring mast below the level of the building. However, this was met with resistance from the Empire State Building management, as the tower would obstruct the view of the building from the street level. To solve this, Moore had to engineer a mooring mast that was tall enough and could withstand the wind, but still fit in a small area
