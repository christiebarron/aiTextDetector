I was once faced with a situation that required patience. I was shopping at a department store when suddenly, their computer system went down. The store was filled with frustrated customers and employees. Instead of getting angry, I decided to remain calm and wait for the system to come back up. I did my best to not express my frustration to the employees and kept a positive attitude throughout. After about 15 minutes, the system came back on and the store resumed their normal operations. I was glad that I stayed patient instead of yelling, as patience is always the best way to handle uncomfortable situations.
