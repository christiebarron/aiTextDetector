I remember quite clearly the first time I laughed with my boyfriend. We had been friends for some time, often chatting about anything and everything, but for a number of reasons, we had yet to share a true moment of genuine laughter. We were in a long line for a movie and he spotted someone in the line wearing an outrageous costume and made a funny comment about it, and before I could stop myself, I started to chuckle. As the laughter grew, my reservations quickly melted away and before I knew it, we were both hysterically laughing.

It felt like such an incredible release, like I was able to finally let go of something I had been holding inside for a while. We looked at each other when the laughter finally subsided and suddenly, the atmosphere between us shifted—it was no longer awkward but something lighter, like we were connecting on a much deeper level.

Laughter has been a big part of our relationship since then. Whenever  one of us is having a bad day, all it takes is a funny story or joke to turn it around. We now recognize the importance of laughter in our interactions, and sometimes we don't even have to have anything funny to say for us to start laughing—it's become so natural for us.

I'm so grateful that I'm able to be myself, laugh and not be judged by the person I care about most. I'm thankful for the laughter that exists between us, because it is a reminder that it's okay to let go of the little things and just enjoy the moment.
