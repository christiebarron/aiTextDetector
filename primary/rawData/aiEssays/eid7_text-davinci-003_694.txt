It was a day like any other. I had grocery shopping to do and I was running late as usual. I was at the checkout line, waiting in line to pay for my grocery items when I noticed a younger couple in front of me. They were struggling to make ends meet, counting out their change and coins to pay for their purchases. Everyone else in the line was getting impatient, constantly looking at the clock and grumbling to each other about the delay.

I, however, was patient. I knew that judging them and getting angry would not help them in any way, and stepping up to pay for their groceries would not be the best solution. After counting out their coins and change, the couple eventually gathered enough money to pay for their purchase, but of course they owed more than they had expected. Everyone else started to grumble louder at that point, but I stayed quiet and understanding.

The couple asked the cashier if they could have a few items back so they could try to gather the remaining change. Again, everyone else in the line got angry and started saying rude things. I just stood in my place, calmly and patiently waiting for the couple to finish their purchasing ordeal. When they finally left the line, I could tell from the look in their eyes that they were very relieved and thankful for the kindness of strangers.

This experience really opened my eyes about the importance of being patient and understanding. I realized that often being patient is more important than being efficient, and that being kind and understanding goes a long way.
