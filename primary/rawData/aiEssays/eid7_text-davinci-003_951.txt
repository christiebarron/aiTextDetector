I remember a time when I was patient. I had spent a whole day shopping for my sister’s birthday present – trips to dozen stores, countless hours standing in line and endless conversations with store clerks. All I wanted was to buy her something special and make her happy. After hours of looking I finally stumbled upon the perfect item. In my excitement, I had forgotten to bring enough cash and my card was denied. I was overcome with frustration. I was so close yet so far. But I knew the store didn’t accept returns so I decided to wait and figure out how I could get the item.

I called a friend to ask if they could help me out, but they were away on a business trip and couldn’t. I was disappointed but determined not to give up. With nothing else to do, I decided to wait. I waited until the store closed and asked the owner if I could come back in the morning to buy the item. He was surprised but so graciously agreed and even let me leave the item at the store for safekeeping. I was thankful for his kindness. 

I’m glad I was able to maintain my patience in a situation like this. Most of the time impatience is natural, but it’s important to remember that in difficult situations, patience is essential.
