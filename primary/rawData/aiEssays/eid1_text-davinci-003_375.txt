Dear Editor,

I believe that computers have drastically affected the lives of people, in both good and bad ways. Computers have provided people with a world of potential, creating new opportunities for communication and creativity, as well as providing access to networks of knowledge and various resources. 

However, the technology comes with its own disadvantages. With the rise in computer usage, there has been an increase in digital addiction and a decrease in physical activity. The use of computers has led to a decrease in physical interaction with friends and family- both of which are important for human growth and development. People have also become more exposed to cyberbullying and vulnerable to data breaches.

In addition, the technology has created a fast-moving world, where we are constantly relying on machines to help us accomplish tasks. This has caused a decrease in productivity and creativity among those who use computers. Nowadays, people spend more time online than in the real world, and the potential ramifications of this are unknown. 

Regardless, computers will continue to have an integral role in our lives. It is therefore important to raise awareness surrounding their effects, and to make sure that we are taking full advantage of their potential while managing and mitigating the risks. 

Sincerely,

[Name]
