I was recently stuck in a long line at the grocery store. I was already feeling frustrated as I had been there for over an hour, and the line in front of me hadnâ€™t moved. I was about to erupt in anger, when I noticed the person in front of me was an elderly woman. She kept apologizing to the cashier for slowing down the line, but the cashier kept reassuring her that it was fine. To my surprise, I watched as the cashier and the other people in line were incredibly patient with her despite her slower pace. Seeing this, something inside me shifted, and I realized that I could choose to be patient as well. I smiled at the woman, and began to relax instead of becoming more frustrated. After a while, the line began to move a bit faster and soon enough I was able to check out. I felt grateful that I had been able to find patience in the situation despite my initial annoyance.
