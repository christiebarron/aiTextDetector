In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting directly affect the cyclist's journey. The setting is a winding mountain road, encompassed by a variety of trees, plants, and shrubberies. These natural features of the setting create a sense of brief shelter, as the cyclist is soon assaulted by the rocky terrain.

The fluctuating sun and rain occurrences of the mountainous setting make an already complicated journey even more difficult. The sudden changes in temperature between day and night are physically demanding for the cyclist, as he must adapt to the rapidly changing conditions with limited resources to make the journey easier. The small streams that crisscross the mountain roads adds a slippery, dangerous element to the ride.
