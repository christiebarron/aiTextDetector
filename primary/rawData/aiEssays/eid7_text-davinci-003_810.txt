I recently had the privilege of talking to my neighbor, Tom, who is 87 years old. Tom has been married to his wife for over 50 years and is a prime example of patience and understanding.

He spoke to me of a time when his wife was diagnosed with a condition and had to be in the hospital for nearly a month. Even though he was in agony with worry, he was strong for her, visiting her as often as he could and helping her get through her treatments without complaint.

He says that being able to stay patient and not just worry about himself was one of the hardest things he's ever done, but that it was worth it in the end. 

You could tell from the look in his eyes that this experience had shaped his view of patience, and how it's not just an abstract concept but something we can all draw from when faced with difficult times. He credited his wife's quick recovery to his ability to stay patient with her and all of the doctors involved in her treatment, even when it felt impossible.

Tom's story will stay with me for a long time. His view of patience was inspiring.
