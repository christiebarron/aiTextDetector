Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is an exquisite exploration of identity, family and home. Through a combination of recollected memories, photos, illustrations and reflections on his childhood, it's easy to feel the profound mood that was created. 

His narrative encourages readers to explore their own thoughts, journeys and dreams while connecting them to the one they hold most dear; home. By weaving together an array of colors and layers, Rodriguez strikes a delicate balance between examining his life while keeping a safe distance from it. As memories of his parents and siblings, as well as their Puerto Rican heritage, are revealed, a sense of nostalgia and familiarity is created. His words provide insight into the trials and tribulations of his life, while our imagination and nostalgia become a source of comfort and identity. 

Rodriguez’s illustrations are guides which transport readers to a place of joy, fear, and home. From the lively bright blues to the muted dark shades, these visuals create a spectrum that allows us to re-experience and appreciate our own family heritage. Even when his words become heavy, the stark contrast of his illustrations fill the gaps with a dreamlike presence that captivates us compelling us to "read between the lines" of identity and togetherness. 

From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives evokes an incredible sense of nostalgia for readers. It is a reminder of our shared familial struggles and the universal push for self-awareness and acceptance. Through its refined storytelling, this book creates a mood that is both honest and calculated.
