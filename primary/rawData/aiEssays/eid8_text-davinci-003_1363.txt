I remember the day I met my best friend like it was yesterday. We were in sixth grade, in our home room class, when the teacher asked everyone to introduce themselves. I felt so awkward and uneasy; every time I opened my mouth to speak, I stumbled over my words and felt my face flush with embarrassment.

But when it was my best friend's turn to introduce herself, she broke the awkwardness of the atmosphere with one sentence. She joked that she was the queen of the jungle, louder than a lion because it was her favorite thing to do - make people laugh!

At that moment, we locked eyes and cracked up. We couldn't stop laughing and the entire class joined in. When the teacher finally calmed us down, she asked us to take this newfound energy to the playground.

The rest of the day was just filled with laughter. We took turns trying to make each other laugh, and threw a combination of silly faces, jokes and stories at each other. We had no idea at the time, but it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

We still laugh together almost every day, and our bond is stronger because of it. We understand that laughter is a way of connecting with each other, and it's the shortest distance between two people.
