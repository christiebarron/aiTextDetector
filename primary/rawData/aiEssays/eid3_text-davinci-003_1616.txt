The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski is an essential element to the cyclist's story. The road is bumpy and winding, weaving through a thick, old-growth forest with tall trees, branches, and dense foliage providing a natural canopy of shade. This serves to heighten the climactic tension and anxiety of the cyclist, especially on unfamiliar roads. On top of that, the cyclist is pedaling up an incline, increasing the challenge and difficulty of the terrain.

The cyclist’s surroundings also contribute greatly to the story. The dense foliage creates a dense soundscape, which is both soothing and oppressive in turns.
