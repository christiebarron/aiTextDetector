I recently experienced a situation where I had to be patient. I was riding the bus home when an elderly woman got on. She was having difficulty moving her walker onto the bus and I rushed up to help her. As she worked her way to her seat, she dropped her purse and supplies all over the bus floor. Everyone on the bus was starting to get impatient, especially the bus driver. But, I stayed calm and collected. I helped her pick up her items and find a place to sit. She thanked me and this small act of kindness made me feel great. It may not have been the fastest process, but I was patient through out the entire situation and it was worth it.
