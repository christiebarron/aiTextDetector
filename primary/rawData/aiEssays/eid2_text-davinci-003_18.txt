Many people, especially library patrons and librarians, assume that censorship has no place in public institutions such as libraries. But this assumption is misguided. Libraries are, in fact, obligated to exercise certain forms of censorship in order to protect the public from materials that may be deemed offensive. 

On the one hand, censorship can stifle freedom of speech and the free flow of ideas. Ensuring that libraries offer diverse and balanced materials is essential to the creation of a vibrant and dynamic educational environment. But on the other hand, it is impossible to provide unrestricted access to all forms of information without taking into account potential harm to society at large. For example, materials that contain extreme violence or pornography may need to be removed from library shelves for the safety of library patrons, especially children. 

Itâ€™s also important to remember that libraries are accepting public funding, which means that they have a responsibility to the public to regulate and censor materials as needed. To censor in an appropriate, restrained way, librarians should apply a clear and consistent policy with specific guidelines and criteria. This is the only way to ensure that the library remains a safe, welcoming environment for everyone. 

Ultimately, libraries are not obligated to remove all materials that some people may find offensive. However, libraries must exercise wise censorship in order to maintain their professional and moral obligation to society. An appropriate balance of censorship and open access to materials is essential to the health and educational value of libraries everywhere.
