I remember it like it was yesterday, although it must have been at least seven years ago. I was in college and had been dating my boyfriend for about a year. We were out to dinner at a local restaurant and it was raining pretty hard. As we sat down, we noticed a couple in the booth next to us without an umbrella, having just arrived and with no way out of the downpour. We couldn't help but laugh at the comedy of the couple's situation, and soon they noticed us and also had to chuckle at their misfortune. 

We asked if they needed help, and after buying them an umbrella, we offered them a ride back to their apartment. We drove their car and followed them with my car. My boyfriend and I laughed all the way there, making jokes, and the other couple lightly smiled and tried to politely laugh along. When we finally arrived at their apartment, we all thanked each other and parted ways, making sure they had our number in case they needed any other help. 

Our laughs that day, both ours and despite the other couple's reluctance to join in, created a light connection between us, and we still talk about that night whenever we cross paths. It was a moment of connection through laughter, and I'm so glad for it.
