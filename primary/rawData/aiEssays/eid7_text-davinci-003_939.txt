I remember being in the grocery store one day, standing in a long line to check out. I saw the person at the register was having some difficulties with an item that someone had to return. The customer was getting visibly frustrated and started to raise their voice. Despite this, I remained patient and waited my turn. I looked around the store and noticed all of the other customers with an understanding that they were also in the same situation. 

Finally, after a few minutes, the problem at the register was resolved and the customer was satisfied. The person at the register thanked me for my patience and thanked the other customers as well. It was a great reminder of how being patient can go a long way. Empathy and understanding are important qualities, and it was an important lesson to remember.
