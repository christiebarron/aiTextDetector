One of the fondest memories I have is one night I was out with my friends. We decided to go to a comedy show and it was one of the best decisions we ever made. We were all in stitches throughout the entire performance, laughing so hard my stomach was aching by the end. 

Afterwards, we decided to head back to my place for a late snack. It was a chaotic mess, with my mother running around the kitchen and all of us arguing over who was going to sit where. It was an outright hilarious chaos and no matter how hard we tried, we couldn't evade the big laughs. 

Every once in a while, one of us would catch a glimpse of the other and we'd burst out in laughter again. It was almost as if laughter was a language that connected us all, allowing for much closer bonds between my friends and I. I remember that night like it was only yesterday and it's something that I value and appreciate to this day. Laughter will always have a special place in our hearts.
