 

It was a summer day, and I was spending the day with my best friend. We had been friends since we were kids, and every summer we still get together for a day of fun. 

We were out for a walk and came to a river, so naturally, we decided to stop and take a break. Sitting on the grass, we started telling stories and jokes. Her laughter was contagious and it made me laugh even harder. Soon, we were both in hysterics, to the point that tears were streaming down our faces. 

Eventually, the laughter calmed a bit, and we just sat there in peaceful, smiling silence. For a moment, all the worries and cares of the world were forgotten and it was just the two of us, enjoying the moment. 

It's been years since that day, but I still remember that feeling of perfect peace and closeness that laughter can bring. It reminded me how much our friendship really meant to me and connected us on a deeper level. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
