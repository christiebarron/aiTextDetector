Dear Editor,

I am writing to address the many effects computers have on people in todayâ€™s society. With the widespread use of technology and the prevalence of computers in our daily lives, many of us focus more on our screens than we do on actively engaging with others around us.

It is no surprise then, that computers have had both a positive and a negative impact on our lives. On the one hand, computers are essential tools for communications, work productivity and learning. They enable us to keep up with the latest news and trends, access an expansive wealth of knowledge, and easily connect with people around the world.

On the other hand, computers also can have a detrimental effect on our social lives and health. Constant computer use can lead to increased stress, strained eyesight, and physical inactivity. Additionally, staring at screens for long periods of time has been proven to negatively affect our mental health and interactions with peers.

For these reasons, it is important that we use computers in moderation and practice healthy habits while using them. We must find a balance between utilizing the positive aspects of technology and maintaining healthy relationships with others around us. Computers should not become a crutch - they should be a tool to help us realize our true potential.

Thank you for taking the time to hear my opinion.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
