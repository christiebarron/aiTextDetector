Censorship in libraries is a hotly debated topic, and one that often comes down to personal opinions and values. Individuals are divided on whether or not materials in libraries should be removed based on the fact they may be considered offensive.

Admittedly, those who favor censorship in libraries do have a valid point. Libraries house books, movies, music and magazines for all to enjoy; thus, potentially offensive material could be seen as inappropriate or even damaging in certain contexts. There is also evidence to suggest that extreme censorship can have a moralizing effect, encouraging tolerance and respect for others and their beliefs.

On the other hand, against censorship in libraries are those who believe it to be a form of oppressive control. It could be argued that limiting access to materials or ideas goes against the fundamental values of a free society. Furthermore, what one individual finds offensive, another may not. As such, making decisions of this kind on anyoneâ€™s behalf goes against the principal of freedom of speech.

An argument can also be made that libraries should remain strictly objective when transporting information. The role of libraries is to provide access to materials to the public, regardless of opinions or beliefs. In cases such as these, it could be said that libraries must be seen as neutral grounds and thus should not intervene in the decision-making process when it comes to which pieces of literature are deemed acceptable or not. 

Ultimately, it is important to respect the opinions of all parties. A middle ground should be found that focuses on encouraging critical thinking, acceptance of different ideas or beliefs and educating the public on the importance of tolerating differences.
