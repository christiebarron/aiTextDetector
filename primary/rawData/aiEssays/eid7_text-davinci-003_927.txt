I recently had to wait in line for an hour and a half in order to get a coveted ticket to a popular event. As I was standing in line, I could feel frustration beginning to boil up inside of me as time went on and the line moved so slowly. However, I remembered how badly I wanted the ticket, and the thought of not being patient stopped me from complaining.

Since the line wasn't going anywhere, I started talking to the people around me and inquired more about their story. I was surprised to find that many of them had waited hours beyond what I had, some even camping overnight just to try and get a ticket. This was shocking to me, yet also inspiring. Everyone in line was so resilient and determined, and I kept this in mind while keeping my calm and not complaining.

Finally, after an excruciatingly long wait, I reached the front of the line. When the clerk saw how patient I had been through the entire process, they actually gave me an extra ticket to reward my fortitude. 

I walked away content and proud that I had stayed patient and not complained. It had been difficult, but ultimately worth it.
