I remember the first time that I made my best friend laugh. We had met earlier in the same week, but it wasn't until we went to a movie that I told her an off the cuff joke that made her laugh out loud. The spontaneous outburst felt so genuine. 

We then started a regular habit of swapping jokes, funny stories, and occasionally doing a bit of banter. Whenever one of us would come up with a particularly good joke or hilarious memory, the other would respond with a huge, uncontrollable laugh. More often than not, that laughter would lead to more laughs and soon enough we'd be in a sort of cycle.

Laughter bonded us together that day and ever since then it has been a part of our relationship. Even when we find ourselves in moments of disagreement, such as debates over who to pick on fantasy football, these little jabs at each other that lighten the mood often lead to laughter and understanding.

I'm so thankful to have found a friend that I have such a genuine connection with, and I know our laughter is one of the main reasons we've been able to grow and sustain our friendship.
