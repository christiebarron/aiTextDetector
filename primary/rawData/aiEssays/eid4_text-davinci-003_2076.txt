The ending of Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” speaks to the power and beauty of nature and hope. Throughout the poem, Ho paints a vivid picture of a hibiscus that is able to not only remain vibrant and hopeful in the face of winter, but also to break through the snow, signaling the sure arrival of the warmth and growth of spring. 

Ho’s use of the hibiscus in conjunction with the imagery of winter and renewal is powerful. The imagery of the snows melting and the geese returning is symbolic of the changing of the seasons and the new life they can bring. This idea of new life is further illustrated through the metaphor of taking a test again. By ending the poem on this thought, Ho is suggesting that while the winter can bring turmoil and pain, we can find hope in the promise of nature’s calming cycles, and of new beginnings that come with each new season. 

The hibiscus, in this poem, is a symbol of resilience and hope in the face of difficulty. Its strength to continue to bloom in the midst of winter speaks to the power of hope, and how it has the ability to overcome all things, no matter how unbearable the winter may be. This is an idea that all of us have experienced, when, in the midst of feeling like the darkness and struggles will never end, we can find glimmers of hope on the horizon, signaling that better times are coming.
