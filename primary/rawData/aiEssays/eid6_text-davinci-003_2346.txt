The impressive Empire State Building in New York City has a long and fascinating history, and for a brief period, the plan was to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The ambitious idea of building the Empire State Building to accommodate the docking of airships was one that was not realized due to a variety of obstacles. This essay will explore the difficulties the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to facilitate the docking of dirigibles, as described by Marcia Amidon Lüsted in her work entitled “The Mooring Mast”. 

One of the biggest obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome was designing the building in such a way that a large dirigible could safely dock at the top without risk of damage to the tower or the airship itself. Designers went to great lengths to ensure the stability of the tower, and worked to create a system of guide wires and mooring hangers in order to allow a dirigible to be safely attached to the building once it had reached the designated docking area. 

Another factor that posed a great challenge to the builders was the fact that the airships could only dock at the building in optimal weather conditions. In order for a dirigible to dock safely, the winds had to be under 15 miles per hour and visibility had to be approximately five miles. This posed a significant problem as airships could not dock in windy or foggy conditions, rendering the facility useless in unfavorable weather. 

The cost of the Empire State Building was also a sizeable obstacle since building the structure to safely accommodate dirigibles was
