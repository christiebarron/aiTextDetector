I remember when my best friend and I were at lunch in high school. We were discussing the upcoming drama club production we were both in and the class project due later in the week. We had been discussing the finer details of our group's project for a few minutes when he finally said, "you know, we should just make the entire thing up!"

We both instantly erupted into laughter. We were both so desperate for a good grade, but realizing that it actually could just be an elaborate fib completely relieved the pressure. The laughter kept coming, and by the end of lunch we had worked out the plan. It was a great success, and everyone in class thought it was the funniest thing they had ever heard.

The laughter was such a powerful bond between us. We had already been good friends and the lighthearted moment of spontaneity brought us even closer together. Even to this day, when either of us brings up that moment, it elicits nothing but smiles and more laughter. 

We both know that it's the moments of laughter that make up our relationship, and I'm so thankful to have such a kind and caring friend who shares these wonderful memories with me.
