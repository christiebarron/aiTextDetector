Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact of computers on our day-to-day lives. As technology continues to become more and more prevalent in our society, it is essential that we take the time to examine the ramifications of our increasing reliance on computers.

At first blush, computers can seem like a seemingly beneficial addition to everyday life. After all, they provide convenience and often streamline certain tasks associated with work, school, and entertainment. On the other hand, the effects of computers on our lives can be far-reaching and insidious, leading to an over-reliance on technology and the loss of critical thinking skills.

At the most basic level, computers can serve as a time-drain, allowing individuals to spend hours upon hours on unimportant tasks and ultimately detract from more productive pursuits. Furthermore, computer use has been linked to a decreased capacity for problem-solving and critical thinking due to the ease with which solutions can be found via search engines.

The bottom line is that computers can play an important role in our lives, but we must exercise caution in our use of them. Our dependency on them should not be allowed to eclipse our basic faculties for problem-solving and understanding. Let us all take a mindful approach to our interactions with computers and ensure that we take the responsibility of critical thinking and analysis into our own hands. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
