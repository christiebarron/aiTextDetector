I remember the day vividly, when my friend and I experienced one of the most joyous moments together.

It was her birthday, and I had bought her a fun, silly prank gift. When she opened it, she was initially perplexed by what I had got her. But then we both cracked up in uncontrollable laughter as we saw the gift - it was a bucket full of offbeat items such as a banana, a toothbrush, a candle and a spring roll!

We just kept laughing, bouncing off each otherâ€™s energy, feelings and thoughts until our laughter became exhausting. During that moment, I felt a deep bond with her, and I felt like we had connected on an entirely new level.

We still laugh about this moment to this day. I think this was a defining moment in our friendship, as we were able to build trust and connect on a deep emotional level. Laughter became an integral part of our bond, forming a strong emotional link between us. 

To this day, laughter is so important in our relationship and it is truly the best gift I could have given her.
