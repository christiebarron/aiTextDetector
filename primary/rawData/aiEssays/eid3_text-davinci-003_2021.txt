The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski play a key role in the story, as they help to establish the intense physical difficulties the cyclist is up against. The majority of the story takes place in the Mojave Desert, the most inhospitable environment the cyclist has ever been in. The desert is noted for being extremely hot and dry, making the cyclist's task of cycling even more challenging. In addition to the intense heat, the terrain is characterized by harsh, rocky terrain, like the "canyons, buttes and dry riverbeds" that the cyclist has to traverse. The terrain is further described as full of "unforgiving curves and steep inclines" that make the cycling even more difficult.

Overall, Joe Kurmaski does an excellent job of conveying the hardship of the cyclistâ€™s journey. The landscape of the Mojave Desert makes the cyclist's task even harder due to the physical challenges, like the rock and steep hills, that accompany the extreme heat. He must not only try to keep going despite the immense physical strain, but also must stay focused on his ultimate goal. The setting of the story gives the reader an understanding of the troubles
