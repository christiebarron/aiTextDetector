I was teaching an elementary school class today and one of the kids was having trouble understanding the material. It was frustrating for him, and he was starting to get angry and frustrated. I could tell he was about to give up.

So, I stayed calm and let him figure it out for himself, without pressuring him. I gave him positive affirmations and told him it was ok to make mistakes. I asked him questions to help him focus his thoughts and encouraged him to keep trying.

It took a while, but eventually, he figured out the right answer and finished the assignment. I could tell he was proud of himself, and it was such a great feeling.

It was hard to stay patient and not get frustrated, but I'm glad I did. I got to see that pride in the student's eyes, which made the whole process worth it.
