It was a typical day at the office when my co-worker, Jane, asked me a very serious question. She was trying to figure out how to divide up a big work project. I paused for a moment, struggling to comprehend the complexity of the problem and then it hit me; the answer was so simple, I couldn't help but burst out laughing.

Jane immediately joined in with her own laughter, not sure of what was so funny. After our little laughing fit had died down, I explained my solution. She seemed relieved to have uncovered a simple solution and we both began laughing again.

That was the moment I knew that Jane and I were going to be great friends. From that day on, we could always figure out a way to laugh together no matter how stressful the situation. We'd laughed in meetings, during lunch, and even while on the phone with clients.

No matter how busy our day was, we could count on having a good laugh together. Those moments of laughter really bridged the gap between us and I feel like it was a big part of why our relationship was so strong.
