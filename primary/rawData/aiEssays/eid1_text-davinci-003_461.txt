Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects that computers have had on people over the years. As technology continues to evolve, computers have become indispensable in many areas of life, from education to entertainment. I believe computers have improved many aspects of life, but they can also be detrimental.

On one hand, computers can be beneficial when used effectively. People can now access a broad range of information, allowing them to broaden their knowledge and understand the world better. Additionally, they can take online classes, participate in virtual meetings, and even shop without ever leaving home. On the other hand, people can also spend too much time in front of their computer or mobile device. This can lead to excessive internet use, which in turn can cause sleep deprivation, depression, and other physical and mental health problems.

In conclusion, while computers have definitely improved peopleâ€™s quality of life, it is important to use them responsibly. Consequently, I call on readers of this newspaper to consider the effects that prolonged computer use can have and to strive for a balanced lifestyle.

Sincerely, 

[Name]
