The Empire State Building, a marvel of the modern world, was designed to accommodate the docking and landing of dirigibles, or airships, in its mast. The concept and plan were driven by subsequent president of the Empire State Building Corporation, Grover Whalen, and envisioned as a gateway between New York City and the rest of the world. Despite the ambition of this goal, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a great number of obstacles in their endeavor to execute the mooring mast.

One of the greatest obstacles, which remained the same throughout the design process, was the sheer size of the Empire State Building, which would make the mooring mast an encounter of unprecedented proportions. During that time, an unprecedented mooring mast of such a grand scale had never been built or attempted. This meant that the Empire State Building Corporation and engineers had to develop this mast not only through trial and error, but also intense engineering calculations and research. In addition, the unique physical terrain of the building’s location presented a challenge, as there were major tall buildings and wind currents around it, which would have to be taken into account. 

Another hindrance was the monetary cost of the construction. The original estimate for the Mooring Mast’s construction had been $4.5 million, an expense which the Empire State Building Corporation had to obtain approval for in order to ensure the cost of its installation. Aside from designing the mast and constructing it, the Empire State Building Corporation had to take into account the amount of financial upkeep that was necessary to continue the mooring’s operational
