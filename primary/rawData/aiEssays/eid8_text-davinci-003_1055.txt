When my husband and I were first married, we had a lot of fun just goofing off and making each other laugh. One night, we were in our bedroom getting ready for bed and I said something silly, as usual. He looked at me as if I was speaking an alien language.

But then, something strange and wondrous happened—he started laughing. His laughter was contagious and soon I was laughing with him. We hadn’t realized how much our relationship needed a moment of joy like this. I was so overwhelmed with emotion that I couldn’t help it—I started to cry. Those tears of laughter and shared joy were like a balm for everything we had been through since getting married. 

We both knew that laughter had the power to heal and make us feel closer than ever. It was a reminder that no matter what else was happening in our lives, we still had the ability to make each other laugh, and that was truly a powerful thing.
