In Joe Kurmaskiâ€™s short story, "Rough Road Ahead," the setting affects the cyclist in several ways. The setting of this story takes place in the Rocky Mountains; the rugged terrain makes it difficult for the protagonist, the cyclist, to traverse. The rocky, uneven terrain makes it difficult for the cyclist to keep up a steady pace. It is clear that the cyclist loves the challenge of the mountains, but the challenge is very real. The rocky terrain often requires a great effort from the cyclist in order to make it over the rocks and crevices. Furthermore, the cold and hostile weather of the Rockies can also be an obstacle for the cyclist. The wind howls through the rocky peaks and the temperature can drop very quickly, making it harder to keep a steady rhythm while cycling. 

The presence of wild animals such as elk and bears is another challenge the cyclist faces.
