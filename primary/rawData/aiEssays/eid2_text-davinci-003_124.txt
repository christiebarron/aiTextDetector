Censorship has long been a controversial issue in libraries, and the debate has only grown in recent years as people struggle to agree on what is age-appropriate and falls under the category of “offensive material.” While some might argue that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive, this would be an exercise in futility. 

First, censorship leads to a slippery slope of regulation that could eventually hamper intellectual exchange and restrict certain opinions, without just cause. To limit access to certain materials on the basis of taste or moral grounds is to infringe on the rights of others. Those wishing to access materials deemed “offensive” should have the right to do so if they so choose.

Furthermore, censorship is often only skin-deep, in that it fails to address the underlying issues of how materials came to be deemed offensive in the first place. Rather than restricting access to these materials, libraries should be used as a means of addressing these issues. For example, a library might offer workshops and public discussions in order to foster an open dialogue about topics that may be considered offensive. Such a practice is infinitely more beneficial than simply pulling certain materials off the shelves. 

Lastly, censorship is a form of censorship that can be harmful to the growth and improvement of a library, as it restricts its patrons from having access to a broad array of materials. By removing books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelves, libraries can impede their evolution.

For these reasons, censorship in libraries is ultimately a misguided practice. Rather
