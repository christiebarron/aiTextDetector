The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s "Rough Road Ahead" affect the cyclist significantly. In the story, the cyclist is riding down a narrow, winding road lined with tall birch trees. Even though it’s a familiar stretch of road, the cyclist cannot remember how many times they’ve been there before. The ambiguity in terms of how many times they’ve traversed the same path creates an uneasy mood, giving the cyclist an air of trepidation.

The dense birch trees further add to the feeling of uneasiness; the cyclist can’t help but feel that something is waiting for them in the trees. It gives the appearance of a protected road, but at the same time a sense of danger lurks somewhere just beyond the frame of vision. The cyclist never feels truly safe, even when the road curves and leads them back home.

The calmness of the environment is both a blessing and a curse for the cyclist, as the peace amplifies the ominous sensation that creeps up on them. The oscillation between familiarity and complete unfamiliarity creates a sense of dread; an unidentifiable fear that something sinister awaits just around the bend.
