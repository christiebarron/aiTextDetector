I had recently started a new job at a bustlingcompany and was feeling fairly optimistic. It was my first week and I was ready to go, but on my first day, it quickly became apparent that I was the most inexperienced person in the room. Everyone else in the office had been working together for years and naturally had a lot of trust and understanding amongst each other. 

I was determined to get the hang of things as quickly as possible, but there were moments that I felt completely overwhelmed. In those moments, my boss was incredibly patient with me. He could sense my discomfort and quickly made me feel at ease. He explained things in a way that was easy to understand, and offered me helpful guidance whenever I needed it.

Despite the psychological pressures of being the new, inexperienced person on the team, I was able to take a deep breath and focus on the tasks at hand. My boss was always patient with me and did his best to help me understand and learn as much as possible.

In the end, I was able to manage my way through the stress of the situation. With my bossâ€™s patience and guidance, I was able to grow confident with my assigned tasks and eventually found that I was able to contribute more and more as the days went by.
