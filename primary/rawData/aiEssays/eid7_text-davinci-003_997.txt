I remember a time I experienced patience while volunteering. I volunteered at a hunger relief center to provide meals to those who were in need. Unfortunately, the place was severely understaffed and I had to take on tasks that I was not very familiar with. This included operating a cashiering machine, of which I had zero prior experience. I was faced with a long line of people who were increasingly getting impatient.

I knew I was in over my head, but remained calm and collected, while taking my time to learn, understand and adjust to the situation. I was met with kind words from the regulars and responded in kind. I was eventually able to locate a manual and learned how to operate the machine quickly, much to the delight of the line of hungry people. Everyone thanked me for my patience and professionalism, which made me feel really proud.

Being patient in the moment had paid off and taught me a valuable lesson: with patience, even the most difficult of situations can be turned around.
