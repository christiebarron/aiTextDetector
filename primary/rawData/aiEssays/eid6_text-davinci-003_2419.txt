At the time of its construction, the Empire State Building was arguably the most impressive architectural feat of its era - having been built at an unprecedented speed, in an equally unprecedented 211 days. The crowning glory of this high-rise was the planned docking of dirigibles at a mast, precariously perched at the top of the structure. However, the ambitious plan to attach such a dangerous and volatile method of flight was met with numerous obstacles that had to be overcome in order for the docking mast to be successfully integrated.

The first issue was the height of the Empire State Building itself - although the lofty ambition of the Empire State Building was admirable, the sheer elevation of the structure meant that the winds at this height could potentially cause an entire dirigible to drift away, damaging or destroying the airship in the process. This risk was addressed early on in the design process, by fitting the mast with attachments capable of absorbing the strong air currents, thus keeping the ship securely in place.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article ‘The Mooring Mast’, it is stated that another issue with the daring endeavor of attaching a mooring mast to the Empire State Building was that the weight of the large ships could put a strain on the structure of the building itself. To prevent any further damage, engineers strengthened the foundations by reinforcing the building’s core, as well as the mooring-mast itself.

Despite the obstacles, the daring plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was successful. The mast was completed in just five months and two
