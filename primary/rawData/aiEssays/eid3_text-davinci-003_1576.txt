The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' have a significant impact on the cyclist's experience. The terrain is described as being rocky and hard, with shrubs that obstruct the path and create a challenge for the cyclist. This type of setting forces the cyclist to navigate a narrow, rough and winding route with obstacles, while also fighting strong winds that can push them off course.

The harshness of the terrain also adds physical and emotional strain on the cyclist. Physically, the cyclist has to use extra energy not only to make it up a steep hill, but also to stay balanced on the rough terrain. Emotionally, they must endure the mental challenge of pushing through exhaustion and fear of unknown obstacles.

The overall environment of the setting also affects the cyclist. With gusts of wind and low visibility due to the shrubs, the cyclist has to be constantly aware of their surroundings in order to remain safe and on track. Additionally, the cyclist feels the weight of being in the open with no one else around; this type of isolation in nature can cause uncertainty, adding another layer of complexity to their journey.

All of these features of the setting influence the cyclist's experience
