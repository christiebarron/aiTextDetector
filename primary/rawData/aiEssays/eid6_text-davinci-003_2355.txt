The Empire State Building was an ambitious project from its inception. A major feat of engineering and architecture at the time, the then tallest building in the world, was designed to be a feat of modern technology. One of the most significant innovations imagined for the Empire State Building was the ability to allow dirigibles to dock, thus making it one of the first “vertiports” in the world. Unfortunately, the ambitious vision of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had its fair share of obstacles. 

At the time, there were numerous issues related to public safety surrounding the idea of docking large dirigibles on a building. Such dirigibles were incredibly large and heavy, and there was no guarantee that their enormous weight would not cause the structure to collapse. Additionally, the windy environment atop the Empire State Building made for incredibly dangerous conditions for such vessels, posing an even greater risk of potential disaster. 

The technological advancements required in order to make the Empire State Building a vertical port capable of securely and reliably allowing dirigibles to dock were significant. The invention of the mooring mast claw, made possible by the ingenuity of Gregory Westerfield, was fundamental in making the Empire State Building a viable vertiport. The creation of the mooring mast claw made it possible to securely and reliably secure dirigible vessels to the building. 

The Empire State Building was also faced with a unique challenge when it came to accommodating the varying shapes of dirigibles at the time. Dirigibles operated by different aviation companies came in different shapes, sizes and weights. This
