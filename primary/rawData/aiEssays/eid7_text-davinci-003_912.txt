I once had a job where I worked as a cashier. It required a lot of patience and multi-tasking skills. One day I was working and I noticed that a customer had come in. Before he could approach the counter he got caught up in a conversation with another customer. He was asking her a variety of questions on a very complex topic and she was taking her time in answering them.

I could tell that this was going to take a while, but I was determined to stay positive and remain patient with the customer. I waited, without complaining or making any noise to disturb their conversation. I even made sure to give them plenty of space and stay out of their conversation. 

After about thirty minutes of waiting, the customer finally finished his conversation and came over to the cashier. Even though a lot of time had passed, I still managed to keep my composure and greet him with a smile. He was very understanding and thankful for my patience when I explained to him that I had been waiting for a while and he thanked me for my kindness.

This experience taught me that no matter what task is put before you, it is always important to show patience and remain understanding. It is an invaluable skill to have and one that can lead to more positive and productive outcomes for all involved.
