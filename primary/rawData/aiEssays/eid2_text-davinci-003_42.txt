Censorship in libraries has been a controversial topic for decades, and it can be difficult to draw the line between a library offering materials to suit the needs of its patrons and censorship of certain materials deemed inappropriate.

The primary purpose of a library is to provide its patrons with access to information. By offering materials such as books, music, movies and magazines, the library fulfills its main purpose of providing knowledge and entertainment to patrons. In this light, censorship of library materials is not necessary, as it restricts access to materials which may be informational or educational for certain patrons.

Additionally, censorship of library materials could lead to a slippery slope of what is deemed fit for patrons, and could lead to suppression of books, music, movies and magazines deemed controversial by library officials. Eventually, this could mean that patronsâ€™ access to important works of literature or unique perspectives would be hindered. 

Finally, giving the decision to censor library materials to library officials could lead to a form of discrimination and bias. For example, certain works of literature may be related to certain lifestyles, religions, or races and could be considered offensive. In this case, library officials must remain nonpartisan in their decisions of censorship and focus on maintaining their primary mission of providing patrons with access to information.

In conclusion, while it is important to provide a library environment which is welcoming and respectful to all patrons, censorship of library materials should not be employed. Rather, library officials should focus on upholding their mission of providing access to information, while educating patrons on the materials available.
