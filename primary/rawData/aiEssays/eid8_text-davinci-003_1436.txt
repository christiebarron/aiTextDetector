I've always been the kind of person to appreciate a good laugh. Whether it's cackling at a particularly silly TV show or just cracking up at whatever joke one of my friends comes up with.

So, when I started dating a new guy recently, I was more than a little excited to see how our sense of humour matched up. We'd go on dates that inevitably gave us lots of great opportunities to really have a good time, something I was super excited to explore.

One of the funniest experiences we shared was on our first date. We had just finished dinner and were walking back to his place. Suddenly, we both heard a mysterious sound coming from around the corner. Of course, our first instinct was to stop and figure out what was making the noise and, as we did, out popped a giant kangaroo!

My date and I couldn't even control ourselves; we broke out into uncontrollable laughter. We laughed for what felt like forever, until eventually, we had to stop and just stare at the kangaroo, which definitely wasn't amused. Even though the situation was completely ridiculous, it was a light-hearted moment that I will never forget. There's just something about shared laughter that gets you closer to someone else.
