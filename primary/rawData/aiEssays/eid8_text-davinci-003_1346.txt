I had been dating my boyfriend for two years now, and during this time we had had plenty of laughs together. We were at a party with close friends, when someone made a joke that made everyone laugh. As I looked over at my boyfriend, I saw that he was laughing, but not as much as the rest of us. It wasn’t like him to not join in on the fun. I went over and asked him what was wrong, but he assured me that he was fine. I decided to take a different approach and started to tickle him — something I knew would make him laugh. At first he resisted, but eventually I won, and soon he was laughing and screaming at the same time. All of a sudden, the entire room filled with laughter, and it felt wonderful. Everyone around us was happy, and the atmosphere filled with joy.

This moment was special to both my boyfriend and me. We realized that moment that laughter was a perfect way to connect with each other, and our bond has only grown stronger ever since.
