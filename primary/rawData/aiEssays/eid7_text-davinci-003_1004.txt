I was recently on an airplane to my long-awaited family vacation. We had a layover of about two hours in a city I had never been to. All I wanted to do was get to our vacation destination and get settled in before we started our sightseeing. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned. Our second flight was delayed twice, putting us off schedule by four hours. Despite the hassle and inconvenience, I remained patient throughout the whole process. 

I thanked the flight attendants and kept a smile on my face the whole time. I helped keep my family present and positive, reminding everyone that it would all be over soon. Rather than complain and get angry, we used the time as an opportunity to explore our connecting airport and learn more about the city we were in. By the time our flight finally arrived, we had enjoyed the experience and I was able to maintain my patience and not let the unexpected detour put a damper on our vacation plans.
