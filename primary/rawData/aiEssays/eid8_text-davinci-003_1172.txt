I was a young adult, still figuring out my way in the world. I had started a new job and was determined to make a good impression.

On my first day, I was particularly nervous, but a kind colleague quickly put me at ease. He started telling me stories about his own experiences in the business. One of the stories struck me as particularly funny and I couldn't help but laugh out loud. 

My colleague responded with an even funnier story, and before I knew it we were both in stitches, completely forgetting about the office around us. Suddenly, someone cleared their throat, reminding us that we had an audience. We looked around and everyone in the room was smiling, obviously happy to witness our evident connection.

That moment of laughter was the start of a wonderful relationship between myself and my colleague. We laughed with each other, learned together, and supported one another through all of the ups and downs. Every time life got too serious, we could always turn to each other and find joy through laughter.
