Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is becoming increasingly apparent, in our technological world, that computers have had a dramatic impact on our lives.

Those who use computers routinely, such as students in grade school, benefit from the valuable information made available and the multitude of activities researchable online. Computers are, therefore, undeniably essential in completing academics work, advancing the skills of future generations, and expanding our knowledge base.

On the other hand, extensive use of computers has drawbacks. Hours spent staring at screens can take their toll on our physical health, with resultant afflictions such as poor eyesight, potentially leading to stress or other psychological problems. Furthermore, computers take people away from physical activity, potentially leading to lower fitness levels.

In conclusion, computers are undeniably useful and beneficial, but they should not be overused. We should ensure that they are used as a tool in moderation, and that people still carve out quality social and physical activity time.

I hope that I have been able to persuade you, and your readers, to agree with my opinion.

Sincerely,

[Name]
