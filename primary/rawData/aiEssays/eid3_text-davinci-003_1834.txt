The setting of the poem "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski plays a crucial role in the experience of the cyclist that is being portrayed. It is a rural setting, somewhere outside of town with rolling hills and winding roads. The lack of civilization implies that it is a peaceful and empty place, giving the cyclist a sense of solitude and freedom. 

The landscape also has its challenges, however, with the rolling hills and winding roads requiring effort and energy to traverse. The cyclist must push themselves forward and work hard to overcome the obstacles of the terrain, which is echoed in the poem through the metre and rhyme of the lines. The challenge of climbing hills and navigating roads aids the cyclist in gaining a sense of physical and mental accomplishment over their environment while they progress.

The atmosphere of the settings is also important in the context of the poem. A feeling of quiet wilderness is pervasive, with the rider being able to hear the birds softly singing and feel the soft breeze in their face as they pedal. This promotes an atmosphere of tranquility and freedom, allowing the cyclist to take in their surroundings and enjoy the moment.
