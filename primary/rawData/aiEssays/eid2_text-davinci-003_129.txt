Censorship in libraries is a controversial issue. While it is understandable for some to want certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines to be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive, I strongly believe such a practice should be discouraged. 

Censorship limits our knowledge and understanding of the world. Libraries have a duty to provide patrons with an array of options when it comes to accessing information. Restricting certain materials deprives individuals of the educational, social, and emotional benefits they can receive by exploring different perspectives through books, music, movies, and magazines. It can also stifle creativity, since artists often draw inspiration from diverse sources. 

In some cases, censorship can lead to a slippery slope where material can be altered or banned because someone finds it to be objectionable. Not only can this be used to suppress unpopular opinions, but it can also inhibit the free flow of ideas and open dialogue. Furthermore, censoring certain materials can make it more difficult for people to access the information they need. 

It is important to remember that libraries are places of learning and self-expression. They should be safe havens where individuals from all walks of life can come together to share information and ideas without fear of censorship. Therefore, I argue that libraries should continue to provide patrons with an extensive selection of materials, and should not remove or restrict access to certain materials as a practice.
