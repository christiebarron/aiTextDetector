The building of the Empire State Building presented a number of unique challenges to the architects, engineers, and strategists involved. One such challenge was to find a way to allow dirigibles, or airships, to dock on the building. Dirigibles in the early 20th Century had great potential for transportation and their ability to hover at an exact point in the sky made them ideal for more efficient and frequent travel. However, the development of mooring methods for dirigibles required a lot of forethought and ingenuity, and the Empire State Building was no exception. 

The firstobstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the complex nature of the project. Dirigibles were relatively new to the public and unfamiliar to architects, engineers, and strategists. Furthermore, the sheer scale of the building made it a daunting challenge. To dock a dirigible on top of the building, the construction team had to consider the size of the building and the surrounding cityscape and figure out the logistics of detaching the aircraft while holding the structure steady. 
 
Another obstacle the team faced was the type of materials available. The building was made of steel and concrete, which posed several difficulties. Steel was too lightweight and could not support the load of a dirigible. Concrete was too heavy for the airshipâ€™s engines and could not be used for mooring. The team had to come up with a way to use both materials to construct a mooring platform for the dirigibles.

The solution that the building team came up with was a system
