In Joe Kurmaski's short story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a significant role in the cyclist's journey. The cyclist must navigate a remote, rural road in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The landscape of the setting creates a formidable challenge for the cyclist, who must deal with the physical demands of a long and steep climb. 

The remote setting has an effect on the cyclist in psychological ways as well. The loneliness of the environment increases the difficulty of the challenge, as there is nobody but the cyclist on the long and winding road. The cyclist must rely solely on himself and his own strength to face the steep climbs and sharp turns of the narrow road. The sense of isolation is a strong presence in the story, reinforcing the harshness of the journey and testing the cyclist's mettle. 

The weather of the setting also adds to the cyclist's difficulty. It is a cold, foggy day. The lack of visibility, combined with the wet road, make for a difficult ride. The fog adds to the sense of isolation, and the slippery conditions of the road make progress on the climb more difficult than before. 

The dark and oppressive atmosphere of the setting creates an intense feeling of challenge
