It was a beautiful sunny afternoon, and I was out with my best friend. We were walking around the park, chatting about our lives and enjoying the day. The conversations easily flowed between us, and I couldn’t help but notice the lightness and joy we both felt in each other’s company. 

Suddenly, something caught my eye – a huge puddle in the middle of the path! As we emerged from the bushes, I couldn’t resist dragging my friend into it, and jumped right in, splashing her from head to toe. We both started to laugh uncontrollably, and I could feel the happiness radiating from both of us. 

We stayed there for a few minutes, just laughing and enjoying the moment and the carefree feeling of childhood. Then, we both realised we were standing in the middle of a huge puddle and that we should probably dry ourselves off! 

My friend and I had shared so many wonderful moments together, but that afternoon was especially special. We bonded on a deeper level and I knew our friendship was only going to get better, and laughter was going to be the key ingredient!
