The task of constructing a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, completed in 1931, was a daring and unprecedented endeavor. The builders of the Empire State Building were in search of a way to incorporate the new and growing technology of airships – commonly known as dirigibles – and were willing to take on the Herculean challenge of constructing a suitable mooring mast. 

The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were numerous, and the considerations included structural, engineering, and weather elements. Although the search for a practical solution was underway, the engineers had to overcome many obstacles before they could find a suitable and cost-effective way to build the mast that could withstand the imposing winds in the area. 

The most economical and resources-saving option open to the builders was to construct a three-mast platform at the very top of the building, each of the two masts containing two sets of armatures designed to withstand the strong winds at the building’s height. The plan was a very ambitious, and the workforce had to battle with the logistics of construction, winds and heavy rains, and the problems associated with the gigantic mooring ropes.

The manner in which the dirigibles would be connected and secured on the masts was an additional challenge that had to be faced in order to make the docking process secure and safe, and the builders had to overcome the problem of securing an anchor point within the masts’ three interchangeable arms. Mansard steel and wire rope cable mooring lines were the chosen materials for the armatures, allowing the weight of
