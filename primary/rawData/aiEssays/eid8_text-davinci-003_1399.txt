I remember so clearly the day I met my best friend. We were both in line at the coffee shop, each waiting for our lattes to be made, and I had noticed her upon arrival. But it was her laughter that stood out the most.

To pass the time I asked her if she wanted to hear a joke. She smiled, nodding in approval. I began to tell the story and just as I expected, my joke didn't land. She didn't laugh, but instead shook her head, a warm smile on her lips.

Suddenly, I blurted out, "You know what's funnier than the joke? Us laughing at it together." And to my surprise, we started laughing. We were side-by-side, almost like two children, uncontrollably laughing in the long line of customers.

By the time it was our turn to order, we already felt like old friends. We talked more and exchanged numbers. I haven't stopped laughing with her since.
