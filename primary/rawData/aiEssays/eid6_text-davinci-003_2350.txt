The Empire State Building was a significant architectural undertaking, but the plan for something innovative to top the building didn’t become reality until four years after its completion. The idea was to make the Empire State Building the “first land-based mooring mast for dirigibles,” according to The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. The concept of a mooring mast may have seemed like a simple solution to the problem of a great airship dock, but the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock were more complex than one might expect.

The first hurdle was the natural elements. Although the Empire State Building seemed the ideal location, it is at the heart of Manhattan, where winds are high. Therefore, the builders needed to craft a mooring system that could counter unpredictable winds and breezes and provide a stable platform for the mooring of the dirigibles. To do this, the builders had to use a combination of stationary mooring lines, payload platforms, and a network of complex pulleys and winches that could adjust for wind fluctuations dynamically.

The second issue was the size and mass of the dirigibles. While the Empire State Building provided a strong platform, its stature would not be enough to handle the mooring needs of the large dirigibles. The builders had to create a series of heavy-duty supports and reinforcing frames that extended down the sides of the building and allowed the dirigibles to moor securely without damaging the building or the dirigibles themselves.
