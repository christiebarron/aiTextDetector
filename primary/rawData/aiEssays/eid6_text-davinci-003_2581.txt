The Empire State Building was a monumental feat of engineering at the time of its completion in 1931. Constructed in less than two years, it became the tallest building in the world, making it a unique and impressive site. Despite its height and stature, the builders of the Empire State Building faced the unique challenge of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top in order to transport passengers. This task was complicated due to the complex atmospheric conditions of the environment surrounding the building, as Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted highlights in her book, The Mooring Mast.

The builders had to take a variety of different factors into consideration to ensure that dirigibles could safely dock at the Empire State Building. The first challenge was the unpredictable winds which are present around the buildings skyline. Strong winds can push a dirigible in different directions, rendering it impossible to dock the craft to the mooring mast. To counteract this, the engineers designed special adjustable cables to allow them to tether the dirigible securely to the mast. 

The next challenge was the change in air pressure around the mast. As dirigibles can be highly sensitive to external atmospheric forces, the engineers had to ensure a consistent pressure between the boat and the mast. To do this, they placed special flexible seals around the dock which acted to keep a steady air pressure, regardless of the weather. 

Finally, the engineers had to take into account the presence of other high rise buildings around the Empire State Building. Due to the turbulent air across the skyline, the dirigibles could be easily impacted by air drafts from other tall buildings, making their control difficult
