Dear Editor, 

In today's digital world, it's no secret that computers have become an integral part of our lives. While these devices have certainly made life easier and more efficient, I believe that they have also had negative effects on people.

First and foremost, I'm concerned about the impact that computers have had on personal interaction. Far too often, people are so focused on their devices that they no longer spend quality time talking to others or engaging in meaningful relationships. This can lead to isolation, loneliness, and depression. 

I'm also concerned about the strain that computers can place on our eyesight and posture. Spending long hours hunched over computer screens can cause us to suffer from eyestrain, headaches, neck and back pain.

Finally, while computers can offer us some educational and entertainment opportunities, they can also promote a sedentary lifestyle, which can lead to other health issues.

Given these concerns, I urge readers to be mindful of the time they spend on computers and be sure to take regular breaks. This can help ensure that computers are used in moderation and that they remain a tool, not a distraction.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
