The Empire State Building was an ambitious project that presented many challenges when it was designed and built in the early 1930s. One of the most difficult considerations that architects and engineers had to make was the potential inclusion of docking facilities for dirigibles, or large airships. There were a number of obstacles that had to be taken into account, including the weight of the airships and the impact of wind on their mooring. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the challenges facing the builders of the Empire State Building are discussed. 

The docking of a large airship such as a dirigible on a building of the magnitude of the Empire State Building presented a unique engineering feat. The airship would need a landing area and secure mooring at the top of the building. Moreover, the Empire State Building was not designed with the purpose of accommodating these landings. For this reason, special considerations had to be taken to ensure a safe and successful mooring. 

The weight of the airship was one of the major factors that had to be addressed in the construction of a high altitude mooring platform. The Empire State Building had reached the upper limits of what the structure could support. A strong and reliable mast would be required to bear the weight of the airship; however, the top of the Empire State Building was not wide enough to facilitate construction. The project required creative engineering solutions in order to provide a reliable and strong platform that could support the weight of a large airship.

In addition to the weight of the airship, the
