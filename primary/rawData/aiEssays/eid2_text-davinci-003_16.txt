Censorship in libraries has long been a controversial topic. Libraries are supposed to be sanctuaries of knowledge and free thought, and books, music, movies, and magazines are often lauded as outlets for self-expression. If a person wants to access certain materials or information, it should be easy to do so--regardless of their viewpoint on the subject matter.

That’s why I believe that censorship of any kind should not be applied to materials in libraries. Although offensive materials may shock and anger some readers, they should not be removed from the shelves simply because they are found “offensive.”

In libraries, readers should be able to access any book, movie, or other material they desire. We should not deny people the right to access materials that may conflict with our own personal beliefs or values. Libraries should be places where open dialogue and debate can take place without restrictions.

Furthermore, censorship can lead to a slippery slope. Once we begin to determine what materials are deemed “acceptable” or “unacceptable” for the public to access, we open the doors for more censorship. This censorship can eventually erode the free exchange of ideas, effectively stifling invention, creativity, and progress.

I understand that some materials may be disturbing or offensive, and libraries should provide easy access to resources that can help readers to understand the different perspectives offered by such materials. But any attempt to censor library materials--whether it is applied to books, magazines, movies, or music--is a violation of the public’s right to access any materials they choose. No
