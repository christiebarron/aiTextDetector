I vividly remember the moment my doctor told me I had to start a new treatment plan and that it could take weeks or even months to start seeing any kind of progress. Shortly after, I was filled with overwhelming fear and frustration when I thought about how much of my time this would take. 

It was in this moment that I chose to remain patient. I reminded myself that anything worth doing takes time and decided to try to focus on the end goal rather than the length of the process. I started to really focus on the small successes and achievements made over the course of treatment, allowing these moments to inspire me to work harder and stay positive.

My patience was tested many times throughout the course of the treatment. The days where I felt discouraged or hopeless seemed to come more and more often. Nevertheless I held on, determined to see it through.

Finally all my hard work paid off and I got the results I was striving for. This moment was sweet and I will never forget it. Being patient during the long and often difficult path was worth it, and it was a lesson I won't soon forget.
