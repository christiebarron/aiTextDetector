Dear Editor, 

I am writing today to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me. 

The technology age has presented us with many amazing gadgets and one of the most valuable resources is the computer. Computers today are so sophisticated that they can allow us to work more efficiently and do more with less effort. With the help of computers, we can get things done faster and better. 

However, people sometimes forget about the negative effects of computers on our lives. It is true that computers can help us to stay connected to others and provide us a quick and easy way to gain knowledge. The negative effects however, are still there. For example, the increased reliance on computers increases our stress levels, decreases our attention span and encourages us to ignore our personal relationships. 

I believe it is important to recognize the negative impact of computers on people. We must remember to take time to step away from our computers and focus on developing meaningful relationships with family and friends. Additionally, we should make a conscious effort to minimize our computer dependency and create better work-life balance for ourselves. 

In conclusion, computers can be a great resource when used in moderation. I urge your readers to recognize the limitations of computers in our lives and take steps to manage their use better. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
