In today’s world, it is not uncommon to come across materials that may be deemed offensive in some capacity. Whether it be in books, movies, magazines, or music, there is an inevitable tension between expression and censorship, particularly in libraries. 

It has long been the idea of libraries to facilitate the sharing of ideas and information, regardless of its contents. In essence, the function of libraries should be to educate and inform, so that readers can draw their own conclusions and lesson from the materials. This has made the decision of censorship in libraries a particularly difficult one. 

On one hand, some may suggest that books and other materials that contain inappropriate or offensive content should be removed from the shelves, to protect readers and the general public from such materials. While, on the other hand, such censorship may be viewed as an interference of one’s right to information, freedom of speech, and the ideals of libraries itself. 

After much consideration, I believe that libraries should remain a censorship-free zone. You may not agree with the material contained within, but keeping all books on the shelves essentially shows that the library trusts in the judgement of the reader, and ultimately respects the fundamental freedom of choice. Having said this, it is definitely up to the library to properly label the materials, so that patrons are aware of the content beforehand. 

In sum, libraries should treat all readers with respect, understanding that choice is a cornerstone part of freedom. To that effect, I believe books and other materials should remain uncensored in libraries, while proper content labeling is definitely essential.
