The concluding line of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” acts as a subtle reminder of the poem’s main theme: the ability to persevere in the face of difficult challenges. By framing the passing of winter with the eventualness of spring and the eventual passing of a test, Ho suggests that no matter how difficult the situation, endurance and positivity can help to overcome it. 

The poem’s narrator is a student facing a difficult test. He is overwhelmed by the challenge, especially when compared to a winter hibiscus that blooms despite the frigid conditions of winter. The winter hibiscus in the poem serves an a metaphor for the narrator's own resilience. He also recognizes that he is capable of enduring the difficulty, just like the hibiscus. 

Ho describes the winter hibiscus as "able to find the sun", which suggests the idea that even in difficult or challenging times, it is possible to find a light at the end of the tunnel. The narrator of the poem also believes that no matter what happens in the present moment, it will eventually pass and he will have the opportunity to try again. The hibiscus serves as a reminder that no matter how difficult his current situation may be, he will eventually get another chance for success. 

By suggesting that like the winter hibiscus, the narrator is capable of overcoming even the most overwhelming challenges. It is essential for the narrator to remember that a difficult situation does not equate to a permanent state of being.  Minfong
