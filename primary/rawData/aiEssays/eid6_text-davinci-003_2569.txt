The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 presented a unique challenge – designing a docking system for dirigibles. This meant taking into consideration a variety of factors and overcoming a number of obstacles in order to make it safe for dirigibles to dock. 

The first obstacle to consider was the relatively high altitude at which the Empire State Building was constructed. Dirigibles were incredibly sensitive to wind gusts, and the higher the altitude, the greater the chances of such gusts affecting them. In order to mitigate this issue, engineers designed a system of high-tension wires to keep the dirigibles stable in the air. Unfortunately, the tension wires could cause serious damage to the ships if they were not set up properly, so it was vital to get it right the first time.

The second obstacle to be accounted for was the relatively small size of the building. The top of the Empire State Building presented only a limited amount of space for the dirigibles to dock. This meant that it was necessary to make use of flexible mooring masts – tall poles from which the dirigibles could be held aloft. Of course, these masts had to be designed to withstand both the weight of the dirigibles, as well as the loads placed upon them when they were moored. 

The final obstacle to be overcome was the actual landing procedure itself – a feat made all the more tricky by the fact that the dirt and debris accumulated over the years could make the landing surface of the building’s roof unstable. To overcome this, engineers had to design a system of long
