I remember it like it was yesterday. I was out for dinner with my best friend, and we had already enjoyed a fun night of catching up. We were both joking around, getting lost in memories from our college days, when suddenly we heard someone snicker from the next table. We both looked over and saw that it was the older couple that had been sitting next to us the whole time. We couldn't help but chuckle to ourselves, because it was like the couple had been eavesdropping on our conversation the whole time. 

In that moment, I felt a connection to the couple and my best friend that I hadn't felt before. We all shared a laugh, and in that moment I felt so close to the people around me. It felt like laughter was the best way to bridge the gap between us. Those few chuckles changed our whole evening, and I'm still thankful to the couple who sparked this special connection.
