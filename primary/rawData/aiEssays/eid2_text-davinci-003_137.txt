It has become increasingly evident that censorship in libraries has become a contentious issue of late, with many discussions being held over the issue of whether or not certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. While there are certainly some valid arguments both in favor of and against censorship, I believe that a policy of selective censorship should be implemented in order to ensure that all Library patrons are able to access and enjoy a wide variety of materials and cultural expressions that are inoffensive, educational, and inspiring.

First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that the free flow of information is integral to the preservation and growth of democracy. This includes access to materials and cultural expressions that are deemed to be “offensive” by some groups. Consequently, I strongly believe that libraries should allow for the public to access and explore a vast array of materials, even if those materials are potentially offensive to some individuals. By allowing Library patrons to access, explore, and form their own opinions on a wide range of materials, Libraries not only provide an invaluable service, but they also support the exchange of ideas and freedom of thought.

At the same time, I believe that Libraries should also take extra precautionary measures to ensure the rights of all Library patrons are respected and preserved. This includes introducing a policy of selective censorship in which Libraries can remove certain materials deemed to be offensive or inappropriate, without repressing a wide variety of other material. In other words, rather than a complete ban, Libraries should only censor materials that are deemed to be offensive to a certain limit. It is important to note that this limit should be decided upon
