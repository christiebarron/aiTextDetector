The ending of ‘Winter Hibiscus’ by Minfong Ho serves to demonstrate the resilience and hopefulness of the protagonist, Yulan. At the end of the poem, Yulan has to take a difficult English proficiency test which, if she does not pass, can limit her career prospects. Yulan makes a connection between the weather and her situation, noting that the hibiscus won’t bloom until the snows have melted and the geese have returned. This vividly and powerfully conveys her determination to wait until the test has passed - yet is also recognizes that no matter what the outcome, nature will carry on and the hibiscus will bloom.

The analogy of the hibiscus serves to illustrate the malleability of Yulan’s situation. Even though the circumstances are difficult, Yulan is able to maintain a sense of optimism. She is aware that small victories bring joy, whether or not she passes the test. The metaphor of the hibiscus evokes the idea of renewal and growth - signaling that while the odds may be against her, she can still find cause for hope.

By ending with the imagery of snow melting, geese returning and the hibiscus budding, Minfong Ho encourages readers to draw strength from nature. As the poem closes, there is an implied sense of resilience - a suggestion that Yulan will find a way to succeed. By emphasizing the idea that hope springs eternal, ‘WInter Hibiscus’ serves to inspire readers to continue to strive for success,
