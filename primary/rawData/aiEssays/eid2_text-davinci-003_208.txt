The public library has always been an island of freedom in our restrictive modern world. It is a place where one can explore different ideas and cultures, away from the ever-growing omnipresence of censorship. Unfortunately, it appears that the long-standing open environment of the library is being encroached upon by some seeking to limit the availability of certain materials that they deem offensive.

It is understandable why some feel passionate about the removal of certain materials from library shelves. After all, no one wants to feel uncomfortable or threatened. However, it is important to recognize that censorship in the library can be stifling to our freedom of thought and progress as a society. The library should be a place where we can explore, discover, and challenge our own beliefs. To do this, there must be a variety of material available that reflects different perspectives to give us the opportunity to explore a wide range of ideas without fear of judgement.

Unfortunately, the impulse to suppress offending materials may give people a false sense of safety. It will not address the underlying issues, such as racism or sexism, that are found in such materials and it will not foster an environment conducive to learning or progress. Rather than removing materials, the library should be a place that encourages discussion and debate. Creating a safe and respectful forum for discussing, questioning, and exploring even the most offensive topics will further our understanding of each other and lead to real and lasting change.

With censorship in the library, we have to remember that the limits we place on ourselves, our literature, and our culture ultimately harms society. The library should be a place of liberation, not censorship
