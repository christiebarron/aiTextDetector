As the debate over censorship in libraries continues to grow in today's society, it is important for citizens to understand the implications of certain materials being removed from circulation. Advocates for free speech often cite the value of being able to access and explore ideas from a variety of perspectives, and the importance of an open exchange of ideas to the progression of modern society. While it is important to give consideration to what material is made available to library patrons, censorship should not be an immediate solution.

A library is an institution dedicated to the promotion of educational opportunities, access to resources, and connection with the greater community. In order to fulfill its mission, a library must offer a wide range of materials that span all genres, topics, and styles. By providing access to a variety of materials, a library creates a safe and encouraging environment for readers to connect with an onslaught of ideas and explore their own perspectives. Removing materials due to their potentially offensive content cuts off access to valuable and diverse ideas, and reduces the potential for readers to form their own opinion.

There is no doubt that certain materials may be considered offensive to some, and it is important to protect people of all ages from potentially damaging and inappropriate content. But this can be accomplished without the need to heavily censor library materials. Libraries can use advisory labels and warnings on books, movies, and magazines to alert readers of potentially offensive material, or censoring materials could be based on age appropriateness and other guidelines. This method of self-censorship reinforces the library's commitment to providing equitable access to resources and allows for readers to make their own informed decisions about what materials to explore
