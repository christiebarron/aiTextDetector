The features of the setting in ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski affect the cyclist in a number of ways.

The stark beauty of the desert setting creates a sense of danger and dread in the cyclist as he contemplates the long and seemingly perilous journey ahead. This sense of dread is deepened by his knowledge of the fact that there are wild beasts in the desert that could harm him at any moment. This creates in the cyclist a feeling of unease and insecurity and this is heightened by the fact he is travelling alone.
