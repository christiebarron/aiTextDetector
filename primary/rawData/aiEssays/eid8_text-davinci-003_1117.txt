I met my partner at a local bar one night. I remember him standing out because he had an infectious laugh that could fill the room with joy. One night, when we were still in the early days of our relationship, I decided to do something that made me really nervous - play an instrument I had learned to play for him. I had never done this for anyone else in my life before, and I was feeling really anxious about it, so I waited until he wasn't looking to start playing.

But as soon as I started playing, he immediately started laughing and clapping his hands in excitement. Instead of being embarrassed I was relieved, because it meant that he liked it. His laughter brought the comfort I needed to push myself forward with more confidence. That was the very first time I ever acted so confidently in front of somebody else, and itâ€™s still something I look back on fondly.

We went on to share many more moments filled with laughter. Those moments are just as meaningful as the times of deep conversation and understanding. Laughing together has brought us closer and helped us build a strong relationship together.
