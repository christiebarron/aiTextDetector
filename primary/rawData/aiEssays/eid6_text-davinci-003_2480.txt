The Empire State Building, one of the most iconic buildings in the United States, was originally built to accommodate dirigibles that could dock on its roof. Unfortunately, the project was plagued with a number of obstacles, almost causing its failure. 

The surrounding New York City skyline posed a challenge to the idea of mooring dirigibles at the Empire State Building, as there were many tall buildings that could be in the way of the airships. As Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted wrote in her book The Mooring Mast, there were numerous meetings held in order to discuss the effectiveness of the plan. The architects had to calculate how much wind the airships would need to take off and land, as well as the aeronautical forces these tall buildings might create. As a result, the design of the mooring mast had to be changed in order to avoid any interference from nearby buildings.

Another major obstacle the architects had to overcome involved maritime law. Because the Empire state was a non-navigable site, it created a technical obstacle: it was not under any marine jurisdiction, meaning that the airships could not be legally docked. Furthermore, the Navy was skeptical about the whole project, as they believed the airships to be dangerous and in need of strict control. 

Finally, the Empire State Building itself posed a challenge, since it had to be reinforced in order to withstand the powerful downdrafts generated by the airships. The roof of the building had to be strengthened in order to prevent any structural damage. This, along with numerous safety concerns, caused further delays
