I was visiting my grandparents when I was a teenager and they were planning on taking me to a restaurant for dinner. I knew that my grandpa was finding it difficult to walk recently. He hesitated and seemed hesitant to go. My grandparents had always been patient people, and they didn't seem to be in a rush so I took a few deep breaths and trusted that they had a plan. We ended up taking my aunt's car and she drove us the short distance to the restaurant. 

At the restaurant, my grandpa’s walk was even slower, he leaned on me for stability when he moved around and I could tell that he was in pain. Despite this, he was still very patient and he moved at his own pace. Rather than rushing him and getting frustrated, both my grandparents stayed calm and accepted the pace. Eventually, we arrived at the table and my grandma thanked me for understanding and being so patient. It was a reminder that sometimes things don’t always happen on our own timeline but with a little patience, you can make it.
