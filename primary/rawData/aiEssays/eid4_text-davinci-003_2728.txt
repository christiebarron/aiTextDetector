At the end of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the narrator expresses that when the hibiscus flower is budding in the spring, marking a new period of growth, she will take a test again. This sentiment beautifully captures the idea of hope in the face of adversity and embodies the idea that even after trying times, there will always be a new opportunity to try again. 

The narrator expresses this theme of hope as she contemplates a difficult decision—the choice to take a test to take her “out of this small world” of a poor Chinese Village in Thailand. Despite the fear that she feels when faced with this life-altering choice, the narrator expresses a sense of comfort and optimism in the promise of a second chance if the results do not turn out the way she hopes. 

In addition to its themes of hope, the line is also representative of the renewal of life and the possibilities of the future. The Spring is depicted as a metaphor for change, and the strong focus on the hibiscus flower allows for a sense of interconnectedness between the narrator and nature. The hibiscus is a reminder of the cyclical nature of the world, and on a larger scale, the narrator's ability to remain optimistic in the face of adversity. 

Ultimately, Winter Hibiscus’ poignant closing remarks highlight the idea that new-beginnings are possible, no matter the odds. Through the reference to the hibiscus flower growing in the spring, the narrator is expressing that no matter what trials she may face, there will still be opportunities
