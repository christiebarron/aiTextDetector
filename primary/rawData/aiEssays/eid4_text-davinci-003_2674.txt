The poem “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho is a powerful metaphor for hardship, resilience, and hope. It tells the story of a young student studying for a difficult test, but instead of studying, he finds himself fantasizing about the blooming hibiscus flower in his garden that will never be under his winter snow. He uses the image of the resilient flower to give himself hope and strength to face his own challenge, as if the hibiscus was an advisor cheering him on. 

The ending of the poem serves to cement this message of hope, emphasizing that the hibiscus will eventually break through and bloom, no matter what the challenge. With this image in mind, the student is encouraged to take the test again when spring returns-- instead of seeing it as a struggle, he sees it as an opportunity to grow alongside the hibiscus. 

Following in the footsteps of the resilient hibiscus, the student learns to face life’s challenges with hope and courage. Challenges are a part of life, but they can also be a source of motivation, rather than despair. Even in winter, when his garden is buried in snow and he is surrounded by despair, he can look to the hibiscus for the courage to take his test again. Just as the hibiscus will eventually bloom, so too will the student be able to conquer his challenge when the snows melt and the geese return.
