I remember when I first met my now-husband. We both attended the same college orientation, and from the moment we met, we just connected. One of the things that made us so close was our shared sense of humor and our ability to laugh at even the most ridiculous jokes. 

I remember the first time I brought him to meet my family. We were eating dinner and my dad, who can be pretty witty, started to tell a story that he thought would be rather humorous. I could feel everyone waiting on the edge of their seats to see if my new beau would find it funny, too.

Sure enough, he laughed - loudly and unabashedly - and it immediately felt like the entire room had opened up with joy. We all laughed together, and the awkwardness between family and the new addition to our dinner table melted away. From that moment on, he was a part of the family. 

To this day, laughter still brings us closer together. Sharing a good joke with my partner after a long day always helps to relieve some of the stress and tension between us. We may argue every now and then, but as soon as we share a funny moment or a good laugh, all of the hard feelings immediately fly out the window. 

It's really amazing how something as simple as laughter can bring so much joy and understanding to any relationship.
