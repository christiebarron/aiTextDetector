Throughout the decades, the advent of dirigibles sparked a breakthrough in airship technology that would revolutionize the way we thought about travel. During the late 1920s, the Empire State Building—at the time the tallest building in the world—had plans to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. However, several obstacles had to be overcome in order for this idea to become reality. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, The Mooring Mast, the issues faced by builders of the Empire State Building are detailed. 

The main challenge was finding a way to securely trap the dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building. Initially, the team planned to use a rope system, similar to what was already in place for aeronautic jaunts. Unfortunately, the skyscraper was too tall for the rope system and the dirigibles had to be lit differently for nighttime landings. The engineers quickly realized that attaching clamps to the dirigible and solidified poles on the Empire state building were the only viable option. The clamping system was particularly risky, as the steel frame holding the dirigible could easily break off and the ship could plummet to the ground.

Another problem faced by the engineers was the risk of navigational errors by the pilots. The area around the Empire State Building was heavily trafficked by airplanes, which could interfere with the dirigibles’ trajectory. To prevent accidents and ensure the ships’ safe navigation, engineers devised a guiding system that used flashing lights on the building’s roof to indicate the appropriate position. For added safety, the
