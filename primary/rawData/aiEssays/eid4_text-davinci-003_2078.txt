At the end of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the reader is left reflecting on the last line: “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. This line is metaphorical for the main character’s journey of discovering her identity through the eyes of her culture.

The hibiscus is the symbol for this journey. It carries the evocative power to draw her back to her cultural roots, each time revealing a little more of who she is. The snow symbolizes the struggle of each winter, with its physical and mental distances from her birthplace, drives her will harder and harder and with anticipation of the coming spring and its promises of new life. The geese are the reminder of migration and the importance of self-discovery.

Throughout Ho’s story, the journey of cultural discovery is depicted as ever changing and unpredictable, taken step by step and with no one right answer. As the hibiscus buds and evolves, so does the main character’s own identity. That is why the last line of the story is so meaningful: when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.
