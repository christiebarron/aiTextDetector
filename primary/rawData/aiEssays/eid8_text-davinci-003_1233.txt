I remember the first time I met my best friend - it was at a birthday party and we were both the same age. We were strangers that day, but something about him intrigued me and I couldn't help but approach him. 

He was standing in the corner and he looked so incredibly shy that I felt compelled to say something. I walked up to him and jokingly asked, "Why so serious?" He looked straight at me, furrowed his brow, and then just started laughing. 

His laughter was so infectious that soon I was also cackling away, and we just kept laughing until tears were streaming down our faces. Everyone around us stopped what they were doing and stared, which only made us look down in laughter more. 

That was the day I really got to know my best friend, the one that I'm still close with today. We've had times of sorrow and hardship, but those moments of laughter still continue to get us through it all.
