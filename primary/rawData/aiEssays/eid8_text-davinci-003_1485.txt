I will never forget that night we all shared together. It was my first time introducing my close friends to my extended family. 

I was nervous; I didn't know how the family would react and I was worried about my friends making a good first impression. But I needn't have worried.

As soon as my friends stepped into the house, my Uncle George was up and circulating around the group and joking around with everyone. I could see him nudge my cousins to get up and get involved too. Eventually, my friends and my family were laughing and chatting with each other like they'd known each other forever.

I was delighted. I loved the fact that everyone was enjoying themselves and that my Uncle George had managed to break the ice so quickly and bring such a buzz to the atmosphere. 

When dinner was ready, we all gathered around the table and devoured it. Uncle George was in charge of cracking jokes, and it didn't take long for him to get everyone into fits of laughter. At first, I was worried he was going too far, but when I saw the dinner table shaking and all of us laughing too hard to even swallow our food, I realized that this was how my family operated. We were all here to have a good time and enjoy ourselves, and laughter was our way of connecting with each other.

The night ended with all of us in tears, laughing together until there was nothing left to laugh about. I was so grateful that my Uncle George had been there to set the tone and show everyone how to let go and enjoy an evening just as family
