I was walking down the street, breathing in the fresh air when I heard a voice coming from an alley. It was a child, crying loudly - in distress, I figured. Without hesitation, I walked over to investigate and found a boy, hunched over, looking pale and scared. 

I asked the boy what was wrong and he explained that his mom had sent him on an errand earlier and he accidentally dropped her phone while trying to put it away, breaking it. He was so afraid to face her and tell her what happened.

I didn't want him to feel like he was in trouble and I wanted to find a way to help him. I told him not to worry and that we'd figure out something. I thought for a minute and then put together a plan. I offered to walk with the boy back to his mom and talk with her about what happened. 

We eventually arrived and his mom was so glad to see him and thankfully not angry, just relieved that he was safe. We talked about what happened and together, we decided a punishment. In the end, the boy was able to apologise and accept his mom's punishment without feeling shame. 

I was so proud of how patient and understanding his mother was during this difficult situation and how the boy had handled it. It was a true example of patience and love.
