I still remember the moment that changed how I saw laughter and how it could bring two people together. 

It was my first date with the person who I would later marry. We had gone for a casual walk and were just getting to know each other. As we walked and talked, we stumbled across an alley that was full of graffiti art. We both paused to take in the beauty of it. Then, my soon-to-be husband said something that made me laugh. It wasn’t a joke or pun but something that was so unexpected and out of left field that I couldn’t help but laugh. 

That laugh felt like a moment of connection and understanding between us. We continued on our walk and seemed to get even closer – it was like we were old friends. That laughter brought us closer and made us feel closer. To this day, that moment is one of my favorite memories. 

Laughter is a powerful thing. It has the power to break down walls, bring joy, and make connections. That experience strengthened my belief in the power of laughter and its importance in any relationship. It's something I try to remember and practice any chance I get.
