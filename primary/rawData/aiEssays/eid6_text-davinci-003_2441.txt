In 1931, the Empire State Building was built in the heart of Manhattan, becoming a symbol of the city’s ambition and success. A relatively new technology – the dirigible or airship – was also gaining popularity and some at the time suggested that a mooring mast be built on the Empire State Building’s roof to allow airships to dock there. As Marcia Amidon Lusted explains in her book The Mooring Mast, this plan posed considerable obstacles.

The crew of the Empire State Building had to first decide if the mooring mast plan was even feasible. Installation of a suitable mooring mast was a daunting task, as it would need to withstand the wind and be able to attach securely to an airship. Calculations showed that the plan would require a mast taller than the Empire State Building itself, an engineering feat of its own.The difficulties didn’t end there. The crew also had to consider safety issues and the impact that the flights and landings would have on people living and working in the area.

In the end, these obstacles proved too difficult and the plans for a mooring mast on the Empire State Building were abandoned. Those in favor of the plan argued that in time it could have been incredibly popular and profitable. After considering the environmental and structural factors, however, the team ultimately decided that the risks outweighed potential rewards.

The obstacles involved in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building’s roof demonstrated the limits of emerging technology and the need for safety regulations. They also revealed the engineering feats one must overcome to
