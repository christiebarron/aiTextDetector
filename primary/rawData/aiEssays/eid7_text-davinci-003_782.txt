I recently had to wait an hour in line at the bank due to a problem with the system. I was tempted to get impatient and angry, but I decided to be patient instead. I kept my cool, even when I started to get frustrated with the wait. I kept on watching the others in line, reminding myself that everyone is in the same situation and being a little bit more understanding of the situation. 

By the time it was my turn to be served, I felt a sense of calm and understanding. The staff were extremely apologetic for the wait, and I could tell they were doing their best. I could feel the patience in the air, and I thanked them for their efforts. In the end, I was glad I chose to stay patient as it was a much better experience for everyone.
