Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic that has been around since the dawn of the printed word. It is important to weigh the pros and cons of censorship when it comes to the public library. On one hand, libraries should be havens of knowledge and understanding. Everyone should have the right to access materials and investigate issues on their own. However, library administrators also have a responsibility to their patrons and to their community. They must ensure that their selection of materials reflects the values of their community, as well as providing a safe, respectful environment for everyone.

Therefore, library administrators should carefully consider the materials they add to their collections as well as what materials should remain and which should be removed or excluded. It is important to distinguish between offensive materials that are illegal and those which only contain certain items or topics that some may find offensive. Libraries should not remove materials simply because they are controversial as this violates intellectual freedom and basic human rights.

However, it is important to consider public safety, particularly in regards to young people. A library should exclude materials with explicit, gratuitous themes and pornography that is inappropriate for minors. It is also important to be mindful of materials that promote, incite or condone violence, hate and intolerance. Libraries should also consider materials that may contain language, images and ideas that could be damaging to the individuals or community that library serves. If a libraryâ€™s collection includes materials that contain certain sentiments which are not universally accepted, or confuse young minds and negatively affect their development, then that material should be removed.

In conclusion, library administrators should be cautious when it comes to censoring materials. Libraries
