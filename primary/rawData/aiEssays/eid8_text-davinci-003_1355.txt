I had been living in a small town in southern Spain for several months when a chance to visit the nearby city of Madrid presented itself. I had heard about the lively nightlife there, but what I hadn't anticipated was how different people's attitudes would be there. 

On my first night out in Madrid, I had no idea what to expect. I was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of people and the sheer volume of sound. Everyone was talking, laughing and enjoying themselves. My own Spanish was a bit rusty, so I began to feel embarrassed and out of place. 

As I tried to retreat, I suddenly heard a laugh that caught my attention. I followed the laugh and found a couple leaning on a wall, talking, and laughing in Spanish. They spoke so quickly I couldn't understand what they were saying, but their laughter made me smile. 

Without knowing why, I started to laugh along, adding mine to the mix. As I did, their laughter increased even more until they were both nearly doubled over in laughter. Seeing the absurdity of their laughter, my own laughter joined in and I joined them against the wall. 

We were all laughing. The two Spaniards were laughing in Spanish, the sound of which I still don't understand, but I can still feel what it meant. 

We laughed together for what seemed like hours, though it was probably just a few minutes. As we finished, they looked up and greeted me with an expression of surprise and gratitude. They still spoke Spanish, which gave it a different flavor, but their kindness was unmistakable.
