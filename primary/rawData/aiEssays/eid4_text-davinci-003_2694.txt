The concluding lines of Minfong Ho’s ‘Winter Hibiscus’ bring a poignant note of hope, invoking a bright springtime when the snows melt and the geese return. These lines, through symbolism and imagery, offer a metaphor for the cyclical journey of time and life. The winter hibiscus is a stand-in for the speaker who, like this flower, is dormant or in a state of hibernation during the winter months just before spring. The hibiscus’ re-emergence symbolizes a period of transformation and self-growth. 

Throughout the story, the hibiscus symbolizes the speaker's own struggles and successes. As the winter snow falls, the speaker’s strength and perseverance become dormant, yet the speaker carries on despite the difficulties. The speaker's resolve is mirrored in the metaphor of winter hibiscus; even though it’s not in bloom, its potential for growth remains. Similarly, the speaker holds onto the hope that, with patience and determination, their future successes are just around the corner. 

The speaker knows that to earn this brighter future, they must go through the testing times and must invest in the work that leads to growth. This work can be anything from studying for an upcoming test to the skills-building needed to overcome one’s own personal struggles. The author encourages readers to persevere through these tough times, reminding us that like the hibiscus in the springtime, we too will bloom. The winters of life are a necessary part of the journey
