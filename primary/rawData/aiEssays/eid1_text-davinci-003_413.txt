Dear Editor,

I am writing to urge your readers to consider the effects computers have on people, and how they should be used responsibly and with moderation.

We all know that computers have become an integral part of our lives. We use them to research information on the internet, to send emails to friends, and to stay connected to the world. The possibilities with technology are endless.

However, I believe that computers have a potential to have a detrimental effect on people's health. Prolonged use can cause strain on the eyes, fatigue, and even stress. This is especially true for young people who are relying heavily on computers for their socializing and learning.

Therefore, I urge people to use computers in moderation, to set up limits when using technology, and to remember to rest their eyes and get outside for some fresh air.

Let us make sure that computers do not take away from enjoying the present moment and our physical health.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
