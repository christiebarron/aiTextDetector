I recently visited a family member in the hospital who had undergone a medical procedure. I was wary of what state I would find her in, but as I arrived, she seemed in good spirits as she tried her best to make us all laugh. 

Soon, however, it became clear that the medication was taking its toll. Her words were slurred and she was struggling to stay conscious. She had just been through a great deal of pain and her body was telling her to rest. 

I sat with her and gently rubbed her arm reassuringly, making sure to keep our conversations light and the atmosphere around us peaceful. My cousins and I all told our own stories and jokes to distract her and quickly the mood lifted. We all knew that she was in pain and couldn't do much to change the situation, so we refused to become despondent and instead tried to remain patient with her. 

At that time, I saw the power of patience and respect when someone is going through a difficult time. My family member had been through a great ordeal and we were there to support and lift her spirits the best way we knew how - by being kind and patient.
