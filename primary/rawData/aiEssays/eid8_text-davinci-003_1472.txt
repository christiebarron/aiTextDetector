I have always been the shy one in any group of people, so I was surprised when I found myself on stage at an open mic night. As I nervously fumbled for words, I felt the room start to shake with laughter. My cousin, who had come to support me, had spontaneously burst out laughing and her infectious nature urged the whole crowd to join in.

Embarrassment swept through me and I felt my cheeks turn bright red. But then I glanced over to my cousin and saw the wild joy in her eyes and felt my own laughter bubbling up too. I was so touched that someone had decided to laugh along with me, and in that moment, I let go of any embarrassment and laughed along with her.

I finished my set with a huge grin on my face, and my cousin's laughter was still ringing in my ears. I realized then how special it was that someone had the courage to share a laugh with me and I will never forget that moment. It made me appreciate the power of laughter in connecting two people and I will always remember it.
