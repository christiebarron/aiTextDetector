 

The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was by no means an easy feat. The greatest obstacle faced by the builders was the lack of a suitable mooring mast. The plans for the Empire State, which were first developed in 1929, only included four masts, two of which were designed to support the television antenna while the other two were designed to offer visitors an unimpeded view of the Manhattan skyline. This meant that the only option was to devise a way of using one of the existing masts. 

In order to achieve the desired outcome, the builders turned to a combination of an established technique, a new invention, and a remarkable feat of engineering. At the heart of the solution was the “Standard Steel Mooring Mast”, which was a newly developed invention of the era, but had not yet been tested. The Standard Mast was designed to fit atop the uppermost story of the building, providing the necessary height and support for the tethering of larger airships. In combination with the existing masts, this solution would allow the dirigibles to dock directly at the mast and be safely secured for extended visits. 

The next challenge was to ensure the stability of the mast in heavy winds and during the docking of larger vessels. To achieve this, the builders employed a previously established form of construction known as the guywire system. This system used multiple cables attached to each mast, both at the upper and lower stories, to pull the mast inwards towards the center of the building. Not only would this offer the stability needed, but it also reduced
