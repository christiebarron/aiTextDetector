I remember being at the grocery store a few weeks ago, when a family of four in front of me started arguing over what to buy. It seemed like they couldn't agree on anything, and the whole situation was becoming quite chaotic. Everyone around them was becoming increasingly frustrated while they continued to argue. 

Being patient, I waited my turn and calmly watched on, understanding that it can sometimes be difficult for families to make decisions together. Eventually, the family concluded their shopping and left the store. 

As someone who had to wait for my turn, I was proud of myself for remaining patient and understanding throughout the situation. I realized that holding back my own frustration was just as rewarding for me as it was for the other people in the store.
