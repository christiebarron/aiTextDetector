I'm the type of person who loves making people laugh, so when I found out that my best friend was going through a tough break-up, I wanted to make sure I did what I could to help lift her spirits. We'd been playing word games over text to distract her from her situation, and the conversation eventually turned to puns. Instead of just replying to her with a cheesy line, I went the extra mile and made a funny voice to go with it. She replied with a groan and then a few seconds later burst out laughing. That was when we both realized just how ridiculous and funny the exchange was, and we were both cracking up.

We kept exchanging puns and funny jokes at each other and I could tell she was feeling better bit by bit. By the end of the conversation, she was smiling genuinely, a huge improvement from the state she was in before I called.

Laughing, or just smiling in general, truly is the best medicine. Even when things look down and hopeless, if you take a moment to laugh with someone, it can really turn their whole attitude around. That's why I'll never underestimate the power of laughter - it's a precious thing in any relationship, no matter how short or long.
