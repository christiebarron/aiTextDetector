The construction of the Empire State Building was an incredible engineering feat, and one of the most impressive components of the building was the 200-foot mooring mast that was built so that dirigibles could dock in the city. Despite the remarkable ambition of adding this feature, the mooring mast was a source of considerable controversy and many obstacles had to be overcome in order for it to be completed.

The first major obstacle to overcome was the construction itself. The mooring mast had to be strong enough to support the weight of a dirigible, but tall enough to make docking easy. With the building standing at 1,250 feet tall, the engineers had to solve the challenge of building this 200-foot mast without it becoming too bulky or unmanageable. To do this, the team largely used lightweight steel for the mast, in addition to a traction hoist and several stabilizing pylons.

Another key obstacle was convincing officials of the safety of the mooring mast and dirigibles in a crowded urban environment. For the people living in the city, the idea of a giant blimp docking in mid-air seemed like a disaster waiting to happen. Despite the fact that many European cities already allowed dirigibles to land in their urban environments, US officials had to be convinced to allow this new technology. To do this, the engineers had to emphasize the safety of the design and proved that the dirigibles would be — if anything — more stable when docked in New York City.

Finally, another obstacle was cost. While the total cost for building the mooring mast
