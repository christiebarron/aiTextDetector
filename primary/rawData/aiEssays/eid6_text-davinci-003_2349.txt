The Empire State Building is iconic for its revolutionary use of the dirigible docking facility at the 80th floor landing station. The ambitious project was met with a number of obstacles which the builders had to work hard to overcome. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s ‘The Mooring Mast’, the narrative sheds light on the incredible challenges that had to be conquered in order to make the dream of mooring dirigibles to the skyscraper a reality. 

The most pressing complication of the project proved to be the physical restrictions of the building itself - it had a flat roof and walls, which made it difficult to secure the dirigibles to the structure if the weather was too windy. Also, many of the original sketches of the Empire State Building showed the main structure ending at the 78th floor, making it impossible for the dirigibles to access the docking station. The builders were then forced to raise the height of the building by two more floors in order to allow for the dirigibles, although this was an extravagant and time-consuming feat. 

Once the groundwork had been laid, the technicians had to ensure the wide-reaching safety of anyone who attempted to use the station. This included pouring extra foundations to secure the docking mast, creating an even stronger mooring point, and strengthening the walls of the top floors. The engineers also had to develop strong elevator systems to allow passengers to disembark from the dirigibles and descend safely to the ground floor. Aside from safety protocols, there were also major financial considerations taken into account. This included leasing the rights from the
