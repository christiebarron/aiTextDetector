In the early 1900s, the concept of airship travel was quickly becoming a popular form of transportation. With the emergence of this new form of travel, engineers began to consider the possibility of using mooring masts to dock dirigibles. The Empire State Building, completed in 1931, would be the first structure in the world with the capability of accommodating airships. But before it could become a reality, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome a number of engineering and construction hurdles. 

The most significant obstacle was finding a way to construct a docking mast which was tall enough to meet the requirements of the dirigibles while also meeting the height of the building. The Empire State Building is twelve hundred and fifty feet tall and the mast that was planned to be built on the rooftop had to be at least four hundred and fifty feet so that the dirigibles had the clearance they needed. This meant that the mast had to be strong and secure enough to support the weight of the airships, even during the frequent high winds that can buffet towers of that height.

In addition to the height constraint, engineers had to to deal with logistical issues in order to create a practical mooring mast. The mast had to be constructed so that its center of gravity was low enough to provide stability as the dirigibles docked. Additionally, to limit the swaying of the mast, the current design called for steel cables that attached the mast to the building on the lower levels. This posed an engineering challenge as the cables had to be strong enough to support the mast while also having enough give to allow the
