I remember the day I started my very first job. I was so nervous and excited all at the same time. I arrived early on my first day but soon realized that my manager wouldn't be there for hours. 

At first, I was frustrated - I had a lot of important paperwork that needed to be filled out and all I wanted was to show I was a dependable worker. But instead of losing my patience, I decided to take the opportunity to explore the office and get to know my new coworkers. 

I spent several hours meeting my colleagues, rearranging my desk, and learning the company policies. Eventually, my manager showed up and I was able to move on with the paperwork, but I was glad that I had taken the time to get to know the people around me. 

Patience often pays off, and Iâ€™m so glad I was patient that day. I learned very quickly how important it is to be understanding and tolerant when dealing with difficulties.
