The Empire State Building was an engineering marvel when it could fit the mooring mast for landing dirigibles atop its observation deck upon completion in 1931. This remarkable feat was achieved despite various obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to accommodate the dock. 

The first obstacle was the height and shape of the building. Since no building had previously exceeded 110 stories, the Empire State Building’s 102 stories created uncertainty regarding how the dirigibles would respond to the building’s vertical superstructure. Additionally, the 381-meter tall mast had to be light enough to support the weight of a mooring dirigible without bending or breaking.

The second obstacle was the geography of Manhattan. The area around 35th street of New York City is home to several hotels, department stores and busy intersections. This caused excessive turbulence for the dirigibles, a threat to the safety of passengers and surrounding buildings. The obstacles increased the difficulty for a safe docking, as the winds may create risky shifts in altitude.

The third obstacle was the cost to build the mast. The Empire State Building had already gone over the budget several times during its construction and the mooring mast was estimated to cost half a million dollars. Eventually, the owners of the building were able to scrap together the funds necessary to make the Empire State Building the first skyscraper to serve as a home for mooring dirigibles.

Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when seeking to accommodate the docking of dirigibles in Manhattan. Despite unforeseen difficulty posed by the height and
