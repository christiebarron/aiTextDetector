 

I remember the time my son was learning to ride his bike. We went out to the local park and he was so excited to get started. He had watched other children and felt ready to try it on his own. 

It wasn't long before he fell off, which I expected. I tried to stay positive and encourage him to try again, but he was getting frustrated and upset at himself. I could see that he was about to give up so I thought of ways to help him stay patient. 

First, I praised him for each attempt he was making, no matter how small or unsuccessful, telling him that he was already making great progress. Next, I broke the process down into small steps and showed him that if he achieved each step, he would get closer to achieving his goal. 

Finally, I reminded him that practice makes perfect and that he would be an expert rider soon — and that it was ok if it doesn't happen overnight. 

By the end of the day, my son had learned to ride his bike without falling off, and he beamed with pride at his achievement. Watching him, I was filled with so much pride — not only in his success, but in how patient he had been while trying.
