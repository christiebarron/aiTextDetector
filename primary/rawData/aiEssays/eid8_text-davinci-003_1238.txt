I was walking home from the library one evening, eager to get away from the cold winter air, when I passed by a park near my house. The sound of laughter and chatter caught my attention, and I realized it was coming from a group of teenagers gathered around a fire pit in the park. I found myself drawn in by their lively conversation and infectious laughter and began to make my way towards them.

As I got closer, I soon realized why they were so happy: they were exchanging new jokes and stories they’d heard from one another. I couldn’t help but smile as I listened to their contagious laughter and chatter, and felt my own burst of laughter rushing out of me.

The group didn’t seem bothered that I had joined their group and welcomed me in, laughing and telling jokes until the early hours of the morning. By the time I eventually went home, after hours of laughter-filled conversation, the cold weather was no longer an issue. Instead, I had a newfound appreciation for the contagious power of laughter and the people who so easily embraced it.
