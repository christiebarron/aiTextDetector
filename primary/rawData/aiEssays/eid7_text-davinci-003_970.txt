I was recently shopping for groceries and got to the check out counter. Unfortunately, the customer in front of me had an issue with their card and had to use a different one. I showed understanding and did not get annoyed. Instead, I gave the cashier a cheerful smile and said “take your time.”

The customer quickly apologized and was fully aware that the delay was entirely their fault. The checkout attendant thanked me for my understanding and asked me the same question multiple times. Instead of getting irritable, I patiently repeated my order and thanked them as they returned items to their respective shelves.

By the end of our transaction, the attendant and customer both thanked me for my patience. This was a strange situation to be in, but I felt proud of how I handled it. Being patient was the right thing to do, and I was glad to have seen it through.
