The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow a novel form of transportation – dirigibles – to dock at the building. The sheer size of these airships presented a major challenge since they were much bigger than an airplane and required a structure to tie them to. To meet this challenge, the Empire State Building engineers constructed an experimental mooring mast atop the building. Known as “The Mooring Mast”, it was the first of its kind in the world.

The main obstacle the engineers faced when creating the mast was the weather. Aviation innovations prior to the mooring mast had been hindered by the turbulent winds that buffeted the New York area. To combat this, engineers came up with a unique solution – adding a set of four massive guy-Wire cables to the mast. This allowed the cables to absorb wind-induced pressure and keep the mast relatively stable. The engineers also designed the entire dock with aerodynamics in mind, making sure the mast and structure were shaped in such a way that air would flow smoothly up and over the entire structure.

Other challenges faced by the engineers included the sheer weight of the airships themselves, and making sure that the mooring mast was secured in such a way that it would not be ripped off the building by a powerful gust of wind. To meet this challenge, engineers placed a brake system at the base of the mast, so pilots could quickly adjust the mast position and speed of their ships to match the wind direction.

The engineers also faced safety issues while attempting to comdeck new technology with an existing building. To ensure
