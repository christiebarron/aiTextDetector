The builders and managers of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles as they worked to accommodate and allow new technology of dirigibles to dock in the building. The idea of tying a large blimp to the mast of the Empire State Building was incredibly ambitious and complex. Despite the numerous challenges that the builders faced, they were able to ultimately design what is now known as the mooring mast.

The first obstacle faced was the need for a tall and sturdy mast that could support the large dirigible. The original design on the Empire State Building only allowed for a five foot mast and a set of cables to secure the dirigible. This design issue necessitated a unique solution to make room for larger dirigibles to safely dock. After consultation with engineers and architects, the mast was redesigned and extended to 197 feet, with a diameter of 12 feet wide. This allowed for much larger dirigibles to dock and moor safely.

A second challenge in making the mooring mast functional was related to the architecture of the building. When the building was constructed in 1931, the architects did not consider that dirigibles would need to dock at the building in the future. Thus the building itself needed to be modified in order to safely moor dirigibles. The design team installed a special platform located directly below the mast, which provided additional support of the dirigible and added stability while docked.

The third obstacle faced by the Empire State Building team was environmental in nature. Wind and high winds posed significant challenges to the safe operation of the mooring mast. To combat this, the designers installed
