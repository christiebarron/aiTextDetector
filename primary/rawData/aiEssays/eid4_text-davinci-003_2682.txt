In Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus”, the narrator reflects on their studies and an upcoming test. The poem ends with the narrator stating that they will “take that test again” when the winter hibiscus buds in spring. 

This statement represents optimism and hope in the face of difficult odds. The narrator is suggesting that they have a year to prepare, armed with knowledge and equipped to succeed. By ending on this note, the poem implies that regardless of the obstacles and difficulties the narrator will face, they will remain determined to better themselves. This is an uplifting message that encourages perseverance in the face of adversity. 

In addition, the poem links the hibiscus in winter with the narrator’s plans for the future. Just as the hibiscus will bloom when its appropriate season arrives, so too will the narrator approach their test again when its time has come. This connection is mirrored in the references to the geese returning, symbolizing the cycle of nature and the opportunities presented to those who wait for them. The narrator is suggesting that this test is only the first of many on the path to success, and that with patience and hard work, the desired outcome can be achieved.

Flowers have a long history of representing transformation, and in “Winter Hibiscus”, the hibiscus serves as a metaphor for the narrator’s own growth. The revival of the flower proclaims a message of renewal and comfort, signifying that all is not lost and that another chance awaits.
