In the book Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the protagonist Hua struggles with taking the SAT’s mandated by her traditional Chinese parents. She ultimately decides to not take them and instead choose to work on her family farm. By the end of the book, Hua reflects on her decision with the line: “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?”

The symbolism of the “winter hibiscus” and the transformation of the flower from winter to spring reflects Hua’s journey of self-discovery throughout the novel. The hibiscus, blooming in the winter while other flowers fail to survive, serves as a symbol of the resilience Hua must possess in order to carry out her own plan despite the wishes of her parents. Therefore, the ending of the novel serves as a reminder to Hua of her newfound strength and her potential to take the test at a future date.

The ending of Winter Hibiscus leaves Hua with a great sense of hope for what might come in the future. By replacing fear and trepidation with anticipation, Hua is hopeful for her future and optimistic about her ability to achieve her dreams and meet her parents’ expectations. This ending also serves as a reminder of Hua’s renewed commitment to follow her own path and aim for the goals she has set for herself. 

The ending of Winter Hibiscus provides inspiration to all readers who may feel lost or confused about their future;
