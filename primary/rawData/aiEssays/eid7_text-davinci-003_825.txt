As I watched my little brother, who was six years old at the time, intensely and eagerly trying to construct a model fire truck, I couldn’t help but smile. His little hands worked diligently, piece by piece, as he followed the instructions on the back of the box. His brow was furrowed in concentration and he was trying his best, but unfortunately it didn’t seem to be going right. Every time my brother, who was so proud of his accomplishments, thought he was making progress, something would go wrong and he would have to start all over again. 

I could have easily swooped in and corrected his mistakes but in that moment I felt it was more important to be patient with him and let him learn from his own mistakes. The whole process was taking much longer than I thought it should take him, but I could tell he was learning so much more than I ever could have taught him in that moment. He struggled and worked harder than I have ever seen him work, but I never said a word.

When the time came for him to finally make it all the way to the end and when the firetruck was complete, I knew he had learned something far more valuable than I ever could have taught him – the importance of persistence. His face lit up with joy and accomplishment, and I was proud of him for continuing to take the initiative and stick with it until it was finished. Being patient with him during that moment paid off and it was a precious sight to behold.
