The Empire State Building is an iconic landmark that has been a symbol of American industrial ingenuity since its completion in 1931. Dirigibles, or airships, were designed to dock at the Empire State Building’s top as early as 1930. However, the dream of a docking station in the sky was fraught with numerous challenges and setbacks that would ultimately prevent the realization of this ambitious goal. 

The largest obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered was the location of the structure itself. The top of the Empire State Building sits above Manhattan’s skyscrapers and is exposed to the harsh winds of the city. The vertical winds decreased the stability of the craft and complicated the mooring process, making it difficult to secure the dirigibles to a structure designed for the gusts. As designers understood that the Empire State Building’s location would prove a challenge, they sought to design a mooring mast that would provide sufficient stability.

In 1930, the builders proposed a mooring mast of an unprecedented height – at 900 feet, it was to be the tallest structure in the world. Architecturally, this was a daunting task with many questions yet to be answered. Could a mast of this size withstand the winds of Manhattan? Would the weight of a fully grown dirigible be too much for the mast? The answers to these questions remained largely unknown until the mast was built and tested. 

Despite attempts to test the mooring mast to the best of the team’s abilities, the mast failed its first trial in 1931. After months of alterations, engineers eventually concluded
