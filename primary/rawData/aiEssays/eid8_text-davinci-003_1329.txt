I can't forget the feeling of laughter that my grandmother and I shared. It was a scorching summer and I was visiting my grandma for the weekend. After finishing all the chores, we both decided to take a break. 

“Let’s play a game,” she suggested and I readily agreed.

The game was one that we had played together many times before. It was a game of “Twenty Questions”. We each took turns making silly and often silly questions of each other, the aim of the game being to find out the identity of the object each of us had thought of - two completely different objects.

As we went through each round of questions, the laughter between us grew more and more intense. As a result, the game lasted much longer than it normally would. We continued to exchange funny questions and stories, laughing as we went.

It felt like I had let every emotion out with that laughter, and my worry and exhaustion began to fade away.

My grandma and I would always joke that we were best friends because we shared so many memories together, but that day with its incredible amount of laughter solidified our friendship even more. Every time I visited after that special day, the laughter was so strong that it was almost tangible.
