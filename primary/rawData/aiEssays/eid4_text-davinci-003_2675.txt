The ending of ‘Winter Hibiscus’ by Minfong Ho alludes to the idea of growth, even when things seem bleak. The protagonist successfully realizes that, despite a difficult winter season, the passing of time will bring joy, confidence and a renewed determination to succeed. 

The story is set during the winter, when a test at an English college looms over protagonist Yi Min. She is confident in her Chinese abilities but struggles with her studies in English, experiencing a great deal of stress and an overall feeling of failure. While out walking one afternoon, Yi Min is surprised to find a hibiscus in bloom, despite the cold weather. She decides that the flower is a symbol of hope and determination. She contemplates the flower's persistence, despite the freezing temperatures and draws courage and strength from its example. 

The story culminates with the protagonist taking solace in the thought that, regardless of fear or obstacles, she can strive to become better if she is just as resilient as the hibiscus. In the end, Yi Min vows to take the test again in the spring, confident that she will have ample time during the winter to cultivate her knowledge and further improve. 

The symbolism of a simple bloom in winter captures the importance of persistence and growth, even when faced with adversity and uncertainty. It is a reminder that those who hold strong to their dreams, despite obstacles and outside influence, can reach their goals in the long run. As Minfong Ho argues, ‘Winter Hibiscus’ provides a narrative of hope and strength in the face of hardship
