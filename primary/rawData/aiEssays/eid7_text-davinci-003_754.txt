Looking back, I realize now just how patient I was when I first started my job as a waitress. My manager was quite particular and wanted everything to look and be a certain way. I was new to this line of work and was determined to do the best job I can, so I was willing to listen and learn.

At first, it was a struggle to meet his expectations. Every shift was filled with instructions about how to fold the napkins and the proper way to serve the customers. No matter what I did, I seemed to make a mistake in his eyes.

But instead of getting frustrated or angry, I focused on improving and remembered what a great experience I was gaining. Surprisingly, I found myself growing more patient with each passing day.

Before I knew it, I was an expert and was able to do all of my tasks with ease. I had grown comfortable enough in the job to even offer advice to the other wait staff. I could tell my manager was pleased with my progress and my patience made reaching that point so much easier.

I'm so glad I didn't give up, because I eventually turned into a great waitress and gained a valuable experience.
