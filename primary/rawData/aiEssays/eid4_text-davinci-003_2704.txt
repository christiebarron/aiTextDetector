The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem ‘Winter Hibiscus’ serves as both a contemplative question and a statement of resilience in the face of hardship. By linking the protagonist’s learning of Chinese to the hibiscus and its eventual budding, Ho emphasizes the idea that learning is a natural process that takes time and patience. The protagonist, unable to pass the Chinese test and feeling pressured by society to learn, is comforted by the reminder that while he may not pass the test immediately, he can trust that the hibiscus and his studies will return when the time is right.

The poem sets this idea of delayed gratification in vivid imagery, such as winter’s cold temperatures and the geese’s annual migration. Winter is a prime example of how nature, though harsh, provides a much-needed break from the heat, allowing both plants and animals the chance to rest and restore. Similarly, the sight of the geese’s return serves as a reminder that regardless of its departure, spring will come round again and bring with it the much-awaited warmth.

With this in mind, Ho entreats the protagonist to remember that though he may not pass the test at once, there will come a time when his Chinese studies will become effective. He likens the protagonist’s progress to the hibiscus, with its cycles of growth and rest. The message behind Ho’s words is that learning, in all forms, takes time and practice; that with patience and perseverance, the reward of success is well within
