 

Dear Editor,

I am writing today to discuss the effects computers have on people. Computers have had a profound impact on our lives, both positive and negative. The positives are easy to see: computers enable us to quickly and easily access information, allow us to virtually connect with people around the world, and provide a way to automate and simplify a variety of tasks. 

But the negatives effects of computers must also be considered. Too much time spent in front of screens has been shown to cause physical and psychological health issues such as obesity, depression, and neck and back pain. Computer screens also strain our eyes and can contribute to sleep deprivation. We must also be mindful of the potential of cyber crime, online bullies, and online addiction.

Due to the number of potential negative effects, I believe it is essential that we limit our use of computers, with particular caution being taken when it comes to children and teenagers. We should also inform our peers and family members about the risks associated with too much computer time. 

Computers have been a great asset to our lives, but we must take the necessary precautions to protect ourselves from the potential downsides. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
