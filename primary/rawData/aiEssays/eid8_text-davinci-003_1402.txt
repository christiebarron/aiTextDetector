I was at a party with a group of friends I hadnâ€™t seen in quite a while. We were all catching up, recalling our wild past, and generally having a great time. After a few hours of conversation, our conversation turned to an argument about whether it was possible to fold a piece of paper in half more than 7 times. Of course, someone had to go and prove the point, claiming they could fold it at least 8 times.

We all started laughing, because it seemed impossible to do. Then, sure enough, my daring friend pulled out a sheet of paper, and proceeded to carefully and slowly fold the paper exactly 8 times. Of course, we all roared with laughter, patting her on the back for her accomplishment.

That moment of laughter brought us all closer together, as if it were a shared experience that solidified our relationship and connection. It felt great to finally let out the tension and doubts we all held up until that moment. After that, I knew our friendship was back on track for good.
