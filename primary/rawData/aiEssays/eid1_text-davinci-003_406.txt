Dear [Editor],

I am writing to express my views on the impact computers have on people. I firmly believe computers have made our lives much easier and improved our quality of life in many ways.

We now have the ability to find information in seconds. Searching for an answer used to take a lot of time, but now can be done in a matter of moments. Computers have also enabled us to communicate with one another much more quickly and easily, enabling us to stay in touch with those we would not necessarily be able to stay in touch with.

Computers also have made a significant contribution to the economy. It has enabled businesses to become more efficient and cost-effective, allowing them to produce more products in less time. The cost of production has also decreased due to computers, making products more affordable for consumers.

The most important impact computers have had on people is that they have made access to knowledge and entertainment much more accessible. Now, from the comfort of oneâ€™s own home, we can access a wealth of information, as well as enjoy exciting new media, such as streaming films, music and games.

In conclusion, computers have revolutionized our lives and made them more efficient and enjoyable. They are essential to our daily lives, and I strongly believe that their effects on people should be celebrated.

Yours sincerely,
