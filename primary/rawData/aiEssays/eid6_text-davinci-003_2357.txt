The construction of the Empire State Building was a remarkable achievement for the early twentieth century, but building a site for dirigibles to dock safely and securely presented unique problems for the builders. In the 1930s, dirigibles were a popular mode of transportation, so creating a suitable and secure mooring station on top of the Empire State Building was a welcome challenge for the builders. However, these ambitious plans posed a number of practical and safety issues that needed to be addressed. 

The first obstacle the Empire State Building builders faced was the complex environment of New York City and the need to keep passengers and crew safe. Tests conducted at the nearby Brooklyn Navy Yard demonstrated that the winds that blew across the river made it difficult to navigate and keep dirigibles stationary. To navigate such perilous winds and protect the passengers, the builders had to modify the design of the mooring mast. They had to devise a system that would help passengers disembark safely, even during extreme conditions.

The builders also had to contend with the complex technicalities of the mast. To securely attach dirigibles to the platform, the builders had to use extra-long cable lines and cushioning systems to protect the vehicles from excessive strain and vibration. To make these solutions more durable, complex configurations of anchorages and booms had to be implemented. To stabilize the motion of the dirigible, the builders had to develop special landing aids, such as guide wires and adjustable winches, which would provide additional control over the aircraftâ€™s direction and speed. 

The Empire State Building builders also had to take into account the weight of the
