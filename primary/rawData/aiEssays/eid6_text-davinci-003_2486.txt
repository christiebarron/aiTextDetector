The construction of the Empire State Building marked a monumental moment in American history. It was one of the tallest buildings in the world, containing 102 stories and standing 1,250 feet high. Perhaps one of the most ambitious and impressive tasks in creating the Empire State Building was the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of the building. However, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome numerous obstacles for this to be successful.

The first of these obstacles was getting approval from the city government in New York City, which was not easy. After numerous debates, the mayor finally agreed to give approval for a “mooring mast” on the roof of the Building. This was a tall steel mast with a platform on top that would be used to safely dock the dirigibles.

The second obstacle was making sure the mooring mast was able to stand up to the wind and weight of the dirigibles. Tests were conducted to see if the steel mast could handle the load and intense winds. After a few alterations, the mast proved to be strong enough to hold the weight of any dirigible.

Thirdly, the builders had to be sure the platforms on top of the mooring mast were large enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Although the towers were tall and the mast was strong, there was still the possibility that the dirigibles wouldn’t be able to land safely on the platform. To combat this, engineers constructed a large 23-foot long platform that could transport the dirigibles.

Moreover, engineers had to make sure the platform
