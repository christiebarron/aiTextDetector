I was driving my grandmother to the store the other day, and I was running late. I was frustrated I was running late, but my grandmother seemed calm. I asked her why she wasn't worried about being late and she told me that sometimes things just don't go as planned and it's okay to take a deep breath and be patient. I found myself calming down and taking slower breaths. We eventually got to the store, but it was later than we had planned. Despite the delay my grandmother was still in good spirits, and she thanked me for being so patient. I'm glad I took her advice, because it made the experience a lot more enjoyable for both of us.
