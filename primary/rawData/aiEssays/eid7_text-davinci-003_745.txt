I was recently at the grocery store and feeling extra patient. I was in no rush and gracefully waited in the long checkout line without complaint. As I finally got up to the cashier, she apologized for the wait and told me she was running a bit behind. She then proceeded to ask me each and every question when ringing me up.

Instead of getting annoyed, I kindly answered each question and asked about her day. We ended up having a nice conversation by the time she finished checking me out. Once I stepped away, I noticed a few other customers were aggravated waiting in line and were scowling at the cashier.

I felt proud of myself in holding my patience, and it felt great bringing a bit more joy into the world. The warm feeling of kindness was absolutely worth the wait!
