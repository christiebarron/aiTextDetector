I was walking in the park with my best friend, Tom, on a beautiful summer day. The sun was out, the birds were chirping, and everything seemed perfect. We were talking about school and work and the usual when Tom made a joke about how he was going to add a few extra chapters to the book he was writing. We both laughed until tears were streaming down our faces and our stomachs hurt from the effort.

It felt like no time had gone by before we were laughing again, and it was the best feeling in the world. We looked at each other, both of us grinning in the moment, and I couldn’t help but think that this was what true friendship was all about: spending time together, being able to rely on each other, and most importantly, being able to share a good laugh. That single moment of laughter was the perfect reminder that no matter what, we would always have one another—and I wouldn’t trade that for the world.
