I remember the first time I met my now-husband. We had been talking for a few weeks, but we were about to have our first face-to-face meeting at a small cafe in our city. I was nervous, but when I saw him, I couldn't help but laugh.

He had come wearing a bright orange shirt with a cartoon character on the front, something he had casually mentioned over text. It looked even more ridiculous in person and I was so surprised I couldn't help but giggle. 

And then he began to laugh too, and his laugh was contagious. It filled the whole cafe and I felt like I had known him forever. We laughed and talked and laughed some more, and it felt like something special was happening between us. 

We've been married for five years now, and laughter still plays an important role in our relationship. We make each other laugh constantly, and it's a reminder of how much joy and connection our relationship is based on. Today, we can still turn to laughter to bring us closer together.
