The Empire State Building, completed in 1931 and located in New York City, offered a unique architectural feat for its time. Although the idea of the building included provisions for dirigibles to dock, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock were considerable. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book “The Mooring Mast”, readers gain insight into the various complexities of such a feat.

The builders first encountered the issue of where to moor the dirigibles meaning they had to find a spot on the building that could safely hold the vehicles. This required that they had to ensure the building was constructed with an appropriate foundation immensely strong enough to hold the sheer weight of the airships. The experience and skill of the builders and engineers crafted a strong mooring platform the size of two baseball fields on the 103rd floor of the building.

With the platform in place, the builders also had to consider constructing a mooring mast that could reach nearly 1000 feet in height, extending higher than the tip of the building's spire.
The challenge of erecting such a tall structure came with its own obstacles, including dealing with strong winds at such heights, which were capable of causing structural issues and putting people's safety at risk. Additionally, the mooring mast had to be stable enough to safely attach to the dirigibles so that their cabins stayed free from extreme turbulence and other movement that could potentially injure passengers.

The most difficult issue to overcome was the issue of constructing an adequate system of cables and pulleys to
