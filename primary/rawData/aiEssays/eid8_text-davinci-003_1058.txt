I remember it like it was yesterday. It was one of those days, you know what I mean - a day when nothing seemed to go right. I was frustrated, angry and irritable… until I saw her. 

She was standing in line in front of me at the store, and something about the way she smiled drew me in. I could hear her casually joking around with the cashier and with the other customers, and I found myself shaking my head in amazement at her positive spirit. 

Before I knew it, I was cracking a joke too. She turned around and caught my eye, and within seconds we were both laughing. It felt like the gods had answered my call that day, because that shared laughter felt like nothing else. It felt like a weight had been lifted, like I’d finally been given a reprieve from the toils of life.

We talked for a few minutes before she had to leave. We vowed to keep in touch, and I left with a newfound energy and a smile. 

To this day, I look back on that moment and wonder if it was all just a dream, but I know what I felt was real - it was the healing power of laughter.
