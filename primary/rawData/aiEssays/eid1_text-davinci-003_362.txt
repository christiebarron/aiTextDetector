Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the recent surge of computer usage among people, and the widespread effects it can have on our lives.

In todayâ€™s technology-driven society, computers are used everywhere and can be found in almost every household. It is undeniable that computers have made our lives much easier and provided us with countless benefits. However, I believe that too much reliance on computers comes with its own set of problems. 

Firstly, computers can limit our creative thinking abilities, as well as our ability to solve problems independently. People tend to become passive when using computers, relying fully on the computer to solve their problems. As a result, important skills such as critical thinking, reasoning, and problem solving are being neglected.

Apart from that, extensive computer use has also been linked to physical health problems. Sitting for long periods in front of a computer can cause bad posture, resulting in stress on our joints and back. In addition, the use of screens can take its toll on our eyesight. 

It is important to note that computers should be used in moderation, as with any other things. Only then can we reap the maximum benefits it can offer while avoiding the risks. 

Therefore, I would like to urge everyone to use computers responsibly, and use them as an added advantage in their lives instead of relying on it too heavily. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
