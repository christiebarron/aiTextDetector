In Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is at risk of injury due to the challenging terrain and the weather conditions. The setting of the story plays a crucial role in demonstrating how it can impact the cyclist.

The road that the cyclist is biking on has been described as “rocky and untamed.” The rough surface means that the cyclist is more likely to suffer a fall and sustain an injury due to the unstable terrain. Additionally, the road has deep crevices which could cause the cyclist's tire and wheel to become stuck, further increasing the risk of an accident.

The weather during the cyclist’s ride is also described as being “bitter cold.” This makes it harder for the cyclist to control their bike, as the freezing temperatures cause their hands to become numb and their muscles to tense up. As a result, they have less control and are at a higher risk of losing control of their bike, leading to potential injury.

The setting of Rough Road Ahead thus puts the cyclist at an increased risk of injury due to the rough terrain and the harsh weather conditions. These features highlight the need for cyclists to remain aware of their settings when venturing out
