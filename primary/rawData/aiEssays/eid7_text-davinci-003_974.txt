I was recently visiting my friend's new home for the first time. We planned to spend the day relaxing and catching up. But what had started out as a perfect day quickly turned sour. 

As we began to cook lunch, things started to go wrong. The stove couldn't seem to get to the right temperature, and my friend was getting increasingly frustrated. But I simply remained calm and patient throughout the whole ordeal. 

I reminded my friend that taking a deep breath and starting again can often solve a problem. Through my patience and understanding, I was able to help her keep her composure and figure out a solution.

Eventually, we figured out the problem and were able to have the wonderful afternoon we originally planned. But what had started out so difficult was due in part to my patient demeanor and understanding. Patience can sometimes be the secret to tugging through complicated situations unscathed.
