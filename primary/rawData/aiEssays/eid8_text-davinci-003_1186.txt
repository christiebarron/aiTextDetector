I remember the first time I laughed with my husband. We had just been married, and it still felt like a dream. We were walking on the beach, talking and enjoying the fresh air, when he suddenly said something that caught me by surprise. He had made a funny, sarcastic comment about a movie we had both seen and I burst out laughing.

I looked over to find him grinning and, without thinking, I reached out to touch his shoulder and we locked eyes. That's when I knew something special was happening between us. In that moment we had created a connection that could only be formed through this burst of laughter. We continued laughing together, feeling more united and bonded with each other than ever before.

Laughter has continued to be an important part of our relationship, allowing us to have fun and enjoy life together. Each time we laugh at something, even if itâ€™s in the middle of a serious conversation, a moment of shared joy and humor arises. This fleeting feeling recharges our connection and I can't help but smile anytime I think back on that day on the beach.
