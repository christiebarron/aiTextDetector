I was on a bus when an elderly woman got on the bus carrying three full shopping bags. It was clearly difficult for her to maneuver with the bags and make her way down the aisle. Everyone else on the bus seemed to be in a rush and just wanted her to hurry up and take her seat, but I was patient. I stood up and offered to help her carry her bags and walked with her down the aisle until she found an open seat.

I could tell she was very thankful for my assistance, and the other passengers on the bus just stared at me in disbelief. It felt good to be able to help someone in need and to show others that it’s important to be patient and show kindness, even when it’s difficult.
