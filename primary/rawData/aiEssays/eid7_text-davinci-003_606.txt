Once, I was mentoring a young colleague in the office. Events at work had been chaotic because of downturns in the industry. As a result, there was a large amount of pressure on her new position, as she needed to learn quickly and contribute to the success of the team. 

At times, my colleague seemed overwhelmed and discouraged. Rather than getting frustrated, I reminded her that it will take time to get up to speed. To give her extra encouragement, I offered her the chance to shadow me in team meetings and to come to me with any questions she had.

With patient guidance, she soon became familiar with the tasks she was doing and even began to offer insightful suggestions to the team. Seeing her successes gave me joy and showed me that patience can lead to greater understanding and appreciation.
