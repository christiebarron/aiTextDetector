I recently had a friend who was going through a tough time. She had to make a big decision that wasn't easy, but she wasn't sure what to do and she was really overwhelmed. I could tell she was really stressed and was worried about how it was all going to play out. 

So I decided to just be there for her and be patient. I did my best to listen when she wanted to talk and I didn't judge or give her unsolicited advice. I respected that she had to make this choice for herself and I had faith in her to do the right thing.

I was patient through all of her ups and downs and was ultimately rewarded when she made her decision. She knew that I had been there for her and that I wanted the best outcome for her, even if it meant she had to make a difficult decision. In the end, she was really grateful for my patience and understanding, and we both ended up feeling better knowing that she had made the best decision for her.
