Books, music, movies, and magazines have been part of libraries since the inception of the institution. They are educational resources meant to be accessible to anyone and everyone, and it can be argued that libraries should not be censored and remain as neutral venues for learning.

Libraries have traditionally catered to a broad swath of the population, including children, young adults, and adults. Censoring library material means removing access to resources that could possibly provide an educational opportunity, which defeats the core principle of libraries as an open and fair institution. In short, censorship of public libraries is antithetical to their core function. 

The concern that inappropriate or offensive materials should not be shared with the public is a valid point. However, rather than taking the material away from the public, libraries can provide better access to those that seek the said material, be it for educational or recreational purposes. Libraries can keep censored materials in a separate section, with parental advisory warnings, or limit the age group allowed to access them. 

In short, libraries should not be censored as it goes against their core principle of neutrality. Moreover, instead of censorship, libraries can provide appropriate access to controversial material by placing it in separate sections and using parental advisory warnings to indicate their controversial content. This will ensure that those who need access to books, music, movies, and magazines, regardless of what they hold, will have access to them at libraries.
