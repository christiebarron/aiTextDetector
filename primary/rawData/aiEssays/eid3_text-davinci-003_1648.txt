In Joe Kurmaski’s poem “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist. The narrator of the poem is confronted with an intimidating landscape that presents as an obstacle between him and his destination. The narrator is surrounded by mountains, a harsh sun, and a winding road that all present a formidable physical challenge.

The mountains, in particular, serve as a form of mental torment that hinders the cyclist’s progress. The narrator is repeatedly reminded of the tough terrain as he progresses, combating a simultaneous feeling of despair and hope. The gleaming sun overhead is also a double-edged sword for the cyclist, with its beauty bringing a sense of awe and its intensity creating an oppressive environment.

The winding road, meanwhile, serves as an ever-present reminder of the narrator’s ultimate goal. Although he struggles to find the motivation to continue with each tiny step, the hope of reaching the finish line keeps him going. Furthermore, the winding road allows him to take in the beauty of his environment and appreciate the journey he is on.

Ultimately, the features of the setting that are presented in the poem create a difficult but rewarding experience
