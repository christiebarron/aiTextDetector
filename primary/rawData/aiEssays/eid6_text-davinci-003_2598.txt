The Empire State Building is a iconic building known around the world for its architecture and immense size. It was also equipped with a mooring mast, a device designed to allow a dirigible, or large, floating airship, to dock. Considering the challenges that were associated with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, it is impressive that the engineers and builders of the building were able to fulfill their goal.

One of the biggest challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in enabling dirigibles to dock was the sheer weight it had to bear. The mooring mast itself was tall and weighed four tons, and when combined with the additional weight from the dirigible, it put an incredible amount of strain on the building's organization. One of the ways the engineers addressed this problem was by designing the mast to be easily rearranged. This allowed them to make it lighter and less of a burden for the building's structure.

Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the engineering needed to create a receiving platform that could safely land dirigibles. To create this platform, the engineers had to construct two sections. One section consisted of a sturdy platform that allowed the dirigible to come into contact with the mooring mast. The other section was a frame on top of the mast that allowed the dirigible to land and make stops while it was docked. Their design had to consider the size, weight and structure of the dirigible as it related to the structure of the Empire State Building.

Due to the complexity of the task, the engineers worked with an aer
