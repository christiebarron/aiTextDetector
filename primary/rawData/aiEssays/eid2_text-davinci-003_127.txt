Censorship in libraries is an important issue, and one that must be carefully considered in order for our libraries to remain a place of open access to information and knowledge.

In a public library, where anyone can come to read, borrow, and access information, certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive, profane, or subversive. It would be inappropriate to, in essence, place items in the library that would lead to a hostile environment; this applies to material such as explicit magazines, objectionable books, and movies. Not only would such materials be offensive to many people, but also, libraries are places of education and encouraging healthy discourse when it comes to material, and as such any material that does not meet these criteria should be removed.

It should also be noted that censorship does not always mean a blanket ban on all controversial and offensive material; books, for instance, that contain offensive content but can lead to meaningful and important discussion and debate should not be removed from the library. Instead, libraries have the option to ensure that such materials are properly labeled, indicating their potentially offensive content, in order to temper potential problems.

Overall, libraries must remain places of open access to information and knowledge, but not to the exclusion of our moral boundaries; certain material found to be offensive should be removed from library shelves in order to ensure a safe and healthy learning environment. This is the only way to ensure our libraries remain places where we can freely exercise the right to knowledge and understanding, without fear of hostility and offense.
