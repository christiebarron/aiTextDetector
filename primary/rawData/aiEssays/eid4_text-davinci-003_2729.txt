The poem “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho vividly illustrates the struggles of a student trying to balance her studies and her passion for the natural world. The poem ends with the student reflecting on how she will retest when the winter ends and the natural world starts to bloom again. This idea of perseverance and dedication speaks to the greater importance of life: that taking risks and committing to our passions are worth the potential setbacks.

The poem begins with a girl studying for a very important exam, with little success. Instead of focusing on her studies diligently, she finds the natural world to be a more appealing prospect. She sees that the hibiscus she plants is in a state of winter dormancy, and briefly muses on how it may return in the spring if taken care of. She then refocuses and prepares for her exam the following day.

Though the student ultimately does not pass her test, her dedication to the possibility of receiving a better result in the spring serves as motivation for her to continue. We can see this same dedication in all aspects of life, particularly in the face of failure. It is courage to keep going, even in the face of an unknown future, that is so deeply inspiring.

Furthermore, the poem’s message emphasizes the importance of taking risks and embracing the potential rewards of failure. Even though the student failed to get the outcome she desired, she chose to look on the bright side and persevere. Just as nature takes risks and trusts in the promise of the changing seasons, so too must the student have faith that everything will turn out
