Laughter has always been a special connector between my best friend and me. We have known each other since we were little children and shared so many memories along the way, but the ones that make us both laugh fondly are the ones we connect to the most.

The most memorable moment of all happened last summer when I hosted a barbecue in my backyard. All my friends were there and, of course, my best friend. We were telling funny stories and cracking jokes as the day went on, but it was the moment when a water balloon came flying out of the house that sent us both into fits of laughter. 

To this day, we both still remember it, and it never fails to bring a smile to each of our faces. We were laughing, with tears streaming down our face, and had to stop several times in between to catch our breaths. It was a moment of true friendship and one that I will always cherish.

Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people and moments like this are a reminder of just how special that distance is.
