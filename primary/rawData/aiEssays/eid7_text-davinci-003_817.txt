I remember driving to meet my friends for lunch one day and getting stuck in unbelievable traffic. After twenty minutes, it was obvious I was going to be late. Instead of getting angry, I took a deep breath and stayed calm. 

My friends had already arrived at the restaurant and were waiting for me. When I got there, I apologized for being late and explained what happened. Thankfully, they were very understanding and patient with me. 

My friend even joked and said, “it’s okay, we knew you would get here eventually.” We all laughed, but I was so relieved that they didn’t get mad at me. It was such a great feeling to know that they were so understanding and patient with my situation.
