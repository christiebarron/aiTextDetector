I was recently in the grocery store with my elderly mother. We were in line to check out, and it seemed like the line was taking forever as it was moving quite slowly. I could see the frustration mounting in my mother as we were taking so long, but I resolved to stay calm and find a way to amuse her.

I started making funny jokes and light conversation to distract her from the line, and soon enough we were both laughing. As confusing as the situation was, I managed to remain patient and eventually we finished checking out and made our way back home. I was proud that I kept my cool and kept my mother happy.
