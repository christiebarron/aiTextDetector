Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” is a remarkable poem that paints a vivid picture of a young girl’s struggles and her mother’s attempts to inspire her. The poem ends with the prospect of hope and renewal, as the young girl is determined to try again and take a test in the coming spring when nature is in full bloom.

The author chooses to end the poem with the imagery of a winter hibiscus, symbolizing the young girl’s difficult situation, a journey that is yet to be finished. Through the flower, Ho shows that even in winter, when the cold and snow seem to take control over nature, something beautiful can still thrive and blossom. In the same way, hope and determination can sustain us when times are tough and life feels overwhelming. The spring and the returning birds, though only briefly mentioned in the poem, also contribute to this idea of renewal and awakening. 

The promise of the poem is that even if our current winter is a tough one, we can be confident that the future holds our journey’s completion, if we’re brave enough to take it. The idea of returning to take the test again represents a cycle of learning and self-improvement that doesn’t always end on the first attempt. The ending of this poem encourages individuals to fight the cold and keep looking forward to the possibility of the spring. The poem reflects the concept of being resilient and that, even though the winter season may be long and trying, new beginnings will always come no matter how dark the road may
