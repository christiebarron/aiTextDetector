 

As the sun finally began to set, I wrapped a big scarf around my neck and decided to take a stroll along the river. The fresh air was invigorating, and I felt my spirits rise. I turned a corner and saw my friend perched on a park bench. I laughed out loud when I saw him standing there, smiling as always and wearing his old baseball hat. 

He gestured for me to come and sit beside him, and I gladly obliged. After settling in, we began talking about our day. We talked about mundane things, like work and what had been going on with our families. The conversation flowed easily and soon we were laughing about a silly mistake I had made earlier that day. 

We began to reminisce about our high school days, and even shared a few inside jokes. We laughed so hard that tears were streaming down our faces, and we were soon doubled over in hysterics. It was incredible how quickly we connected with laughter. 

It felt like no matter how much time had passed, the laughter between us was the same as it had always been. When the sun was almost completely set, we said our goodbyes, but not before sharing one last laugh. That night, I went to bed with a smile on my face, grateful for the connection we had made through laughter.
