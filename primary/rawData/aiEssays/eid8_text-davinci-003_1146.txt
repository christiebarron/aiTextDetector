 

I remember it like it was yesterday. I had just completed a huge group project with some of my dearest friends, and all of our hard work had finally paid off. We were all so relieved and grateful that our project was done and it was finally time to celebrate! 

We decided to grab some food and returned to my friend’s house for a few drinks and a bit of a reflection of our achievement over the past few weeks. We all began to laugh and joke about the funny moments during the project and our silly mistakes. The contagious laughter that resonated throughout the room created an undeniable energy. It felt like nothing mattered other than this moment in time. 

At one point, the laughter took a turn and leaned towards a more comical side and we all began to mimic each other’s versions of events that led to the creation of our project. We all looked at each other, eyes wide with surprise and hearts full of love and laughter. 

But the laughter didn't last. It suddenly escaped us, leaving us in a slightly awkward silence. Then, my friend suddenly broke into a fit of laughter, followed quickly by the rest of us, re-establishing the connection between us all. This was probably the most special moment of the evening and one that I will always remember fondly.

It is often said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and on this particular night, I truly felt the power in that statement.
