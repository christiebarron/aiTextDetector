I recently had to wait in line at the bank for what felt like hours. The line wasn't actually that long, but it was moving extremely slowly. I was getting more and more impatient as the wait went on, and I was beginning to get frustrated. Just when I was about to give up and walk out, I remembered a lesson my father had always taught me - to be patient in times of difficulty.

So, instead of giving up, I decided to stay in line and try to be patient. I took a few deep breaths and tried to focus on something calming, like my breathing. After a few minutes, I started to feel a bit better. I wasn't as frustrated as I had been before. Instead of getting angry with the person in front of me for taking so long, I was able to start to empathize with them.

Eventually I made it the front of the line. Even though it had taken a long time, I had managed to stay patient and not let my frustration get the best of me. It felt like a small victory, and I was proud of myself. I learned a valuable lesson that day - that patience can help get you through tough times.
