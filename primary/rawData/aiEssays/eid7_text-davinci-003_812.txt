I was in a long line to buy some groceries, and I was in a hurry because I was running late for work. I had been standing in the line for about twenty minutes, with no movement. There was some commotion at the register, which further added to my worries of being late. Although I was getting increasingly frustrated and anxious, I stayed patient and simply waited. 

Finally, the commotion ended, and the line moved. I was relieved. When everyone finally moved up and I arrived at the register, the cashier was confused. Apparently, they had not been keeping count of the items I had purchased and I had to re-explain them again. Again, despite my worries, I remained patient and calmly explained all the items I had bought. My patience paid off and I was able to leave the store with my groceries in hand, a few minutes later. 
 
I'm glad I managed to remain patient that day. I could have unrealistic expectations and made the situation worse by getting angry, but I stayed positive and patient by staying calm. It resulted in a good outcome, and I was able to go to work on time.
