 

I was out at my favorite lunch spot with a close friend when we spontaneously burst out into laughter. We couldn't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation we found ourselves in. We were both trying to prove that one of us had purchased the wrong drink, and we had both been utterly convinced that the other was wrong. 

We finally both looked at each other and started to laugh, then couldn't stop. All of a sudden, the whole restaurant erupted with laughter, no doubt because we were both being so argumentative and loud. The laughter was infectious and soon everyone was laughing along with us, including the waiter. As we paid our bill and said goodbye to the waiter, he smiled and thanked us for brightening up his day with laughter. 

I was so glad that my friend and I were able to laugh together, even though we had disagreed on something so trivial. We always joke that that's how we changed the atmosphere of the restaurant that day, and now laughter is a common thing between us, reminding us of those silly moments.
