Censorship in libraries has been a long standing issue in many communities. The decision to shelve or remove certain materials from libraries may be a source of heated debate and heated emotions from citizens, parents and government officials alike. As a library patron, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

The library is a cornerstone to the community; it is a safe haven for learning and exploration. Libraries are meant to create an atmosphere that encourages exploration and free thought. It is a public institution and an open platform for opposing viewpoints and ideas. To eliminate certain materials and censor books, music, movies and magazines, would be an infringement on the public’s right to access information. It is censorship, plain and simple. 

Censorship of libraries can have far reaching consequences. Of course some materials may be deemed offensive and deemed unsuitable for younger visitors. It is understandable that there is a need to protect children from harmful or unwanted materials. However, it is the responsibility of the parents and guardians to decide what material is inappropriate for their own children and not the decision of the library or its staff. Furthermore, there are measures that can be taken to protect children from inappropriate materials without resorting to censorship. 

Censorship has long been a tool used to control a population’s access to information. Libraries should be a place of learning, exploration and open-mindedness, not a place of censorship. People are entitled to their own beliefs and opinions but should not be denied access to certain materials
