I still remember it like it was yesterday. I was having dinner with my best friend and her husband at their favourite restaurant. We’d been laughing for ages, swapping stories, having a great time.

Suddenly, out of nowhere, we both started laughing at the same time for no reason at all. Even her husband was taken aback and couldn’t help but crack up too. It was one of those moments where no explanation was necessary – we were just laughing out loud, completely caught up in the moment.

Our laughter was so infectious that it soon spread to the rest of the restaurant, with people turning to look at us and joining in. We couldn’t stop ourselves, and neither could the others around us. It felt like the entire place had joined in on the joke.

That night was so special and it’s a moment I won’t ever forget. Laughter really did bring us all closer, and it reminded me just how powerful it can be in relationships.
