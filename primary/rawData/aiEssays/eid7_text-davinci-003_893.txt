I was recently waiting in a long line at the grocery store, with what felt like a million people in front of me. I was starting to become anxious about how long the wait was and about my other errands that I had to run that day. Despite my growing frustration, I decided to remain patient. I took a few deep breaths and tried to stay calm.

I kept myself distracted by listening to a podcast, singing to myself, and people watching. As the line moved forward, eventually I made it to the cashier. I was relieved that I had stayed patient, and I was able to keep everything else on my to-do list in check.
