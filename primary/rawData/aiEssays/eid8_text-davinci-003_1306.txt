I remember the first time I shared a real laugh with him. We had been friends for what felt like forever, but we'd never actually laughed together. He was always so serious and focused on his career but when he was around me, I felt like I could be a little silly, you know? So I decided to take a risk and decided to tell him an absolutely ridiculous joke about two superheros and an evil villain. 

At first he just stared at me, unsure of what to do. But then, I swear time stopped as he finally cracked a smile and started to laugh. It was the most beautiful sound I had ever heard, and I felt this overwhelming happiness all around me. We laughed together, tears streaming down our faces, until eventually I put a hand to my stomach and we both just stopped and looked at each other in disbelief.

It was then that I knew there was something special between us. Since that day, laughter has become one of the core components of our relationship. No matter how far apart we may be, as long as laughter binds us, our connection will remain strong.
