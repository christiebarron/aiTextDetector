I’ll never forget the day my best friend and I had a “laugh-off”. It doesn’t seem so funny now, but at the time it was the funniest thing ever.

It started off as a normal day, but soon we found ourselves in a competitive competition to see who could make the other one crack up the most. We must have done this for over an hour, taking turns trying to make each other laugh with funny jokes and stories. We would go back and forth, trying to outdo the other one with our silliness. No matter how hard we tried, we couldn’t outdo each other. We barely even spoke; it was just us two, laughing and having a great time. It’s a moment that we’ll never forget. 

That laugh-off is what brought us even closer than we already were. It established a bond between us that is unbreakable. That moment of laughter created a true friendship between us that we still have to this day. 

Laughter truly is the best medicine, and it can create amazing relationships between two people. That day was a reminder of how important it is to just sit back, laugh together and enjoy being together with someone special. I’m very blessed to have that person in my life.
