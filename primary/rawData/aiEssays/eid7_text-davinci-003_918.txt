I was recently at the grocery store and the person in front of me was having problems with their credit card. Not only was their card not working, but it seemed like the cashier had never seen someone use a card like it before. I could tell the person in front of me was getting frustrated, but I forced myself to remain patient and calm. I tried to help out by sharing my knowledge of the card and offering assistance whenever I could. 

I think it took about 15 minutes for the transaction to complete, but I stayed patient the entire time, moving down the line and waiting patiently for my chance to check out my items. Finally, the transaction was finished and the person could leave without feeling embarrassed. I was reminded of how important it is to be patient, even when it isnâ€™t easy, and I feel like I learned a valuable lesson that day.
