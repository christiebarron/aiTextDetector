The construction of the Empire State Building, completed in 1931, had the ambitious goal of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the top of the structure. However, due to the extraordinary challenges and obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, this ultimate vision failed to become a reality.

The initial plan was to build a 290-foot-long mooring mast atop the building, which would serve as a dock to the dirigibles. The mast was to be constructed of a strong enough material that could withstand the force of the airship as it landed, but also light enough so as not to cause heavy damage to the building due to its immense weight. Steel was determined to be the most suitable material but this caused another set of problems, as the mast would need to be reinforced with extra support and bracing that the building itself couldn’t provide due to the mast’s unusual shape and size.

The next challenge was to determine a way to safely attach the mooring mast to the building without causing severe damage to both the mast and building. The builders attempted to devise a plan in which they could embed the mast into the building’s frame in such a way as to allow the airship’s engine to dock safely, but the inability to fulfill this engineering feat proved to be too difficult.

The greatest challenge of all, however, was locating a dirigible with the capacity to safely land at the top of the Empire State Building. Due to the height of the building and the weight of the mast, any dirigible attempting the feat would
