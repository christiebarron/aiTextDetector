I remember the time when I was helping my friend move out of his apartment. It was a hot day in the middle of summer and we were both exhausted. There was so much to do and so little time. We were moving boxes, furniture and appliances from the seventh floor to loading dock, but the elevator was broken. We had no choice but to make the long trek up and down the stairs multiple times. It couldn't have been more uncomfortable carrying those heavy items, but I never complained. I could see how much stress he was under trying to get things done from his lease agreement, finding a new place to live and making sure he had collecting all his things.

I knew it wasn't an ideal situation, but I was determined to be positive and help him as much as I could. After working together consecutively for almost four hours, we finally finished. I was exhausted, my shirt was soaked in sweat, but I was so proud of us for getting things done. My friend made sure to thank me repeatedly for my patience. I was happy to lend a hand and see him through the moving process.
