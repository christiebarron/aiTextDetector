Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, captures a uniquely melancholic yet hopeful tone, one that is reflective and contemplative in nature. By tracing his ancestry and tracing the footsteps of his family’s past and present, Rodriguez is able to create a poignant atmosphere derived from achingly intimate, yet vivid descriptions of the places, people, and moments he recounts.

The memoir is crafted with a sense of nostalgia, an admiration for his home and its culture, and a longing for a shared understanding and appreciation of life’s complexities. In the opening, Rodriguez writes, “As a boy, I was homesick: for the chirping of crickets as they plotted their courses in the night sky; for the sweet scent of jasmine in the thick of a summer’s heat; for the promise of food simmering in the same old pot.” Through this description, he implies a sense of comfort and familiarity, a connection to his home in spite of distance. 

The language and imagery he uses seems to lend its own type of solace to the reader, as if they are sharing in this journey with him. At times, his writing carries a heavy and regretful tone, such as when he mentions the death of his grandfather, revealing an intense sadness that he was unable to be present. But in spite of this, Rodriguez provides a sense of perseverance and resilience, as if he has overcome what he calls an “invisible wall” that has kept his family away from one another for years.
