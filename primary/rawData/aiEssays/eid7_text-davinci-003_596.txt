I recently encountered a situation that really put my patience to the test. I was in line at my local grocery store and the person in front of me had an extraordinary amount of coupons and was having difficulty trying to sort through them. I waited patiently as the cashier and customer went through a long process of verifying each coupon and counting the items in the cart. 

I could feel myself becoming more and more frustrated as time went on but I managed to remain composed and patient. I thought to myself, “It’s never easy trying to sort through all of these coupons and the customer is doing their best.” After what felt like an eternity, the transaction was complete and I was finally able to be checked out. 

Seeing the other customers in line start to grumble and give impatient looks reminded me that it wasn’t easy for anybody. However, my patience was rewarded as the cashier praised me for my understanding and thanked me for being so patient and understanding. I smiled and went on my way feeling proud of my accomplishment.
