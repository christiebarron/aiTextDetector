Over the 86-year history of the Empire State Building, one of the most iconic engineering feats of the 20th century, the prospect of dirigibles docking at this skyscraper has been a topic of great interest. Although the plans were never realized, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock can be found in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The main obstacle cited in the essay is the high winds around the Manhattan skyline, which would make dirigible mooring difficult. The Empire State Building is located in an area where the wind is particularly gusty, which means that it would be dangerous for a dirigible to attempt to maneuver into the mast in such conditions. Even if the mast was designed to stand up against high winds, the dirigible’s large size and air pressure would make accurate mooring difficult. Even if the winds were calm enough for a dirigible to dock, guidance systems would have to be installed in the mast to keep it properly aligned.

The issue of the Empire State Building’s height was another concern. The highest the building ever reached was 1,250 feet and the mast would need to be strong enough for the dirigibles to dock. Its height and the possibility of mechanical failure on the dirigibles created a risk of extensive damage to the mast or the building if a crash occurred. 

The final concern was the cost of the mooring mast. Construction of the mast and its necessary support systems would have been very expensive, and this could have
