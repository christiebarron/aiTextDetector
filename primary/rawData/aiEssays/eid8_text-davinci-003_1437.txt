I was having a night out with my best friend and we were both desperate for a good laugh. After dinner, we went to a local comedy show and were having a great time. The first comic started his routine and we were cracking up. His jokes were so silly and his delivery was spot on. We laughed for so long our stomachs hurt when it got to the end.

The second comic came on and his jokes were a bit darker and more off the beaten path. He made some innuendos that made me blush and his line delivery was so spot on that it left my best friend and I in stitches. We laughed so hard we could hardly take in what he was saying. I was snorting and barely able to breathe. 

My best friend and I couldn't stop laughing for a good solid five minutes and I'm sure we were the loudest ones in the room. Everyone around us was smiling and the two comics thanked us for our enthusiasm.

It felt amazing to just let go and really laugh like that. Everything became real and present, and however briefly, we were connected. We walked out of the show with sore stomachs and broad grins on our facesâ€”laughter had been the bridge between us.
