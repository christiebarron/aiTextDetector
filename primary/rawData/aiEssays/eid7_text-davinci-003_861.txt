I remember a time when I was at the airport. I was rushing to catch my flight, but there were a ton of people in the way. Some were standing still trying to figure out where they were, while others were slowly making their way to their gates. I was getting very frustrated with the amount of people blocking my way, but I chose to be patient.

I kept my cool and focused on my goal. With soft music playing in my headset and my bag thrown over my shoulder, I began to carefully maneuver around people. I had to take many steps to the side and even back track a couple times, but I kept my patience.

Finally I made my way to the gate and had almost a few minutes left to spare. I was so relieved and made it in time, so I took a moment to be thankful and to recognize that if I had not remained patient, I may not have caught my flight.
