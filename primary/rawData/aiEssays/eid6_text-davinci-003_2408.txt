The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their intent to construct a docking station for airships (otherwise known as dirigibles) on the spire of their building in 1930. The most significant of these obstacles was the inherent difficulty of designing an airship dock capable of withstanding the conditions of a bustling city at the time, such as high winds and unpredictable weather.

This problem was addressed by the building's revolutionary design of a mooring mast: an ingenious sixteen-story steel and aluminum structure engineered to withstand the turbulence of the city, and to accommodate docking by even the largest dirigibles known at the time.

Another major dilemma for the designers of the docking platform was ensuring the mast would be able to remain upright and secure even when moored. While engineering drawings illustrated how to anchor the mast to the building using guy-wires, the riders of the dirigibles had to be confident in the mast’s structural stability for the task of successfully navigating a landing.

Additionally, an area of unresolved complexity for the project surrounded the logistics of passengers disembarking directly from the ship onto the observation deck of the building, which involved not only figuring out how to load the dock with visitors and their luggage, but also the hurdle of selecting a suitable entrance at the foot of the mast.

These three points aside, a further issue of particular importance to the project was that of the mast’s own aesthetics. Many people at the time believed the addition of such hardware to the spire of the Empire State Building was detracting from the beauty of the building itself.
