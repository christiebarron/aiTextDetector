I recently had to wait five hours for an appointment which was very frustrating. I wanted to keep busy so I decided to take a detour to the local library and spend my time there. As I entered the library, I was met with long queues of people waiting patiently to get inside. I realized it would take me another hour or two to get in. I was tempted to leave, but I decided to stay in line and wait my turn. 

I noticed the library staff working extremely hard to help everyone as quickly as possible, but with many of us waiting patiently in line, they had a difficult task. They didn't get a break, yet remained professional and polite as they dealt with each customer. Despite the long wait, they never lost their patience or became irritable, which was really inspiring.

After a few hours, my wait was over and I was finally able to enter the library. As I walked in, I saw the library staff smiling and thanking all the customers for their patience.  I was so happy that I was able to witness the great example of patience that the library staff had set for us all. Their dedication and kindness was inspiring and encouraged me to remain patient in other situations throughout my day.
