The Empire State Building was designed to be more than just a tall structure; its inclusion of a mooring mast for dirigibles was a pioneering feat intended to revolutionize travel. However, the builders of this iconic landmark faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, as documented in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book 'The Mooring Mast'. 

First, constructing the mooring mast was no easy task. At 80 stories, the Empire State Building was one of the tallest buildings in the world when it was built, so the mooring mast needed to be made to the same exacting standards. It had to be securely anchored to the structure, as the dirigible ropes could be as heavy as 70 tons. The mast needed to be strong, as the steel structure had to withstand the pressure of the dirigibles when they were mooring, and the pull of the wind when they left. Additionally, engineers had to make sure they could build an access platform to the roof of the building so that passengers could disembark safely. 

The engineers also had to devise a system to dispense fuel and provide power to the dirigible. Piping and wiring had to be installed in the mast, and storage tanks of fuel had to be built on the roof as well. There was also the challenge of installing artificial lighting so the dirigibles could find the mast in the evening. 

Finally, the process of mooring the dirigibles had to be carefully choreographed. An experienced pilot was necessary, as the dirigibles had to move close to
