I was in the supermarket the other day, when all of a sudden I heard a loud crash. I looked to my left and saw a woman has spilt her entire trolley load of groceries. She had quite a few items in her trolley and it looked like a real mess.

Without hesitating I immediately offered to help the woman. She thanked me, but told me that I didn't have to help as it was her fault that it happened. I could tell she was feeling embarrassed and could have been feeling a little overwhelmed in trying to clean up the mess.

I just smiled and said that it's not a problem, I'm happy to help. Even though it was quite late and she was probably in a rush, I gently collected all the items into 2 bags and told her that I'm going to repack them after I finish my shopping.

She thanked me for being so kind and patient. She also asked for my name so that she could pay me for helping her, but I was happy to help her out for free and just asked her to pass on the favor to someone else.

It was nice to put a smile on her face; I know it can be hard for some people to stay patient in difficult situations. So although it took a bit more of my time, I was glad to help her out and show her some kindness.
