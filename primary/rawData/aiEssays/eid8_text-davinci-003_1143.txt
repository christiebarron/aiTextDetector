I was out at dinner with my best friend, who I haven't seen in a while, and we were both trying so hard to catch up on everything we had missed. We were laughing and joking around like old times, but the conversation had gotten a little too serious and the mood felt a little heavy. All of the sudden, my friend burst into an impromptu rendition of our old favorite song. I started laughing so hard that tears rolled down my face. It was such a silly moment and it felt like time had suddenly stopped for us as we relived a funny memory—together. It felt good to be laughing together again and to feel that connection between us that only laughter can bring. It was like a warm hug, and it was enough to lighten the mood and lift the weight off of our shoulders. We ended up talking the night away and it was one of the most enjoyable nights I had in a long time—all thanks to a little bit of laughter.
