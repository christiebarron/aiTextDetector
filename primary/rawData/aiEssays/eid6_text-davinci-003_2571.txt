The building of the Empire State Building in the early 20th century was a feat of engineering, but the challenge of incorporating an airship docking station was a difficult endeavor for the engineers. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast,” the complicated saga of how the builders overcame the obstacles in order to make airships and dirigibles dock safely is chronicled.

The main challenge engineers faced was providing the airships and dirigibles with a secure place to attach. The engineers wanted to add a large steel mast and create a procedure to allow the ships to moor and keep the mast steady in the face of high winds that would affect the Empire State Building. A mooring cable for the mast would need to be created and installed to keep the ships and crew safe.

The chief engineer for the project, Major William E. Fitzroy, devised and tested a dozen possible designs until he finally settled on one with two large cables running the entire length of the mast. Each cable had 3,000 steel strands within to provide the necessary stabilization. An air sock and a release device were also added. In order to make sure the mast could withstand a high wind, the cables were tested by emitting a pressure blast through a nozzle that could equal a wind gust of 100 mph. The final design was also able to be incorporated into the design of the building’s exterior, adding to the already impressive sight.

In the end, the engineers succeeded in allowing the first dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building in October 1931 and marked the hotel as one
