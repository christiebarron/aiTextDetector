Dear Editor, 

Todayâ€™s world is full of technology, and computers are making our lives easier by providing us with infinite sources of information and convenience. But with the good comes the bad, and the effects of computer use on people and society have been hotly debated in the recent years.

I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They help us stay connected with other people around the world and have shrunk the distance between us. We are also able to access a vast array of knowledge and resources that were not available before. Additionally, computer use can be beneficial for productivity, since we are able to easily manage tasks and projects, organize our data, and keep track of our progress. This is especially useful for businesses and students, who can stay immensely organized thanks to the advantages of computer technology.

Lastly, computers have the potential to be used for educational purposes in the form of e-learning, which is an incredible asset to modern students and teachers. From elementary to college classes, teachers are experimenting with computer-based instruction in order to engage students, give them more self-paced options, and make learning more fun and rewarding.

In conclusion, computers are an extremely powerful tool that can benefit both individuals and society in numerous ways. Therefore, I believe that we should embrace the power of computers, as they are a stepping stone to further progress and advancements. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
