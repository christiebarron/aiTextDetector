The freedom to access information is a crucial part of a healthy and functioning society. Libraries provide the public with one place to go to get access to this information. Therefore, it is essential that libraries remain places of unbiased and comprehensive access to knowledge.

Censorship in libraries is a slippery slope that can leave libraries restricted in the materials available to their patrons. While I understand that some patrons may find materials offensive, it is a libraryâ€™s responsibility to provide the public access to all types of information, regardless of personal beliefs. When material is removed due to offense, it limits our access to information and can be used to suppress thought and dialogue. To censor material is to impede intellectual inquiry, which is the basis of a thriving society.

Moreover, it is important to remember that censorship is often used to preserve the status quo by keeping marginalized voices from having their stories heard. We must stand firmly against any attempts at censorship in order to protect our right to information and to support the voices of those who are least heard.

For these reasons, I urge you to support free and open access to information in our libraries. Censorship of materials should be disciplined and put into context rather than completely removed from the shelves. Let us remember that book burning is never the answer; it is our responsibility to explore and debate ideas, even those that are controversial. We must provide everyone with the opportunity to access information and build their own understanding of the world.
