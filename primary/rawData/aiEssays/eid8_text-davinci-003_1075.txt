I remember fondly the day my brother and I had a good chuckle. We were recently in the car, our usual means of transportation, when my brother, Jared, decided to try out a few impressions. He had been practicing them for weeks and was determined to get one right. 

I must admit, his timing wasn't the best. He started off by doing an impression of our aunt, who we had seen only a few days prior. His attempt was borderline painful, but I didn't want to discourage him, so I kept a straight face. 

But then he moved on to something much better. He did an impression of one of our neighbors, who always has a gruff demeanor. Jared had done his research, and he hit it out of the park. His nasal inflection, facial expressions, and gruff attitude were spot-on! 

I couldn't help it - I started laughing hysterically. Jared saw the humor in it too, and we both enjoyed a good laugh at the neighbor's expense. We still laugh about it to this day and the memory will be with us forever.
