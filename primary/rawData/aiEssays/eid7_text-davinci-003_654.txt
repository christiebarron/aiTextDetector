I recently encountered a situation where I had to be patient. My family and I had planned to go on a road trip and my sister and I were both so excited to go. On the day of the trip however, my sister woke up not feeling well. She had a fever and spent most of the day in bed. Though I was disappointed, I decided not to let my emotions get the best of me. I knew she needed rest, so I remained patient and understanding.

I spent the day doing some chores that needed to be done around the house as well as catching up on some of the reading I had been wanting to do. When night came, I was relieved to see my sister feeling better and we were able to start the road trip the next day. Because I was patient, I was able to enjoy the trip with my family without discord.
