I am always struck by how much closer it makes me feel to my husband. We always joke about how our laughter comes so quickly in conversation and how weird it looks to outside observers, but there's just something about it that brings us together in a special way.

Today, my husband was telling me about a funny incident that happened at work, which in the moment I didn't think was particularly interesting. But then he suddenly changed the way he was telling it, adding a few key details that made it really funny. I found myself bursting out into uncontrollable laughter and before I knew it, my husband was joining in. We were both laughing so hard that tears were rolling down our faces.

In that moment we were both so in sync and just enjoying each other's company. The moment was amazing and our laughter echoed through the house. It was like a reminder that the little things can still bring us joy and unite us when we're laughing together. I wouldn't trade those moments for anything.
