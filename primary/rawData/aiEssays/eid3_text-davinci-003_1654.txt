The features of the setting in the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski have a great impact on the cyclist in the poem. The lack of flat ground sets an interesting challenge for the cyclist as he climbs up a steep hill. The cyclist must overcome the challenge presented by the landscape in order to experience the feeling of accomplishment.

The fact that the road is rough also affects the cyclist. The rigid terrain and rocky surface present an additional obstacle to the cyclist, making it harder to go fast and further complicating the challenge of getting to the top. Moreover, the physical exertion and mental concentration required by the cyclist in order to navigate the rough road ahead is intense, adding to the difficulty of getting up the hill.
