I was on a field trip with my close group of friends to a nearby beach and we were all having the best time taking silly pictures in the sand, running around and playing volleyball. We had been there for a couple of hours and were getting tired; we decided it was time to head back and get some rest. 

As we were walking, a small group of clumsy seagulls caught our attention and we started playing around and chasing each other. One of my friends, Travis, made a joke and as soon as he did, we all burst out laughing. Before long, we were all howling with laughter and no matter how hard we tried to catch our breath, the giggles kept coming. 

It was one of those moments that seemed to last forever and the sound of laughter rolling off the shore and across the beach was just magical. I remember feeling so close to my friends in that moment, almost as if I was a part of them. After all the laughter had died down and our stomachs ached from the amount of laughing we had done, we all swapped hugs and parted ways.

It was that moment that I learned the power of laughter in a relationship. Laughter can bring people together and create such strong bonds. It showed me that sometimes, laughter can be just as powerful as anything else.
