I was sitting with my best friend, Gabriel, in his living room. We were discussing a rather serious topic. We had been debating for a while and the atmosphere was getting a bit tense, so I decided to make a joke to lighten the mood. I said, "I never make the same mistake twice, and in fact, I just made it again!" 

We both burst out laughing and suddenly the whole room was filled with warmth and relief. We ended up laughing for what felt like an eternity. After we had calmed down, Gabriel said, "Wow, it feels good to laugh like that. I needed this!" I agreed, and soon we were back on the same topic, but this time we discussed it in a much more amicable and understanding way. 

Laughter had been the bridge that allowed us to come to a better understanding of the situation. All it took was one funny joke to melt away all the tension, and bring us much closer together. I was grateful to laughter for helping us reach a common ground.
