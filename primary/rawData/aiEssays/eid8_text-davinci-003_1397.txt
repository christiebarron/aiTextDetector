I remember it like it was yesterday. I was in seventh grade, and the boy I had a crush on sat at the front of the classroom. We had always had this strange connection, ever since we first met in the sixth grade. All day, I would sit in the back and try to get his attention with silly looks and faces, and often I would catch his eye. 

On this particular day, however, I was feeling particularly embarrassed by my bold advances, so instead of engaging him I chose to focus on taking diligent notes from the teacher's lesson. But when I looked up from my paper, I noticed he had situated his desk to face in my direction, and was staring intently at me. He then smiled and his eyes lit up as if he was daring me to do something. 

Instantly, I knew exactly what I had to do. I nervously returned his smile, but slowly it began to grow bigger and bigger until I started to laugh uproariously. His smile eventually joined mine, and before long we were both laughing in joy. It felt like a little spark had flown between us, and the laughter felt like a secret little language that we shared with no one else.

From that day on, we would often exchange these mischievous glances and I would find myself soon bursting into fits of laughter. Even thinking back on it now, it's something that brings a wide grin to my face. It was like our own special secret - something only the two of us shared.
