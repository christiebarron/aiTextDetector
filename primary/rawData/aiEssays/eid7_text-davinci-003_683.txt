I remember a time when I was standing in line at the grocery store, and the customer in front of me was having a difficult time. They were having a hard time understanding the checkout process, and were talking to the cashier about it in a very confused and frustrated tone. Even though I was in a rush, I took a deep breath and simply waited patiently. I could feel the annoyance bubbling up inside me, but I chose to be understanding and tolerant of their situation.

Eventually, the customer worked out what was going on, and I was able to check out after them. Even though I may have been irritated by the whole situation, I'm proud of myself for staying patient and understanding during that moment in time. Patience is an important virtue, and I'm glad I was able to practice it in that particular situation.
