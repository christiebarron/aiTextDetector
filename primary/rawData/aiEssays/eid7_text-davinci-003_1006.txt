I have a strong passion for travel, so when I heard about the limited vacation days my company allowed, I was initially disappointed. But then I decided to focus on the positive things that I already had. I tried to be patient and creative to maximize my time off.

That summer, I decided to take a circuitous route to visit both of my parents who lived elsewhere. I used my vacation time for extended weekends, and tried to get the most out of each journey. I scheduled my flights and accommodations carefully, and thankfully had plenty of friends and relatives to stay with during my travels.

Not everything during my trip went according to plan - delays, cancellations, and stormy weather were just some of the things that tried my patience. But I kept my spirits up. I read books and listened to music that kept me distracted, and was sure to thank the people who helped make my trip possible. 

When I arrived home after my travels, although I was exhausted, I felt a strong sense of fulfillment. I had managed to make the most of my vacation days, and although I still wish I had more days off, I took away a feeling of patience and gratitude as my biggest lesson.
