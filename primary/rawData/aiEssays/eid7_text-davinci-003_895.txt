I recently visited my grandmother in her assisted living home. She is getting up there in age and her health is slowly declining. We exchanged stories and I could tell she was getting tired. I could see the effort it took for her to stay with us and even fight the sleepiness. After a few hours of visiting, I realized I should have been checking the time more often. We had nearly gone a couple hours past our expected time, but Grandma didn't complain once. In fact, she encouraged us to keep visiting and encouraged stories from everyone. As I realized the time I was a little embarrassed but very grateful for her patience and understanding. She was so gracious and had such a wonderful attitude about the whole thing. I know she didn't want us to go, and she was patient enough to let us visit as long as we wanted to. It was a wonderful reminder to me of the importance of being patient and understanding, no matter the circumstances.
