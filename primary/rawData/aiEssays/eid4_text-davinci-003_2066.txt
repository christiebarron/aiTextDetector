Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” is a moving story of an immigrant student’s journey. In the poem, the student is deeply homesick and overwhelmed by the struggles of assimilating into a foreign culture and language. The final line of the poem, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” is a powerful conclusion that conveys the protagonist’s determination to never give up.

The symbolism behind this line is a symbolism of hope. Just as the snow melts and the geese return to symbolize the coming of spring, the protagonist’s determination to take the test again symbolizes their resilience in the face of change and hardship. The use of the hibiscus bud also represents the protagonist’s hope for a fresh start and new opportunities. The imagery implies that the protagonist’s struggles will be worth it, and that the changes they have experienced will blossom just like the hibiscus.

By ending with the metaphor of the hibiscus bud, Ho conveys a powerful message of hope and resilience. The protagonist is determined to persevere, no matter what obstacles they face. The imagery of the hibiscus serves to remind us that, while persevering through change might be difficult, there is always the chance that something wonderful can grow if we are patient and determined. Through the metaphor of the hibiscus, Ho magically infuses the poem with hope
