The Empire State Building, which stands proud at 1,250 feet in midtown Manhattan, was once home to a docking station for dirigibles. This docking station was seen as a symbol of progress and imagination, but the challenges of constructing such a unique system were complex and diverse. This essay will look to understand the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The major obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building encountered was the engineering challenge that dirigibles present. Unlike airplanes and helicopters, which can land at minor airports, dirigibles require a large, open space in order to land safely. The Empire State Building was no exception; the builders needed to create a docking station that could accommodate the size and structure of the large dirigible. An extremely lengthy and difficult design process was necessary to create a unique structure that could provide the safety and security required.

In order to construct a completely safe docking station, builders had to design a system that would allow secure mooring in all weathers. The Empire State Building had two major mooring masts to help with the task. The first mast was the Central Mast, which was made from steel and was provided by the Manhattan Port Authority before the Empire State Building was even built. This was one hundred and fifty feet tall and equipped with a variety of arms and platforms to secure the dirigible dirigible. The second mast was the Overhead Mast, which was constructed on top of the building and provided an extra level of security. Finally, two sets of specially designed railings were placed along the sides of the building
