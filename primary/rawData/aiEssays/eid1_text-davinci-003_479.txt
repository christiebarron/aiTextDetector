As technology advances, computers have become an integral part of our lives. From communication to entertainment, it seems computers are everywhere, but the effects they have on us can be great or small depending on usage.

In my opinion, the overall connotation of computers is positive. Computers drastically reduce the amount of time required to complete mundane tasks, allowing us to spend time doing more enjoyable activities. They also provide an infinite source of entertainment and knowledge, from movies and music to online classes and tutorials.

On the flip side, some negative effects of computers can arise when people become too dependent on them. For some, gaming can become so intense that it interrupts other areas of their lives, such as school and social interaction. Too much computer use could even lead to physical ailments such as carpal tunnel syndrome and vision problems.

Overall, computers can have great positive effects when used effectively. With proper use and moderation, computers can be a great asset to anyone's life. The trick is to remember that computers are there to serve us, not the other way around. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
