Laughter has always been a comfort to me; it's a language that needs no translation. One unique example of laughter's power came just yesterday.

I met a woman in a small town outside of the city who was visiting from Spain. Her English was very broken and conversing felt awkward and clunky, but we still managed to make a connection. Whenever she smiled and chuckled at my attempts to speak Spanish, I could sense a connection being built between us, even without many words. We exchanged stories of our travels and her broken English mixed with hand gestures to make the conversation light and humorous.

At one point I blurted out a pretty bad Spanish phrase and the woman couldn't contain her laughter. We both shared a good, loud laugh, it felt true and real. In that moment, I knew that there was something genuinely special between us, something beyond language barriers. I never expected to make such a connection with a traveler in a small town in Spain.

At the end of the conversation, we embraced and she kissed me on the cheek. She walked away with a wide smile on her face and I still feel the joy and warmth of that moment. It's a reminder that laughter, more than anything, has the power to bring people closer together.
