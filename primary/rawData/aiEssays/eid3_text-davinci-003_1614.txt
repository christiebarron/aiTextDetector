The features of the setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski affect the cyclist in a variety of ways. The most important factor is the terrain along the route that the cyclist has chosen; the map shows the road being both winding and mountainous. The winding roads can cause the cyclist to lose their balance in the event of an unexpected turn or a sharp corner. Mountainous terrain further adds to the challenge of the ride, as some areas require the cyclist to push his bike up a steep slope and other areas may be too treacherous for the bike to traverse safely.

The cyclist is also affected by the elements of the weather within the setting. The unpredictable and often inclement weather experienced along the route can affect the cyclist’s visibility and their overall endurance. High winds or rainfall can make cycling even more difficult, as the cyclist will have to work harder to keep their speed, balance and momentum.

The cyclist is also affected by the wildlife that inhabits the area. The presence of wildlife can be seen as a distraction, as the cyclist must maintain concentration to avoid any possible surprises that may appear along the route. The cyclist must remain aware of the potential dangers of wild animals or other unpredictable factors
