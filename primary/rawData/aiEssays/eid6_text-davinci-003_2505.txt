Few accomplishments stand as a testament to the engineering and design prowess of the early twentieth-century United States as the Empire State Building. However, one remarkable aspect of the famous structure has been largely forgotten - its capacity to accommodate dirigibles, the enormous airships of the day. In the 1930s, the engineers of the Empire State Building had to grapple with a formidable challenge before the dirigible dock could be realized - constructing a mooring mast tall enough and strong enough to securely berth the behemoths of the skies. 

The task before the Empire State Building engineers was herculean. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast, “Dirigibles were far bigger and heavier than any aircraft that had ever been built” and so docking them required a far sturdier infrastructure than any mere aerodrome. The mooring mast had to be constructed of the highest-grade steel and be tall enough to accommodate the behemoths but also robust enough to effectively lock them in place. It was a difficult balancing act to engineer the structure with maximum security without sacrificing the necessary height. 

At 1,250 feet tall, the massive mast had to exceed the Empire State Building’s main architecture by some 400 feet. It was erected using a special ‘Cantilever’ technique, involving the dropping and welding of pre-fabricated steel girders in a precise sequence. After days of careful work and engineering, the mooring mast was ready for its first dirigible - the U.S.S. Los Angeles
