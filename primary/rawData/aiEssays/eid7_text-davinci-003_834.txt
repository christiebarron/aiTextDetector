Not too long ago, I had volunteered to help out at a project close to my heart - helping out inner-city kids with their school work. I was really excited to get started, and I knew it would be a great experience, but I had no idea that it'd take so much out of me. 

We had a lot of kids that we needed to help, and sometimes the project had more requests than what we could handle. It got to a point where I had to put in at least 20 hours a week just to make sure that all the kids were getting what they needed. It was exhausting for me, but I had seen how desperately the kids needed help, and I was determined to do more. 

At times, I got frustrated and wanted to give up, but I knew that the children were depending on me. I kept reminding myself that their future was more important than my own exhaustion, and so I kept going despite the fatigue. I kept my focus on the main goal, and I was able to stay patient as I worked. 

By the end of the project, all of my efforts had paid off. The kids had started to make significant educational progress, which was so gratifying to see. Even though it had been hard, I realized how important it was to stay patient and brave through the projects. Being patient had allowed me to give back to the kids who needed it most.
