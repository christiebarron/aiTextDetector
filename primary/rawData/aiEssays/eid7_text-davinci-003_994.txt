I was recently out for a walk with my dad and he got his foot caught in some unruly weeds. As I started to help him out and started feeling frustration about the situation, I took a deep breath and reminded myself to be patient. Instead of getting angry, I calmly worked to untangle his foot, gently lifting it up in order to free it. Finally, after a few long moments, his foot was released and we continued our walk. I was proud of myself for taking the time to calmly and patiently solve the problem, instead of letting my frustration get the best of me.
