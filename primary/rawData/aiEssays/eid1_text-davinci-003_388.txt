Dear Editor,

In today’s digital era, computers have become an integral component of people’s daily lives. As our dependence on technology continues to grow, computers have a growing influence on our society. Some argue that computers are making us more productive, connected, and informed, while others worry about the potential drawbacks of us becoming overly reliant on computers.

In my opinion, there are both positive and negative effects of computers in our lives. On the one hand, computers are widely used for research, communication, and day-to-day transactions. This technology has come to simplify many tasks that we previously had to toil over. Computers have broadened our ability to access information and resources at the touch of a button and this enhances productivity. On the other hand, computers also have a downside that many of us are not comfortable with acknowledging. The overuse of computers creates distraction and decreased attention which can be damaging to our mental health. The disconnection arising from a lack of physical interaction due to reliance on computers could lead to a decrease in emotional intelligence.

I believe that computers should be used in moderation. We should use technology as a tool to become more productive, but should not let it consume us or draw us further away from developing meaningful relationships. Balance is key. With a balanced approach, we can reap the benefits of computers while guarding against their potential pitfalls.
