The building of the Empire State Building in 1930 was an incredible feat of engineering and represented a milestone in the history of skyscrapers. However, it was also a challenge to build a structure that could accommodate another technological marvel at the time, dirigibles, to dock in its well-known mooring mast.

Despite the ambitious goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, there were numerous obstacles that the builders had to address. This began with the structure itself. The mooring mast was one of several unique aspects of the building design; it was constructed from steel I-beams and weighed more than 15,500 pounds. The mast was made strong enough to hold the weight of a dirigible as it suspended from the tower.

The construction of the mooring mast alone wasn't simple. The height of the mast also had to be taken into consideration. At 102 stories tall, the Empire State Building was first in the world for skyscraper height, with the mooring mast topping out at 825 feet. Due to its substantial height, a very stable platform was needed to make it safe for dirigibles to dock. To do this, engineers constructed a retractable girder that bridged the large gap between the top of the building and the mast, in order to create a stabilized walkway 36 feet in length from its top.

The engineers also had to ensure the Empire State Building was equipped with the necessary electrical and mechanical systems to lift the anchor lines used for dirigible docking and landing. This was achieved with the use of connectors and slide hangers
