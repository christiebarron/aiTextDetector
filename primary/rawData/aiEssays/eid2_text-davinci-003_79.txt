Dear Editor of [Newspaper], 

Censorship in libraries is a hot-button issue and is of high importance to the public. The question remains: should certain material, such as books, music, movies, and magazines be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? 

I firmly believe that libraries should not censor materials. Libraries should be a source of learning and exploration. Providing access to controversial books, music, movies, and magazines opens the door to discussion and educational enlightenment. Removing these materials simply results in a lack of valuable knowledge and understanding. 

Removing offensive materials from libraries is a slippery slope. Where does one draw the line? Who decides what is considered offensive and what is not? What about those with varying opinions when it comes to the issue of what constitutes as “offensive”? It is counter-productive to eliminate materials that may be viewed as offensive, as it does not promote discourse on the matter. Censoring these materials merely confines discussion and limits knowledge and understanding.

Specifically, censoring offensive materials in libraries negatively affects research. When researching particular topics, many rely on varied perspectives in order to draw a well-rounded conclusion. Eliminating some resources only serves to skew the research findings. Therefore, censoring offensive materials only hinders both education and exploration. 

In conclusion, censoring materials from libraries is unnecessary and detrimental. Instead, I believe libraries should provide an environment of learning and exploration and spare no resources. To censor these materials is to deny access to valuable knowledge and understanding. 

Sincerely,
