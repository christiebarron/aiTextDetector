The Empire State Building was designed with a vision of allowing dirigibles to dock on its mast at the 102nd floor. Although this plan was never realized, the builders faced numerous obstacles in bringing the vision to fruition.

When the design plan was first announced, many were left incredulous. The challenge of safely docking airships atop an eighty-story skyscraper had never been attempted before. Ultimately, an engineer named Captain George F. Everett was called in to develop the necessary mechanical system for the mooring mast.

Captain Everett faced several obstacles in developing the mooring mast. Among them was the technical issue of designing a system that would both properly stabilize the airships and not be too heavy for the building structure to support. Furthermore, he had to work within the narrow parameters of the existing architecture, which limited the number of workers that could work on the mast at once. He also had concerns about the effect of the vertical drafts on the airships, as well as the effects of wind currents on their maneuverability.

Given the growing abundance of taller buildings in New York City, many people questioned the practicality of having airships dock at such heights. As a result, substantial conversation surrounded the issues of public safety and potential disruption to the downtown traffic below. The public also had to consider the cost of the mast, and the potential liability associated with operating it.

Given the technical, logistical and financial challenges associated with the construction of the mooring mast, the plan was ultimately abandoned. The mechanisms that Captain Everett had developed, however, served as the basis for the plans of other engineers
