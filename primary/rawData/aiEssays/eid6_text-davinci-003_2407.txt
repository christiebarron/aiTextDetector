The Empire State Building was considered a marvel of modern architecture when it was first constructed in 1931. One of its more unique features was a planned mooring mast for dirigibles, the large airships of the era. Though the mooring mast was never used during the Empire State Building’s heyday, it represents an attempt to show the limitless potential of the building.

The idea to build the mooring mast came from Empire State Building architect William Lamb. Lamb was intrigued with the thought of large airships docking at the building, just like they did at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The mast was designed to be a capable docking station, constructed with two levels: a lower area for the ground crew and a higher area for the vessel. Themast was 200 feet high, with two 40 foot towers rising from it, making it the tallest structure in midtown Manhattan.

Despite the enthusiasm for the project, implementing the mooring mast proved to be an enormous challenge. For starters, maintaining the mast was expensive and required a full-time staff of maintenance workers. Additionally, strong winds from the Hudson and East Rivers often made the mooring mast too unstable to use. Furthermore, dirigibles were side tracked by the onset of air travel and the invention of the airplane. Despite the cost and the waning of dirigibles, the mooring mast was a testament to Lamb’s faith in the future of architecture and imagination of the possibilities of flight.

Ultimately, the mooring mast at the Empire State Building was never used. After severe weather damaged the
