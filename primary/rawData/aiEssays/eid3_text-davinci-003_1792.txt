In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays an important role in shaping the outcome of the story.

The setting takes place in a rural area which immediately puts the cyclist at a disadvantage. It is comprised of uneven, unpaved roads with poor visibility because of the dense amount of foliage. This makes it difficult for the cyclist to maneuver the twists and turns without concern for obstacles blocking his vision. The environment is also unaccommodating, with no nearby help or signs offering guidance. 

This lack of convenience and safety further complicates the cyclist's journey as he has to trudge through tall grass and mud in order to avoid disaster.  It also increases his stress as he must be constantly on the lookout for any dangerous creatures that may be lurking in the darkness. 

The cyclist also struggles with the environment's physical toll. The uneven roads, coupled with his inadequate preparation, leaves him vulnerable to physical exhaustion and injury. This is highlighted when he suddenly feels a sharp pain in his ankle, illustrating that even a simple maneuver swiftly becomes a difficult task in such a rough terrain.
