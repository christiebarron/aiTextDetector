The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to make the building suitable for docking dirigibles. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article, “The Mooring Mast,” the designers of the Empire State Building had to take numerous precautions and make difficult decisions in order make their dream a reality.

One of the first challenges designers faced was dealing with the wind. To accommodate the dirigibles, the Empire State Building was designed to be extremely tall in order to prevent turbulence and offer the best visibility for incoming ships. This meant that the building had to be extremely strong and well-engineered, otherwise winds at different altitudes would cause the structure to sway and eventually buckle. The required sturdiness of the building increased the costs for the project drastically.

Another challenge for the designers was the mooring mast itself. This was the metal mast that would be installed at the top of the building from which dirigibles could be secured. Although the mast was very tall, reaching to the top of the building, it was surprisingly lightweight, which helped reduce the stress on the building from heavy gales. The mast was also tremendously strong, as it had to be able to withstand the stress of the mooring lines and any movement of the ships.

The designers also had to take into consideration the safety of those on board the dirigibles. The mooring mast had to be tall enough to be visible to pilots, but also provide ample clearance to prevent too much speed while docking. To make the area safer, engineers added extra searchlights and
