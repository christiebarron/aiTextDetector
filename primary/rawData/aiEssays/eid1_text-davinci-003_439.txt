Dear Editor, 

Today, computers are an integral part of our daily lives. From schools to businesses, to personal use, it is hard to imagine life without computers. While computers undoubtedly offer us a multitude of benefits, there are some drawbacks too.

I believe the biggest impact of computers on people is that they have encouraged us to move into a much more sedentary lifestyle. We rely on computers to do our work, communicate with family and friends, and even perform simple tasks like shopping. This means we are relying on machines instead of using our own physical activities, which can lead to decreased physical health and even obesity. 

Not only do computers encourage us to be less active, but also have a major impact on our mental health. We spend so much time looking at a small blinking screen and staring at a monitor that it leaves us overly stressed, decreases our focus and concentration level, and can even increase the risk of depression. 

For the sake of our health, I urge readers to take action now. Use computers to simplify our lives and make things faster, but make sure to balance their use with exercising and engaging in outdoor activities. Not only will this ensure a healthier lifestyle, but it also stimulates brain activity and creativity among others. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
