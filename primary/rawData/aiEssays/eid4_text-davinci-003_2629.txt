The protagonist’s dedication to keeping the hibiscus alive through the harsh winter reveals a deep connection to her home and family. By using the hibiscus as a symbol of hope, she suggests that even in difficult times, there is still a chance to look to the future with optimism. 

The protagonist clearly understands how difficult it is to endure the losses that life can bring. She labels her determination to keep the hibiscus alive as “craziness” and even admits she could be wrong. Yet, she remains relentless, believing that, if she just hang on, things will eventually get better and the hibiscus will return in the spring.

Her decision to revisit it once the winter is over demonstrates her courage to confront her fears and take control of her life. Despite the adversity, she believes that the coming of spring will bring new opportunities to start again and more likely succeed.
