In today’s world, it’s increasingly important to remember that censorship in libraries is still very much alive and well. From books, to magazines, to movies and music, library shelves contain a plethora of materials that can be seen as offensive by those with differing values or beliefs. Whether or not these materials should be removed from the library shelves is a highly debatable issue that needs to be addressed. 

Censorship should not be used in libraries as a means of moral guardianship. Libraries are a place for discovery and education, where individuals can see different opinions and values without judgment. If certain materials are deemed to be inappropriate and are removed from the shelves, then people cannot explore those avenues of knowledge. The library should instead be a ground for open social and intellectual dialogue. 

Moreover, censorship sets a dangerous precedent. Where should the line be drawn between which materials are deemed suitable for the library and which are not? What happens if a book does not align with one person’s political views? Which materials should library officials pull off the shelves in order to keep the library “clean” and wholesome? Any attempt to do so would be high-handed and restrictive, and would not be beneficial to anyone in the long run. 

It’s important to remember that the library shelves should remain neutral. The library should not be a place to control what is seen and heard, but to enlighten and educate. As such, libraries should be a place of both intellectual freedom and free speech. Censorship should not be used as a tool of moral guardianship
