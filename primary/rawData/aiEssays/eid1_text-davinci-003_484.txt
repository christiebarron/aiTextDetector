Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Computers are ubiquitous in todayâ€™s world, and they are playing an increasingly important role in our lives.

On the one hand, people can use computers to make their lives easier and more convenient. Whether they are engaging in online shopping or conducting important financial transactions, computers provide a quick and secure way to get things done. Moreover, with the availability of the Internet, computers have given people access to an enormous wealth of information that was previously unattainable.

But there are also some negative effects that computers have had on people. Because of the increasing reliance on computers for all kinds of tasks, people are becoming increasingly more dependent on them and less able to take care of everyday tasks on their own. Another concern is that people are now spending more time interacting with computers than with other people, which can lead to social isolation and loneliness.

Overall, it is clear that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. However, if used in moderation, computers can be a useful tool that enhances our lives. I urge readers to think carefully about how they use computers and the effects that it has on their lives.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
