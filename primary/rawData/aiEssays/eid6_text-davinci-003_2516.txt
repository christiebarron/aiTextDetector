The construction of the Empire State Building in31st Street was a major success that included a number of pioneering achievements. One of the most noteworthy of these was the construction of a mooring mast atop the building that allowed for the docking of dirigibles, or what modern people often refer to as airships. Despite being a record-breaking achievement in its day, the project to build this mooring mast also presented some major obstacles to the builders of the Empire State Building.

The first obstacle was the height of the mooring mast itself. At 112 feet, the mooring mast was significantly taller than all of the structures surrounding the Empire State Building, making it more prone to the wind gusts that often buffeted the city. Furthermore, it would need to be strong and stable enough to support the weight of an attached dirigible, which presented additional engineering challenges. The designers and engineers of the mooring mast also had to account for the unique landing requirements of dirigibles, which demanded a kind of predefined navigational approach that could be followed in order to securely attach the vessel to the mast. 

The second obstacle was the financial cost of building the mooring mast and the necessary infrastructure to support it. The mooring mast was an expensive endeavor, and the financiers behind the project had to be convinced that it would be profitable to build it at all. The Empire State Building served as a landmark, but it was also one of the first tallest buildings in the world, which presented additional construction costs, including special measures to ensure the safety of dirigibles in the
