The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” is essential to the story, as it immerses the reader into the struggles of the cyclist. After the cyclist falls down, he realizes he is in the middle of a hot desert, the harshness of which is indicated by its desolate appearance and the extreme midday heat. The expansive, rough terrain he sees further exacerbates his plight, and the cyclist desperately begins to search for any sign of life.

The setting presents a number of obstacles to the cyclist’s quest for safety and shelter. The lack of trees and shelter means that the cyclist is exposed to extreme heat and dangerous animals. As he continues to cycle, he encounters pot-holes, sand-dunes, and rocky terrain, which slow his progress and make the journey even more difficult.

The hostile environment forces the cyclist to rely on his own strength and determination. The heat forces the cyclist to ride at a slower pace, using the shade of rocks or sporadic vegetation for refuge. Despite the challenging circumstances, the cyclist's determination provides a sense of hope and perseverance that allows him to continue his journey.
