I was walking down the street the other day, when I heard the most infectious laughter coming from around the corner. I had to investigate, so I stopped what I was doing, and decided to follow the sound.

As I rounded the corner, I saw the scene before me and it brought a smile to my face. Sitting in the park was an elderly couple, surrounded by a handful of children, who were laughing and having a great time.

The old man had a contagious laugh, and the children were doing their absolute best to make him laugh. One little girl even went so far as to imitate his laugh, and it worked. Suddenly, the old man burst out laughing, even harder than before. The kids lined up and proceeded to tell him a few jokes.

The old man laughed and laughed until his face turned bright red. Meanwhile, the old woman watched with a big smile, content to just have her husband and the children surrounding her.

I smiled to myself and silently gave thanks for being able to witness such a pure moment of joy, before continuing on my way. That moment reminded me why laughter is so important in any relationship â€“ it brings people together in a way little else can, and in this case it had united an elderly couple with a bunch of little kids.
