The building of the Empire State Building was an incredible feat of engineering and construction in its day. One unique feature of the building, however, was its intention to allow dirigibles to dock on the roof. Despite the grand ambition of the project, the endeavor to make the mooring mast a reality posed a number of technical and logistical obstacles. 

The first major obstacle was finding a suitable location for the mooring mast. Because of the sheer height and size of the Empire State Building, high winds posed a potentially grave danger to any dirigible attempting to dock there. This caused engineers to be very cautious in their selection of a viable docking site. After numerous tests and calculations, the 107th floor was eventually selected as it provided the least wind resistance due to its narrow width and flatter profile. 

A second hurdle came in the form of securing adequate funding. Although the cities of New York and Paris wanted the project to go through, they lacked the necessary funds to make it a reality. The feat eventually had to be funded by private investors and due to the potential risks associated with aviation, the funds were difficult to come by.

Thirdly, the Empire State Building was still under construction during the development period of the mooring mast. This presented a number of safety concerns, with the engineers having to manage potentially hazardous building and construction material whilst still ensuring aerodynamic safety.

Finally, the design of the mooring mast presented a stark challenge. With the various mechanical and aerodynamic forces at play, the mooring mast needed to be strong enough to bear the weight of a
