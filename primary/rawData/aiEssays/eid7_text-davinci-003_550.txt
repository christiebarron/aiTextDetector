 

I recently had a difficult experience at the airport. I was traveling with a friend who was late to the gate and almost missed the flight. We made it in time but were not allowed to sit in our seats together. I was frustrated and mad but I chose to be patient. 

I could feel my heart racing and my nerves jangling, but I took some deep breaths and told myself to remain calm. I was annoyed, but I knew that getting angry and lashing out would just make the situation more difficult. 

So instead, I smiled politely and explained the situation to the flight attendant. I was honest about our mistake but said that I really hoped we could stay seated together. 

The flight attendant was unyielding - no changes allowed. I could see that she wasn’t going to budge, so I accepted the situation. Even though I was feeling stressed and upset, I was determined to remain patient and to not make a scene. 

In the end, we rushed to board and made it to our seats - but they weren’t next to each other. It was a difficult situation, but I am proud that I responded with patience.
