The Empire State Building was an ambitious project from the get-go, with the ultimate goal to make New York City the premier destination for air travelers. The plan was to expand the city's skyline even further by creating a mooring mast atop the building, at a height of 1,000 feet, to be used by dirigible airships to dock. Despite this ambitious plan, there were a number of obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

First and foremost, they had to find an efficient way to store and secure the airships once they had landed. The mooring mast had to be strong and durable, but also capable of providing a perfect grip. After much trial and error, the builders implemented a system of four permanent mooring cables attached to the base of the mast. The system was specially designed to support the high winds of New York City, allowing the dirigibles to dock securely, much like a boat would do to a pier or dock.

Another obstacle builders of the Empire State Building faced was the operating mechanism that was necessary for the fore and aft moorings to secure the ships. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it is stated that the builders had to design a special system consisting of two 600-pound hawsers that were placed through a series of pulleys and guided to the anchor sockets below the mast. Created with the help of Lockheed Aircraft, this system caused the mast to bend ever so slightly as the airship maneuvered it into the proper docking location.
