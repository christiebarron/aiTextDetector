The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a profound effect on the cyclist in the story. The story is set on a quiet gravel road in the countryside, with the cyclist riding on an old bike. The setting of the countryside gives the cyclist peace and tranquility as the road is so isolated and only the sounds of nature can be heard. This creates an atmosphere of relaxation, allowing the cyclist to focus on the task at hand.

At the same time, the road is described as “rugged” and there are “hills and bumps” present. This provides a certain degree of difficulty for the cyclist, as the gravel road is challenging to manoeuvre and being an old bike, the cyclist must use her strength and skill to maintain her balance. This adds an element of difficulty to her journey and ensures that she can test and strengthen her cycling abilities.

The presence of nature, the calm atmosphere, and the challenging road conditions all work to create an environment in which the cyclist can build her skills in a safe and stimulating environment. The cyclist is able to focus on the road and hone her skills, while being surrounded by a peaceful atmosphere and the beauty of nature
