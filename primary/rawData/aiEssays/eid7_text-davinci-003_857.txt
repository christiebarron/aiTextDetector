I remember a time when I had to be particularly patient. I had a big exam coming up, and I had just hours to study. All of my friends were outside playing and having fun. It was really hard to focus and ignore the temptation of joining them.

But I kept telling myself that I really wanted to do well on this particular test and it was better if I stayed inside and studied. So, despite all the temptations and peer pressure, I remained patient. I redoubled my efforts and put the extra time into studying.

In the end, it was worth it; I aced the exam and was very proud of myself for having been so patient. It's incredible how much stronger will power and determination can be when you remain patient and remind yourself what you are working for.
