I recently had a difficult doctor’s appointment where I was expecting to receive a lot of news about a chronic health condition. I was feeling apprehensive about the appointment beforehand, but I also wanted to remain positive.

When I got to the doctor’s office, there was a long wait before I could be seen. I could feel my anxiety rising, but I kept my patience. I took some deep breaths, reminded myself why I was there and focused on slowly letting the stress go.

Once I was in the examination room with my doctor, we went through a series of tests and discussed my health concerns. I could tell that my doctor had a lot of information to share, and I knew I had to be patient and give her the time she needed to explain everything. 

We discussed possible treatments and she answered all of my questions in detail. Even though I was anxious to get all the information, I vowed to stay open-minded and not rush the appointment.

Throughout the entire appointment, I stayed patient. I took my time to process what I was being told, asked more questions when needed, and ultimately I left with a better understanding of my condition. My patience eventually paid off and I felt grateful that I was able to get the answers and help that I needed.
