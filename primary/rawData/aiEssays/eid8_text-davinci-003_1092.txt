I was out on a first date with a guy I had met online and we were at a local cafe, getting to know one another. Everything was going great and we had been chatting and laughing for hours. Finally, towards the end of the night, I started telling a story that I had heard recently. I waved my hands around in the air as I exaggerated some of the details and before I knew it, my date was laughing uncontrollably! His laughter was so contagious that soon I was laughing just as hard. We both laughed until tears were streaming down our faces, making the moment itself all the more special. Even though the story wasn't all that funny, the fact that we could laugh together, with the same intensity, felt like a victory for us both, and it's been one of the fondest memories from our relationship.
