The dream of mooring dirigibles at the Empire State Building seemed within grasp in the 1920s and 1930s as society turned its attention to the sky. While aircraft and other flying machines had taken off as the world’s latest craze, the hope of mooring large airships like Graf Zeppelin above the skyscraper was something many had their eyes set on. However, for all the excitement and newness of air transport, the Empire State Building also posed numerous obstacles as engineers attempted to turn this dream into reality.

First and foremost was the lack of an anchor to moor the ships. Without a reliable way of fastening the large, bulky frame of a zeppelin to the building, any mooring was impossible. This was further complicated by the difficulty of constructing the required anchors on the building’s exterior—since the Empire State Building was already in use, such a task would have been both expensive and time-consuming.

The second challenge that builders of the Empire State Building faced when accommodating dirigibles was designing a mast that could support the weight of the airships. Considering the Empire State Building was not built for the purpose of mooring ships, the structural strength of the building was not enough to support a large, expensive zeppelin. This meant that a new mast had to be designed and implemented that could handle the strain of continuous ship docking.

Even once the mooring problems were solved, there were other practical issues that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. For one, the air around the building was dangerously unstable, making
