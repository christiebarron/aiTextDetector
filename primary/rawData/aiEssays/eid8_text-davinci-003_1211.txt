I had been dating my partner for several weeks and we had been getting along great. We had done all the traditional date activities- dinner, movies, walks in the park- and were getting to know each other well. 

It wasn't until one day, while just hanging out together, that I realized something special had developed between us. We were talking about something the other had said, and I found myself smiling uncontrollably. Suddenly, we both burst out laughing and I knew this must be love.

The laughter that day was like nothing else I had ever experienced before. It seemed to wash over us and continue for ages. We laughed until our sides hurt and tears were streaming from our eyes. We had bonded in a way that can only be described as magical.

At that moment, I knew this was something extraordinary. We connected on a level beyond initial conversations and movie dates. Our laughter was a way for us to communicate and to appreciate each other for exactly who we were. 

Now, no matter what the topic of conversation or situation is, if one of us starts laughing, itâ€™s quickly contagious. Laughter is something that connects us and brings us even closer together. In each other we have found our soul mate, and we celebrate that connection every day.
