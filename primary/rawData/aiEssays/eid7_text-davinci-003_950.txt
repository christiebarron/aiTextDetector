I was running late for an appointment and I was usually very prompt. On my way out the door I realized I had forgotten my wallet and keys, so I had to go back to get them. After retrieving them, I got in my car and began to drive, but every red light felt like an eternity. I was getting increasingly frustrated, but I knew that overreacting wouldn't do me any good. So, I simply took a deep breath, reminded myself to remain patient and calmly waited for each red light to turn green.

I eventually made it to my appointment and apologized to the person I was meeting. They were understanding and accepted my apology, but I was still embarrassed by my tardiness. I thanked them for their patience and promised to work on being more punctual in the future. I left feeling thankful that I was able to practice patience during that situation.
