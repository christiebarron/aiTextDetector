The Empire State Building was an incredible feat of engineering and ambition. The iconic structure featured in countless films and postcards served as a beacon of modernity and progress. From the opening of the 102-story building in 1931, a notable feature that made it stand out was its “mooring mast”, an articulated steel arm atop the structure that enabled dirigibles to dock.

The idea to install a mooring mast on the Empire State Building came directly from the mouth of William Lamb, the building's architect. To make his vision a reality, Lamb enlisted the help of designer Karl Ruckdeschel and specialist Carl Eckmair. Together, the three men faced several issues and overcome many obstacles to make the mooring mast a reality. 

One of the biggest hurdles to enabling the docking of dirigibles involved the Fire Department, which had to approve the installation of a steel mast that could potentially obstruct firefighters from performing rescue operations. The team was able to gain the fire chief's approval by demonstrating how the mast could be retracted when necessary and by including a special fire escape ladder on the mast itself. This compromise enabled the mooring mast to stay in place during emergencies.

The team also had to consider technical issues, such as the force of gusts of wind on the helicopter and cable that would tether the airship. To account for this, they opted for thicker steel cables, as well as a sturdy swivel that could move freely with the wind. Additionally, there was the worry of the docked dirigible breaking free and damaging the building, so the team
