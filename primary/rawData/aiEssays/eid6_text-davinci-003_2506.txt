The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City was a remarkable feat of engineering and soon became a major icon of the New York skyline. By 1931, the building was the worldâ€™s tallest structure, ready to be seen from the skies by a new invention, the dirigible. Dirigibles, also known as airships, were the first form of aviation technology to be able to carry a large number of passengers and cargo to and from the building. However, in order for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, various obstacles had to be overcome.

The first obstacle was the fact that the building was not initially designed to accommodate landing from these types of aircrafts. Before any type of dirigible docking could happen, two large steel mooring masts were required to be constructed. These mooring masts had to be able to support the immense weight of the massive airships, as many of them weighed close to 50 tons. Additionally, each of the mooring masts also had to be tall enough to reach the altitudes used by airships when docking. These mooring masts had to bring their own special set of problems. 

The mooring masts had to be securely bolted to the roof of the building and made to survive the high winds that surrounded the building while also being tall enough to let the dirigibles descend safely. This was an even more difficult task when you consider that the higher the mooring mast, the more powerful the gusts of winds became. This meant a delicate balance of making them tall enough but also strong
