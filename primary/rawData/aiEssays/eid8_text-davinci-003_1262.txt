I remember the first time I met my best friend. We were both starting a new job in the same office and while the rest of our new colleagues were sitting around intimidated and intimidated, I could tell that she was different.

She had a huge smile on her face and when our eyes met across the room, we both started to giggle. We had no idea why we were laughing - but before we knew it, we had both erupted in fits of laughter. Everyone around us stopped and stared at us, both of us now red-faced and struggling to catch our breath. We had no idea what we found so funny, it quite honestly didn't matter.

From then on, we knew we had a special bond. All of our conversations were full of laughter and joy, we somehow managed to make each other giggle even when life was tough. We even created our own secret language full of puns and jokes, so we could make each other laugh no matter the situation.

Even now, years later, laughter is still at the center of our friendship. Whenever we spend time together, there is hardly a moment that goes by without at least a few seconds of shared laughter. It's a powerful emotion, and I'm blessed to be able to share it with her.
