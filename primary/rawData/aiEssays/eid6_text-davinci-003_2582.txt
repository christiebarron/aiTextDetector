The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the biggest challenges was the location of the structure in the crowded city of New York. The skyscraper was designed and situated in such a way that a mooring mast would need to be attached to the building’s upper floors. This meant that the top of the structure would need to be raised higher than the surrounding buildings to accommodate a mooring mast, making the dock visible from the street below. It also meant that the Empire State Building would have to be structurally reinforced to carry the additional weight of a dirigible.

In addition, the builders of the Empire State Building had to take into consideration the air flow of the city when designing the mooring mast. This would require a large metal mast to extend some 200 feet into the air, and the surrounding buildings would have to be factored into the design. The mast would need to be powerful enough to withstand the wind pressure of the city, while also providing a stable mooring point weight of up to two million pounds. 

The other major obstacle was finding a feasible way to anchor the mooring mast to the Empire State Building. The designers had to come up with a way to attach the mast to the building safely and securely, while taking into consideration the aerodynamics of the mast as it remained in place. The designers had to take into account the size and wind resistance of the mast, as well as the building’s own structure, when designing the system of attachment. 

Finally, the builders would
