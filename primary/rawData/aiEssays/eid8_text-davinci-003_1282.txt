I was visiting my best friend, Katie, for the weekend. We had planned a few activities, including a day at the farmer's market. After a morning filled with lively conversations, delicious snacks, and interesting finds, we decided it was time for lunch. On our way to the food truck, we stumbled upon a man juggling bright yellow oranges. We both started laughing and simultaneously said, "Wow, what a colorful talent!" 

As soon as the man turned around to answer, we recognized him as the old neighbor who used to live across the street from Katie. We ran up to him and hugged him, laughing from the joy of running into an old friend in such an unexpected place. He proceeded to juggle for us for the next few minutes and we all were doubled over in laughter when he managed to juggle five oranges at once.

We stayed with him for a while and caught up on old times. We talked about old memories, how his juggling business was doing and his new life since moving to the country. We left that encounter with a renewed feeling of connection and with our faces still smiling from the laughter that had brought us together.
