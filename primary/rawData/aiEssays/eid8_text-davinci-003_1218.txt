I was visiting my uncle in another town and my cousin, his son, had come down to meet me. We were catching up over lunch and chatting about life, laughing over our memories and recounting funny stories. As he talked, I couldn’t help but notice how much he had grown up since I had seen him last. He was now an adult, but he still had that same mischievous twinkle in his eye.

Suddenly, my uncle chirped in, “I know what will make this lunch even more fun; a dare for you two! Let’s see who can dance a jig in the restaurant!”

My cousin and I looked at each other with a tinge of surprise and amusement. We had known my uncle to be funny and a bit of a prankster, but this was an unexpected challenge.

We glanced at our surroundings. It seemed like a risky proposition considering there were a few people around! But the laughter was contagious and we decided to give it a go. We both got up and had a little jig in the middle of the restaurant.

The stunned expressions of others around us quickly give way to fits of laughter and applause. We had just given them the most unexpected and entertaining show of the day! Everyone was laughing and in that moment, even the strangers in the restaurant felt like family. I couldn’t help but think of how laughter can truly be the shortest distance between two people.
