However, it is important to realize that censorship does not necessarily involve censorship of materials. On the contrary, censorship in libraries is about compromisingâ€“it is about providing materials that are appropriate for everyone, regardless of their personal beliefs.

Censorship in libraries is about choosing which materials are available to patrons and setting limits based on what is generally acceptable. Libraries should provide an environment that is safe for everyone, and this means making sure that potentially offensive materials are not readily available. 

That does not mean removing all materials that could be deemed offensive, however. Choosing which materials stay and which go should be done on a case-by-case basis. Libraries should use their discretion to decide what materials are appropriate and acceptable in their environment. 

Censorship can be essential to maintaining order and respect in a public library as it is done only after careful consideration. It should be the last resort, not the first solution when dealing with inappropriate materials.

Allowing access to materials that challenge popular beliefs can be essential to ensuring a well-rounded view of the world. Keeping potentially offensive materials on the shelves can be a way of promoting a vibrant, open dialogue.

It is important to remember that censorship in libraries should not be taken as an absolute. Libraries should be open to reasonable debate and censorship should only be used when absolutely necessary. With thoughtfulness,
