I had been friends with Robert for over a decade, and although we rarely saw each other in person, our conversations could always make us laugh.

One day, I decided to surprise him by visiting him, and as soon as he saw me, he erupted in laughter. I had the most ridiculous facial expression on my face – a look of sheer shock and amusement, that had his entire face and body shaking with laughter. 

He couldn't contain himself. I started to laugh too and soon we were both in tears, struggling to catch our breaths between fits of laughter. 

It felt absolutely amazing. As I wiped away my tears of happiness, I thanked him for always being my source of joy, even after all these years. We just smiled and laughed, knowing that our friendship meant too much to us. 

We would talk and laugh like this many times thereafter, and it’s a memory that I’ll always cherish.
