I was on a first date with this girl I had recently met. We were in a restaurant and the conversation was a bit awkward. I was racking my brain trying to think of something to talk about that would make us both laugh. Suddenly, an idea came to me and I said, "Let's play a game. I'll say something funny and you repeat it with a silly accent".

Luckily, she was game and we started going back and forth, each saying increasingly absurd sentences with a different accent each time. We were laughing so hard that people around us started looking and smiling.

The evening flew by, and before I knew it, the date was over. We hugged goodbye and I felt grateful that laughter had eased the awkwardness between us. Now whenever we get together, we always begin with a game of "silly accents", reliving the laughter and joy of our first date.
