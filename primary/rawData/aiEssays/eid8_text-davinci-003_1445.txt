It was a Saturday night and my friends and I decided to go out to have a good time. We went to our favorite small bar and claimed a large booth in the corner. We each ordered our beverages and began talking when suddenly my friend Tessa started cracking up. "What's so funny?" I asked.

She tried to pull herself together and said, "Oh, nothing, I just remembered a funny story. I was out at the store earlier today and there was this old lady in front of me at the checkout counter. She had a cart filled with items that were obviously for a party. When the cashier asked if she wanted paper or plastic, the old lady was so confused she just stared at her for a few seconds and said in a very confused voice, 'Party?'"

We all started laughing and then the rest of the night was filled with laughter. Whether we were telling funny stories or simply laughing about some crazy dance move we had seen, we all felt truly connected in that moment. It is amazing how laughter can bond people so quickly and effectively. Laughter had created a strong bond amongst us in just one night and I will never forget that.
