Dear Editor, 

I am writing to discuss the effects computers have on people today. With the rise in technology, it's no surprise that computers play a huge role in our lives. 

On one hand, computers provide numerous benefits. Whether it be running a business, teaching, or staying connected to friends and family - computers are essential to help people stay efficient, organized and connected. 

On the other hand, computers can be destructive. Although they make some tasks easier, they can cause people to become lazy. People need to unplug or they can become overwhelmed with the digital noise, leading to burnout and mental exhaustion. Computers also create a sense of isolation, as people can rely heavily on them for communication to the point where all other forms of personal interaction are neglected. 

Therefore, I argue that it is essential for people to find a balance between using computers and taking a break from them. We should use computers only for necessary tasks and limit the amount of time we spend on them. Going outside, spending time with friends, taking part in physical activities, and getting a proper amount of sleep are essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

It's important for people to recognize the power of computers, but it's even more important for people to prioritize their wellbeing and not be consumed too heavily in digital lives. 

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
