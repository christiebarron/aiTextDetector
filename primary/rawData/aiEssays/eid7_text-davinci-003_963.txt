When I was a young child, I often had difficulty falling asleep at night. My parents were very patient, never scolding or punishing me; instead they were understanding and let me find my own way to a peaceful sleep. Every night they'd wait with me until I finally drifted off, and if I happened to wake up in the middle of the night, they were always there to help and guide me back to sleep. I felt safe and secure knowing that my parents had an infinite amount of patience towards me.
