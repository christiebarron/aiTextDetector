Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. I believe that computers have had an unequivocally positive influence on modern life.

First, computers have made everyday tasks considerably easier and more efficient. As an example, it would take roughly two full days for an accountant to manually compile financial records for the average business. The same job can be done on a computer in a matter of hours. This improved efficiency has allowed businesses to grow and expand, allowing us to access new products and services which would have been impossible otherwise.

Second, computers have also improved our ability to access and share information. Instead of spending hours in a library searching for the necessary information, one can search the internet and find what they are looking for in a fraction of the time. In addition, computers have added a new layer of communication in the form of the internet. Social media has allowed us to stay in touch with friends and family, regardless of geographical location.

Finally, computers have brought some amazing new entertainment experiences. Video games have become incredibly life-like and immersive, with developers harnessing the power of computers to make games more vivid and realistic than ever.

In my view, computers have been an incredible technology that has changed our lives for the better, and I am sure that readers of this paper would agree.

Yours sincerely,
