When the Empire State Building was being constructed in the early 1930s, the architects considered incorporating a floating mooring mast for dirigibles, paving the way for one of the era’s most ambitious achievements. For engineer J.L. Wiley, the task of designing this mooring mast came with a host of problems and obstacles he needed to overcome.

At 200 feet in the air, the mooring mast posed significant issues of stability and movement. In order for the mast to support the necessary load, it had to be constructed with the proper materials, including steel and concrete, and it had to be built to withstand powerful winds. Complementing the structural engineering of the mast, Wiley also needed to devise a system of pulleys and anchor cables to ensure the safety and security of the docking vessels.

The operation of Wiley’s mooring mast system was also fraught with challenges. To begin with, the mast had to be designed to move in multiple directions, as dirigibles were typically maneuvered around the mast by their pilots. Furthermore, the mooring mast needed to accommodate the use of an elevator, allowing loaders to move materials and passengers between the dirigible and the Empire State Building.

In addition, Wiley and his team chose to innovate the mooring mast with an automated system that could easily be operated and adjusted by a single person. This was intended to reduce any risks associated with manually managing the mast’s functions and to minimize the risk of accidents or delays. In the end, the mooring mast was widely considered a success- the
