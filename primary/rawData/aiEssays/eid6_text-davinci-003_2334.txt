The ambitious endeavor of incorporating dirigible dockings into the Empire State Building was a feat that the builders of the structure faced a number of obstacles. When a plan to capture publicity and give people from the US and different countries the sense that this building was truly remarkable—this grand opportunity certainly had its challenges. 

The foremost obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the geometric layout of the building itself. The 80th floor of the Empire State building was an uppermost mooring mast that extended off the top of the building. The mooring mast was specially designed to be the point of access for dirigibles. The mooring mast was setup in a triangular shape which created a number of issues with the size and shape of the building. There were structural concerns that the triangular shape of the mooring mast would cause instability due to the wind and the inability to be integrated properly with the floors and walls of the tower.

Another concern was the issue of weight capacity. The construction of the mooring mast weighed a great deal and it was unclear as to whether the Empire State Building would be able to handle the additional weight of a full-size dirigible. This was especially true given the severe winds of the area, which further decreased the structural integrity of the mooring mast. 

Once the necessary details had been refined, the builders of the mooring mast had to secure the support of the public. This could have been an issue since the modern citizen of the 1920s didn’t quite grasp the concept of dirigibles. Moreover, they came with
