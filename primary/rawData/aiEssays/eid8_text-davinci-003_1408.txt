 

My sister and I often had good-natured rivalry growing up. We perhaps argued more than we should have, but it was our way of showing how much we loved and cared for each other.

One Saturday evening when we were both home, I decided to tease my sister about something insignificant. We were both laughing, and it felt really good. But in a matter of moments, what started as a joke stopped making sense and none of us could make out what we were saying. 

It was then that the both of us just started to laugh uncontrollably. The room filled with our laughing and it felt like it went on for hours. It felt like joy and love were radiating from us and connecting us in a deeper way than ever before.

During all this, my parents witnessed the entire thing, and even they couldn't help but laugh. It felt as if we had all connected in that moment, and it's still something I remember whenever I feel lonely or disconnected. 

That's what laughter can do - connect two people in the shortest distance possible.
