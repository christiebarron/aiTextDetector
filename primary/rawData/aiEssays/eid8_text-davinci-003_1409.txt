I remember the first time I met my future wife. It was at a church picnic. We ended up talking for almost the whole event. She had a great sense of humor and I felt really comfortable around her.

At one point in our conversation, we started talking about her siblings. She told me a funny story about one of her brothers that made me laugh so hard it actually made my sides hurt. She laughed too, and the look of joy on her face was unmistakable.

It was right then that I knew I had met the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. We have been together now for over twenty-five years and, to this day, when we share a laugh together it's like nothing has changed since that first picnic. Laughter really is the best way to bring two people closer, and I am so glad that I got to laugh with my future wife that day.
