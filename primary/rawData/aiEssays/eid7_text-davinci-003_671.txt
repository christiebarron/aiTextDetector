I remember the time I had to wait in line for over an hour while trying to buy a new phone. Everyone seemed to be having technical difficulties and the process seemed to be taking forever. I could feel my patience wearing thin, but I decided to stay positive and remain patient. When it was finally my turn I remained calm and polite, even though the process seemed to be stalling again. The salesperson apologized for the wait and offered me a coupon to make up for it. I graciously accepted and thanked them for their patience. In the end, I was able to get my new phone and I was grateful for the salesperson's kindness.
