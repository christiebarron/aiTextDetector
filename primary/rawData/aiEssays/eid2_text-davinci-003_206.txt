Censorship in libraries is an increasingly controversial issue. Many believe that materials that are found offensive should be removed from the shelves, while others argue that such actions would be a form of government censorship. 

Proponents of removing certain materials from libraries contend that it is in the best interest of the public, who use the libraries regularly. They argue that these materials are offensive and inappropriate, and their availability gives the impressions of endorsement or acceptance of these materials by libraries. Therefore, these materials should be removed in order to uphold the values of the library and those of the patrons who frequent it. 

Opponents of censorship believe that removing these materials directly impedes on our fundamental freedom of speech. They assert that library materials should reflect diverse opinions and beliefs, and should make all materials available to the public, save for those that are illegally obscene. 

Moreover, opponents point out that censorship can set a dangerous precedent of control over what ideas are acceptable and which are not. Censorship would also place libraries in a position to determine which materials can and cannot be offered, leading to charges of subjectivity or bias. 

Ultimately, it is up to libraries to decide what their policies are on certain material. However, before deciding, important factors should be taken into consideration which balance public interest and freedom of speech. Libraries should be an outlet for intellectual growth, and therefore provide patrons with both a wide range of material, and the freedom to make their own decisions about what to read, watch or listen to.
