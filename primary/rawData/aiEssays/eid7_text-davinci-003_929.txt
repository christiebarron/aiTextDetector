I recently had a long day at work and was very tired when I got home. My daughter was having difficulty with her calculus homework, so she asked me to help her. I understand math can be challenging and I wanted to help her, but I really did not have the energy or patience to explain the math to her. Despite this, I took a deep breath and reminded myself to stay patient. 

I ended up taking a few minutes to sit down and explain the problems to my daughter. I was doing my best to be clear and concise, and though it was a struggle, I kept trying not to show my frustration. My daughter eventually understood the problems and was able to finish her homework. I was proud of her for sticking with it, and of myself for staying patient.
