I recently found myself in a difficult situation in which a friend of mine was being extremely difficult to deal with and was relentlessly venting her frustrations on me. I did my best to keep my composure, but it was very hard. My friend kept making offhand comments and sarcastically rolling her eyes at me, which really hurt my feelings. The situation was really frustrating, and it felt like it was taking forever to get through.

However, I realized that getting angry wouldn't help the situation and I just needed to be patient and be understanding of her feelings. I didn't need to retaliate and make the situation worse. I took a deep breath, put a smile on my face and just let her get it all out. Once she had calmed down, she was actually thankful for me being patient and understanding of her feelings. Most importantly, it allowed us to repair our friendship.
