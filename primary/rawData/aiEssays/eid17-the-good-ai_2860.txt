Effect of Exercise on the Rate of Respiration and the Heart Rate
Introduction
Exercise is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. It helps maintain physical fitness, improves cardiovascular health, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. The effect of exercise on the rate of respiration and heart rate has been studied extensively over the years. This essay will explore the relationship between exercise and these two physiological processes.
Effect of Exercise on Respiration Rate
Respiration is the process by which oxygen is taken in by the body and carbon dioxide is expelled. During exercise, respiration rate increases to meet the increased demand for oxygen by working muscles. This increase in respiration rate is due to several factors.
Firstly, during exercise, muscle cells require more energy than at rest. To produce this energy, they need more oxygen than usual. The increased demand for oxygen leads to an increase in breathing rate to supply more oxygen to working muscles.
Secondly, during exercise, blood flow increases to working muscles. This increased blood flow carries more oxygen from the lungs to working muscles and removes carbon dioxide produced by them. The removal of carbon dioxide from working muscles also contributes to an increase in respiration rate.
Thirdly, during exercise, body temperature increases due to metabolic activity in muscle cells. An increase in body temperature leads to an increase in respiration rate as it helps dissipate heat from the body.
The effect of exercise on respiration rate can be measured using various methods such as spirometry or pulse oximetry. Spirometry measures lung function by measuring how much air a person can inhale and exhale while pulse oximetry measures blood oxygen levels using a non-invasive device placed on a person's finger.
Studies have shown that regular aerobic exercise training can improve lung function and reduce respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath (Puhan et al., 2011). Regular physical activity also reduces the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory diseases (Garcia-Aymerich et al., 2015).
Effect of Exercise on Heart Rate
The heart is a muscle that pumps blood throughout the body. During exercise, the heart rate increases to meet the increased demand for oxygen by working muscles. The increase in heart rate is due to several factors.
Firstly, during exercise, muscle cells require more oxygen than at rest. To supply this oxygen, the heart needs to pump more blood to working muscles. The increased demand for blood flow leads to an increase in heart rate.
Secondly, during exercise, sympathetic nervous system activity increases. This leads to an increase in heart rate as it stimulates the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline which increase cardiac output.
Thirdly, during exercise, body temperature increases due to metabolic activity in muscle cells. An increase in body temperature leads to an increase in heart rate as it helps dissipate heat from the body.
The effect of exercise on heart rate can be measured using various methods such as electrocardiography (ECG) or pulse oximetry. ECG measures electrical activity in the heart while pulse oximetry measures blood oxygen levels using a non-invasive device placed on a person's finger.
Studies have shown that regular aerobic exercise training can improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and coronary artery disease (Cornelissen & Fagard, 2017). Regular physical activity also improves cardiac function and reduces resting heart rate (Kokkinos et al., 2019).
Conclusion
In conclusion, exercise has a significant effect on respiration rate and heart rate. During exercise, respiration rate increases due to increased demand for oxygen by working muscles, increased blood flow to working muscles and an increase in body temperature due to metabolic activity. Similarly, during exercise, heart rate increases due to increased demand for oxygen by working muscles, increased sympathetic nervous system activity and an increase in body temperature due to metabolic activity. Regular physical activity has been shown to improve lung function, reduce respiratory symptoms, improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases such as hypertension and coronary artery disease.
