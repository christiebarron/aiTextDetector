The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski has a huge effect on the cyclist. Initially, the reader is thrown into the foreboding landscape of a gravel road winding its way through the countryside. This discovery of the road’s rugged terrain is compounded by a layer of mud and water that further emphasizes the difficulty the cyclist will face on their journey. In addition to the tumultuous weather, the fact that the area is devoid of houses or other signs of civilization suggests to the cyclist a lonely and seemingly empty world ahead of them. 

The cyclist soon discovers a sign which reads “Warning: Rough Road Ahead” – a warning which serves as both a warning and a challenge.

This knowledge will cause them to draw upon all their skill and strength in order to make it to the end. The cyclist also is confronted with the fear that they may be in over their heads, as they have little to no knowledge of what lies beyond the sign.
