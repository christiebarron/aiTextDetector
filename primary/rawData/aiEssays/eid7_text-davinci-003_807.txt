I recently had a job interviewing for a position that I really wanted and felt confident about. During the interview, however, I started to feel frustrated when I felt like the interviewer wasn't hearing my answers to her questions. I could feel my frustration boiling underneath and was about to give up and leave, but then I reminded myself to stay patient. 

So, I took a few deep breaths and remained calm. I reminded myself that I was already in the interview, and all I had to do was finish it in a respectful way. Instead of getting angry, I chose to stay composed and kept answering the interviewer's questions to the best of my abilities. I knew that no matter the outcome, it was important to remain respectful and patient throughout the experience.

At the end of the interview, the interviewer thanked me for being so patient and understanding. I was delighted to know that my patience paid off, and that the interviewer noticed and appreciated it. Even though I didn't get the job, I'm grateful for having had the opportunity to exercise my patience and stay level-headed throughout the process.
