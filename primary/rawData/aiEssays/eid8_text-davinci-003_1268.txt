I remember growing up with my best friend, Alex. We were practically inseparable, and had been since we met in first grade. One thing that we would always do was laugh together. We would tell long, outrageous stories, uncaring of whether they made sense or not, as long as it made the other person laugh. 

One particular night a few days before school was scheduled to start up, we stayed up late. We were playing a game of truth or dare, when Alex picked truth. His question was “what’s the most embarrassing thing that’s ever happened to you?” Without hesitation, I launched into a story about when I ran into the basketball hoop in front of the entire school during recess. Not only did I have zero coordination, but I had also tripped in front of everyone! 

The details got more and more outrageous as I went on, and before I knew it, Alex was laughing so hard that he almost fell off the couch. Tears of laughter were streaming down his face as he begged me to stop. For the entire night, I continued to regale him with my mishaps and embarrassing moments, and we couldn’t stop laughing.

The laughter wasn’t just the start of the night, though; it was the foundation of our friendship. That night, I realized that no matter what happened, our bond was built on laughter and memories (even embarrassing ones). 

Laughter keeps us close, reminding us that there is nothing that can tear us apart.
