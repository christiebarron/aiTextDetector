I was walking through the park, enjoying the sunshine, when I noticed a couple ahead of me. They weren't doing, or even saying, anything special. But every now and then, they both erupted in gales of laughter that made me smile, too. 

I couldn't help but envy the natural ease and openness they had with each other. It was obvious by the way they laughed that there was a deep friendship and understanding between the two. 

As I got closer to them, I started to hear what they were talking about. It seemed like something small had set off their initial burst of laughter: a spilled drink, an old memory, a silly joke. But before I knew it, whatever had caused that initial spark had already passed and morphed into something else that made them chuckle even harder. 

I watched them as they walked, chatting and joking as if nothing else in the world mattered. After a few minutes, I felt myself smiling for reasons I didn't quite understand. 

I realized then that laughter really was the shortest distance between two people. It was something intimate, something that brought closeness and connection without the need for words. The sound of those two people laughing together had carried to me and made me feel a part of it. 

In that moment, I understood why laughter is so integral to building relationships, and was grateful for the reminder.
