Dear Editor,

In recent years, our society has experienced an exponential growth in the use of computers and other electronic devices. With such an influx of technology, it has become increasingly important to consider the effects it has on us as people.

As consumers of technology, it is easy to become reliant on the ease and convenience that computers bring us. Unfortunately, too much reliance can lead to a lack of motivation and problem-solving skills. We may find ourselves search for answers rather than engaging in critical thought and innovation.

That said, the use of computers should not be discouraged but embraced in a way that reinforces healthy habits. We need to be thoughtful in our use and make sure our time is spent developing other skills, such as reading and writing, to prevent our dependence on computers.

By using computers, the workplace becomes more efficient and personal productivity can increase. This can ultimately lead to an increase in overall output and development. On the flip side, computers have also been known to decrease our desire to collaborate and work with others, instead leading us to believe that we can achieve goals and solve problems on our own.

The effects of computers and electronic devices on people should not be perceived as detrimental. Rather, technology should be utilized in ways that help us stay creatively active and connected with others, while promoting innovation and progress.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
