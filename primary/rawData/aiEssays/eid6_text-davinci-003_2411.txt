The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a novel and ambitious concept when first proposed. Unfortunately, the idea encountered a variety of obstacles. From the features of the building itself, to the practicalities of air travel, to the cityscape of New York City, the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building presented a major challenge.

The building itself posed a major obstacle. When building the Empire State Building, the architects had not intended for dirigibles to use it as a docking site. The building was simply not designed to accommodate the amount of air traffic and the air space for docking large airships. Because the building was already completed, builders would need to make significant modifications to the structure in order to make it suitable for airship travel. These modifications included the addition of a mooring mast, a high cable-trestle to which dirigibles could attach upon docking.

In addition, the practicalities of air travel posed their own unique set of obstacles. Airships of the time period were slow and had limited cargo space, meaning that docking at the Empire State Building would be difficult to achieve in an efficient manner. Furthermore, the altitude and incline of the mast were two areas that were difficult to accurately calculate, as the wind speed and air pressure could lead to unpredictable air currents in the region.

Finally, the cityscape of New York City posed its own set of challenges, as the skyline had grown significantly since the construction of the Empire State Building, leading to issues of air traffic control and the potential for air traffic congestion. In addition
