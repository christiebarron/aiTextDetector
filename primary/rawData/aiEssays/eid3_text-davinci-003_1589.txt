In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” the setting plays a major role in the cyclist's journey. The cyclist is embedded in a rural landscape filled with hills, mountains, and trails that provide various levels of difficulty as they cycle. This creates a challenge for the cyclist, as they need to push themselves to the limit in order to make it through the rough terrain.

The hills and mountains also add to the intensity of the experience. Not only does it make it more difficult for the cyclist to make it up the incline, but also the altitude can make it hard to breathe as well. The cyclist must learn to recognize their limits and push past it if they are to conquer the road ahead. Additionally, the winding paths add to the difficulty of the route and test the cyclist's endurance.

Lastly, the trails the cyclist is riding on brings its own set of difficulties. Not only is the cyclist challenged by the terrain, with changes in temperature and tight turns, but they also have to be on the lookout for any dangers that might lurk in the brush alongside them. Having to be alert and on guard at all times adds to the difficulty of the journey.
