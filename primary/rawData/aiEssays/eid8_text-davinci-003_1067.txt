I was visiting my grandparents for the summer one year and I always looked forward to our weekly trip out for ice cream. One Friday night, we all piled in the car looking forward to the special treat. When my grandpa started the car though, he backed into a parked car behind us. His joke was that it was the fastest way to get out of the parking lot! We all immediately started laughing, even though we all knew he hadn't meant it. 

The owner of the parked car came running out and he was not happy. After some negotiations between him and my grandpa, we all climbed back in the car and just before the man turned to go we all started laughing again. The man looked back at us and started shaking his head. He couldn't help but crack a smile and when he did, we all shared a good chuckle and headed off to enjoy some ice cream. 

To this day, every time we talk about that night, we all laugh and remember how a silly moment of embarrassment brought us all together. Laughter can bridge any gap between people and I'll never forget it.
