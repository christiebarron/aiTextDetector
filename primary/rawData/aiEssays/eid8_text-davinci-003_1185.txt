I'd just returned home after a rough day of work and was feeling exhausted. My husband offered to order pizza for dinner, and I welcomed the chance to relax. We were settling in on the couch when he made a silly joke. We both started to laugh. We laughed so hard that tears ran down my face.

I'd almost forgotten how good it felt to laugh together. Before we knew it, we were lost in a fit of laughter. We laughed about memories of our past, about silly jokes we'd shared and about future plans. I felt our relationship growing stronger with each shared laugh. 

When the pizza came, our laughter only intensified. We created jokes around the toppings, recounted old chicken dance competitions, and remembered the day we'd met. It felt like a special long-distance hug. 

The night eventually had to end, but our laughter lingered long after. I realized in that moment how powerful laughter can be, and how integral it is to the health of a relationship. We shared a lightness and joy together that I'll never forget.
