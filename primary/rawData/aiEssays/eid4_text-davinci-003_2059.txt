The symbolic power of the Winter Hibiscus in Minfong Ho's poem is to illustrate a cycle of life. Throughout the poem, she emphasizes how the hibiscus survives through the miserably cold winter season, so much so that the speaker interprets it as a sign of resilience and strength. In the final stanza, she uses the metaphor to explain how the speaker personally adapts to life's challenges - the cold winter months being used as a metaphor for difficult times and a reminder that the speaker must continue to fight and carry on, despite her current predicament. 

The speaker hints at a time of personal suffering and a test that she has yet to pass. The harsh winter months provide a chance for the speaker to reflect on her situation and remind her of her capabilities. Unlike the hibiscus in winter, she does not have the ability flower in the winter yet, but she does have the resilience to survive the cold. She chooses to use the metaphor of the winter hibiscus to explain her emotions, feeling of failure and her will to survive and eventually triumph in the end. 

The speaker is mindful of the natural cycle of the hibiscus, which blooms and dies before being reborn in the next year. With this metaphor, she implies that she draws her strength not only from her current environment but also how she can eventually succeed following a difficult period of pain. Ultimately, Ho uses the metaphor of the winter hibiscus to remind the speaker that nothing is truly permanent so she must continue to fight and persevere during her difficult times and when she has the opportunity
