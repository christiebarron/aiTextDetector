The Empire State Building was a technological marvel when it rose to completion in 1931 and remained the tallest building in the world for the next 40 years. One of the most iconic features of the building was the plan to incorporate a mooring mast, which would be used to dock dirigibles to the building. Despite efforts to make the mooring mast a reality, there were many obstacles to overcome before this could be achieved.

The first obstacle was the strength of the wind. The mooring mast had to be able to support the weight of the dirigibles, which were then the largest airships being used. As the winds around the Empire State Building could be particularly strong, the mooring mast had to be designed to weather such turbulence without buckling or cracking. As such, the steel mast had to be made stronger and thicker than any other mast in existence at the time. After much experimentation, the design was complete and the mast was deemed ready for use.

The second obstacle was the actual approach and docking of the dirigibles. The Empire State Building was not only tall, but its distance from the surface of Manhattanâ€™s Central Park made it a difficult target for the dirigibles to hit. As such, a system of windsocks was installed around the building to guide the dirigibles in. These would indicate the air current patterns and wind direction so the pilots would be able to adjust their course accordingly. These windsocks would also serve as objects for the dirigible to catch onto for the actual docking process. In addition, the design of the mooring mast had to
