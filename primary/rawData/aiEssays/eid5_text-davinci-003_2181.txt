Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, meditates on the blueprint of lives that are often unseen. Rodriguez utilizes his storytelling and lyrical prose to create a mood of nostalgia and sentimentality. His powerful words force the reader to gain insight and perspective on their own lives.

From the outset, Rodriguez conveys a wistful and reflective mood. He captures the essence of memories that fade but do not disappear, "The memories live within us, carry us home no matter where we go." The memoir speaks to home, or the place, that lives within each of us. In true memoir fashion, Rodriguez introduces his core, his quest, and his themes all in a few words. As the memoir progresses, the nostalgia and longing of home intensifies with the description of Rodriguez's childhood home and how the walls, smells, and sounds of home never really leave us. With an intimate cadence, Rodriguez carefully encapsulates the idea of home and how identities and cultures form us, but we also return home in order to be active participants and stewards of our identities.

The tone then shifts to a mood of tenderness and solace, as Rodriguez's memoir mirrors the sentiments of so many immigrants, "the feeling of longing is as vast as the ocean, of homes that we sometimes find and sometimes build, split between moments filled with sorrow and joy, in this endless search for what truly isâ€¦home." Here, Rodriguez weaves together his deeply personal and collective narratives of identity, a diverse mix of cultures, and senses of belonging.
