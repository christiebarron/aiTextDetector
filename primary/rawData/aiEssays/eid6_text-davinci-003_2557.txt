The Empire State Building was a revolutionary skyscraper, completed in 1931 and standing 103 stories tall. Its design was truly ahead of its time, incorporating novel features such as the mooring mast, an aerial platform that allowed dirigibles to dock. Despite the forward-thinking design, creating the mooring mast, and all the engineering advances needed for successful dirigible docking, was no easy feat. The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock were incredibly challenging.

The most difficult part of creating a successful mooring mast was determining an adequate design for a sturdy and secure structure. Given the experimental nature of the project, the engineers had to come up with a brand-new design that hadn't been tested before. Furthermore, since the mooring mast was ever-present danger to those boarding the dirigible, the designed mast had to be tortuous and provide a gentle landing point. Due to the complexity and scale of the project, the construction of the mooring mast required numerous simulations of the docking process in order to work out the design flaws.

Apart from the technical challenges, the builders had to endure financial restrictions. With the Great Depression in full effect, the funds were limited and needed to be carefully allocated. In an effort to keep costs low, the workers looked for ways to reduce expenditures by cutting corners with the structure of the mooring mast. This approach was not wise; the mooring mast was incredibly complex and slight changes in design could lead to significant instability. Furthermore, the cost of production was further increased by the special materials needed
