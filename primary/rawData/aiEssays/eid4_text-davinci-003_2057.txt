The ending of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho provides an instructive metaphor for resilience and regeneration. The protagonist, a young woman named Yan, contemplates her winter hibiscus flower and uses its cycle of dormancy and blooming to articulate a personal journey of potential journey and new beginnings. 

At the end of the poem, Yan reflects on her struggles to pass a required school test, saying, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Here, she draws a powerful comparison between the hibiscus’ natural cycle of rejuvenation, and her own process of renewal. During the winter months, the hibiscus is hidden away, kept safe and at rest. Likewise, Yan is taking the time to nourish herself, reflecting on where she is at and what it will take to pass the test in the future. 

Yan’s musing supports the idea that life is not linear, but cyclical. Like the hibiscus flower, we face periods of growth, dormancy, and regeneration. As long as we continue to put in the effort and believe in our own potential, we can make strides towards our goals, no matter how many times we have tried and failed before. Thus, the ending of "Winter Hibiscus" imparts an important message of hope, reminding readers that there are always opportunities for renewal and new beginnings - no matter what challenge they face.
