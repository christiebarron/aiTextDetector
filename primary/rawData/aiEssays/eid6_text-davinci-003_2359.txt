The process of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an ambitious endeavor fraught with a number of obstacles. One such obstacle was related to the building's architecture. The Empire State Building was not originally designed with a goal of allowing dirigibles to dock — it simply was not built to support a mooring mast. As such, multiple design changes were required to make the Empire State Building structurally capable of accommodating dirigibles on its roof.

The mast that was eventually built to address this obstacle was known as the “mooring mast”; this was a 300-foot steel tower weighing over 81 tons. Its construction required the support of sixteen 12-inch diameter steel columns connected to the building’s steel framework. The development of this mast was particularly difficult as it had to be built while the building was already up and running — completing the mammoth task of building the mast while maintaining clear access to the building’s internal spaces posed a real challenge.

The mast also had to be designed to be strong enough to withstand intense gusts of wind, which can often occur at high altitude due to the lack of pressure and the movement of air masses. An analysis undertaken by engineers revealed that the mast would not be able to withstand winds of more than 80 miles per hour — anything beyond that would cause it to buckle. To ensure the mast's stability, it had to be braced with a series of steel cables.

Other obstacles included the complexity of determining an efficient and safe approach for docking a dirigible on the building’s roof as well as dealing with
