I recently had to help a family member move from one side of town to the other. It seemed like it would be an easy task, but I immediately realized that there was more to do than I originally thought. Between packing the furniture, figuring out how to transport it, and saying goodbye to the old area, time was quickly running out for me to finish. 

I knew that if I tried to rush through it, I could easily damage some of the furniture, or not pack things as securely as they should be. So I took a deep breath, and tried my best to be patient as I worked. I gave myself plenty of extra time to figure out the logistics, making sure to take breaks along the way. 

In the end, I was able to finish on time and without incident. I was pleased to have been patient throughout the experience and look forward to the next move with the same approach.
