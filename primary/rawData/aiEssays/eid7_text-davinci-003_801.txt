I was on my way to work when I realized I had left my laptop at home. Instead of getting angry, I just took a deep breath and told myself that I had to be patient. I called my husband, and he offered to bring the laptop to me. He had to drive an extra 30 minutes out of his way to make that happen. I didn't want to add any stress to his day, so I just waited for him to arrive as patiently as I could.

When he finally arrived, I didn't express any anger about the situation. Instead, I thanked him for going out of his way to bring the laptop to me. We shared a few stories and some laughter before I headed off to work. In the end, my patience helped us turn a potentially stressful moment into a positive experience.
