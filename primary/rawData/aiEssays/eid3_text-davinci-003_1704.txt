The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The most significant impact is the rough, winding terrain of the road. The constant twists and turns make the journey difficult for the cyclist to traverse as he is pushed to his physical limits to stay in control of the bike. The cyclist’s lack of experience on a terrain of such difficulty is also made apparent. As the cyclist progresses further along the trail, he is met with a series of difficulties, from steep inclines to sharp declines that require the utmost concentration to navigate. The dense foliage of the woods the cyclist rides through, from the overhanging branches to the thick brush, shadows the cyclist’s path, creating an atmosphere of danger. The unpredictable nature of the terrain forces the cyclist to maintain a constant vigilance as he can never be sure what comes next. With a constant risk of rocks, roots, fallen branches, and other hidden hazards, the cyclist is often challenged to act quickly to avoid perilous circumstance. As the cyclist learns to adapt to the rapidly changing environment, it becomes apparent that the main road ahead is not a one-way street and the challenges posed offer little respite.
