As a patron of the local library, I strongly believe that censorship of library material should not be allowed. We should not censor books, music, movies, and magazines just because they contain content that is offensive or controversial. 

Censorship in libraries does nothing but infringe upon an individual’s right to free expression, and ultimately restricts learning opportunities. Libraries are sanctuaries of knowledge and information, and everyone should have the opportunity to explore and discover whatever interests them, even if it is offensive to certain people. People’s tastes are subjective and there is no one definitive answer to what constitutes “offensive” or “inappropriate” material. It should be an individual’s choice to explore or avoid particular subjects or materials as they please.

In addition, censorship ignores the fact that libraries are not only a place for recreation, but also a place for learning. Libraries should be a place where anyone can find reliable research materials, including the ones that could be deemed as “offensive” because they provide valuable insight into the human condition. Whether someone is doing research on the history of art or current events, it is important to understand all sides of the argument and gain knowledge from multiple perspectives. Everyone should have access to this material regardless of how offensive it is. 

Moreover, the American Library Association created the Library Bill of Rights which calls for materials with diverse views on controversial subjects to be present in libraries. Censorship of library materials goes against this right and creates a double standard. The benefits of access to a wide variety of materials outweigh any potential harm that
