I had been excited for weeks to go on a family trip. We had decided to take a cruise and my brother and I were very ready to get away. However, the week of our departure was not what we were hoping for. Every day it seemed like something went wrong. First, airline tickets were being cancelled, then the car developed a problem, and finally the worst happened â€“ there was a significant backlog at the port and our ship wasn't allowed to leave yet.

My brother and I were so frustrated. We had cheerfully packed our bags, but now our vacation seemed impossible. I was feeling really angry but my parents stayed calm and patient. Instead of taking their frustration out on each other, they looked for ways to make the best out of the situation. My mom found another flight for us and a mechanic to fix the car. My dad started looking up fun things we could do while we waited for the port to clear up.

My brother and I figured if our parents could stay so patient in this frustrating situation, then so could we. We looked up things we could do while waiting and made the most out of our family vacation. Eventually, we were able to take the cruise and it was an enjoyable experience.

This experience taught me that being patient and looking for ways to make the best out of difficult situations can make a big difference.
