I had recently been moved to a new office position and was feeling a bit overwhelmed. Everything was new, and I could tell that my co-workers weren't exactly thrilled to have me there. I tried hard to show them that I wanted to be part of the team and do my best, but they weren't very responsive.

One of my co-workers, however, was particularly patient with me. She recognized that I was trying my best and she went out of her way to help me settle in. She took the time to introduce me to the other staff and make sure I felt welcome. She also provided me with guidance and advice on the work I was doing and was always available to answer my questions.

I remember being so impressed by her patience. She never made me feel stupid for being new, and she could have easily just brushed me off or ignored me. Instead, she showed me a kindness and understanding that really helped me to feel more comfortable at my new job. I'm so grateful for her patience and still remember it to this day.
