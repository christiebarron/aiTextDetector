I recently had the opportunity to witness true patience. I was at an airport, and the line for customs was incredibly long. Everyone was getting impatient and snappy with the customs agents. At the back of the line, I noticed an elderly woman. Although she had approached the back of the line like everyone else, she hadn’t seemed to become impatient at all. Even as people started to complain, she simply waited her turn, smiling and serene.

Finally, it was her turn to approach the customs agent, who had become flustered at all the people complaining. The woman said nothing and simply handed over her passport and visa, waiting as he checked all the details. As it turns out, her visa had a mistake on it, and he had to redo the paperwork. She waited for an hour for the agent to finish the paperwork, but didn’t complain once – she simply waited and smiled.

Seeing her patience in the face of difficult circumstances was truly inspirational. As it turns out, the woman had been trying to visit her family in her home country for months, and her patience finally paid off. She left the airport happily, and I was so proud to have witnessed her grace and poise in such a difficult situation.
