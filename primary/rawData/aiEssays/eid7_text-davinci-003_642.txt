I remember the day my grandmother came to visit us from out of town. She was very elderly and unfortunately, her flight was delayed by several hours, causing her to arrive late in the evening. As tired as I was, I stayed up to wait for her. Her flight eventually landed, but then the luggage that she had checked got lost by the airport. With an aching back, Grandmother waited in the baggage claim area while they searched for her belongings. I sat with her, quietly offering conversation, but knowing she was too tired to do much more than sit still. We sat there for what felt like an eternity before the lost suitcase finally arrived. Finally, Grandmother and I were able to head home as she, exhausted, fell asleep in the passenger seat. 

In that moment, I was so proud of myself for being able to remain patient with my elderly grandmother. Even though it felt like we were waiting for so long, I was determined to stay and not rush. I look back on this day as a reminder that patience is always a virtue, no matter how difficult the situation may be.
