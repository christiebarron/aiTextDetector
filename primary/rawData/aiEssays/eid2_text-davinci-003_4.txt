Censorship in libraries is a highly-debated topic and one which should not be taken lightly. Libraries are commonly known as the home of knowledge and should open up the opportunity for everyone to gain knowledge in whatever form allows for the best learning. Censorship takes away the opportunity for intellectual growth and therefore should be used judiciously. 

The presence of offensive material in libraries is a valid concern. It certainly isn't appropriate for a library to contain materials that present politically or ideologically incorrect ideas or contain explicit language or images. However, it is necessary to look at censorship of library materials from two key perspectives: protecting library patrons and upholding a culture of free speech and intellectual inquiry.

When choosing materials, libraries should consider the age of the patrons and their perceived ability to handle certain topics. Although some books may contain ideas that are offensive to some people, they can still provide valuable learning opportunities for adults or those over the age of 18. Therefore, such books should not be considered for removal from the shelves.

By removing materials simply because they are deemed offensive, libraries are denying individuals the opportunity to discover different perspectives or understand difficult times. This undermines the concept of intellectual inquiry and limits people's ability to challenge existing ideas. Libraries should not shy away from controversial materials, but rather enable a balanced discussion about topics that are sensitive. 

Ultimately, libraries should continue to provide access to materials, which provide users with the opportunity to explore different topics and perspectives, while still ensuring that patrons are not exposed to offensive material. With this approach, libraries can remain a safe environment while maintaining a culture of free speech
