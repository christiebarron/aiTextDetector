I was recently running late for an appointment. I was out of breath and sweaty when I arrived, greeted by an old woman with a warm smile. “Don’t worry,” she said, “It happens to the best of us. Take your time and come in when you’re ready.” 

I was so thankful for her understanding attitude. She could have easily become frustrated with me, but instead, she was incredibly patient. I told her that I appreciated her kindness, and she replied with a laugh, “It’s not easy being on time all the time.” 

It was a small gesture, but it made a big difference in how I felt that day. Her patience showed me that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I should extend the same kindness to others. It’s something I’ll never forget.
