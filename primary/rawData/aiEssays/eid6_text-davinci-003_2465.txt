The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented a set of difficult obstacles that had to be navigated around in order to make the endeavor a reality. The construction of the “skyscraper” — which stood over 1,200 feet tall — presented a number of challenges for designing a mast for docking the large airships. 

The first challenge the builders needed to tackle was the completion of the building itself. As construction progressed and the building rose higher into the sky, the designers of the mast needed to take into account numerous factors including wind currents and air circulation. As air circulation became more and more restricted as the building grew taller, the builders had to adjust their plans accordingly to ensure that the mast could handle the wind pressure. 

Another complication with designing the mast was the need to make the tower wide enough to accommodate the size of the dirigibles. In order to make this happen, the designers had to build a tower that was wide enough to accommodate the width of the airships docking. Additionally, the docks had to be constructed out of extremely strong steel to ensure that the airship had a secure mooring. Once the dock was designed and built, the builders had to ensure that the dock could extend out of the side of the building. This was challenging due to the sheer height of the Empire State Building, but with the help of a long, special cable, the success of the project was eventually achieved.

Perhaps the most difficult hurdle for the builders of the mooring mast was the establishment of the necessary supports and cables to stabilize the airship
