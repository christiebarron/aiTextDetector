I was walking down a crowded street, lost in thought when I heard a loud laugh, it was the most infectious laugh I had ever heard. Being curious, I looked up just in time to see a girl completely unabashedly rolling on the sidewalk in barely contained joy. I couldn't help but stop and watch.

As I watched from afar, I noticed that the girl was surrounded by a group of people all smiling along with her. It was obvious, even from my distance, that these people were close to her, laughing in sympathy as if they had all experienced the same situation together.

This group of people and the joy I felt radiating from them drew me forward, and I found myself inching closer until I was eventually standing at the edge of their little circle. Taking in the scene, I discovered that the girl was surrounded by her family and friends who had taken the time to listen to her story. Every few moments, someone would ask her a question, causing her to stop and laugh uncontrollably as if a punchline had hidden itself in her words.

The laughter was contagious and before I knew it, I was part of the group, smiling and laughing along with the rest of them. We talked, exchanged stories and shared jokes for what felt like hours, I didn't get a chance to introduce myself properly but it didn't matter. In that moment, I felt connected to them, connected through the simple and powerful emotion of laughter.
