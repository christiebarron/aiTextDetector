I was out shopping with my best friend the other day, and we both started laughing about the silliest thing. We had gone into a store and both commented on a pair of slippers that had eyes on them. We both thought they were so funny and just started cracking up like crazy.

We were both laughing so hard that people started to turn around and look at us as if we were crazy. We kept laughing until my friend suggested that we actually buy the shoes. I thought this was an even better idea and so we went to look for the size we wanted. 

We ended up finding a pair that fit both of us and put them on. We walked out the shop with the eyes on our shoes still watching us, and we couldn't help but to giggle and laugh. We walked around like this, in our funny slippers, for the rest of the day, and no matter where we went, we always managed to find something to laugh about. 

It was the best day, and everywhere we went, people were looking and smiling at us. I'm certain it was because of how much we were laughing, and it was definitely one of the best days I had ever shared with my best friend.
