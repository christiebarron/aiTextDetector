The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has an immense impact on the cyclist. The conditions of the road and the environment surrounding them affects the cyclist’s ability to complete the race.

The physical layout of the road is the most prominent feature of the setting and has a negative impact on the cyclist. The road has several sharp turns, tight corners, and steep inclines. The tight curves and sharp turns increase the difficulty and complexity of the ride, making it much more difficult for the cyclist to keep their balance and maintain their momentum. The inclines add to the difficulty as the cyclist has to constantly shift gears, use their weight, and exert a great deal of energy to conquer these steep hills.

The environment surrounding the cyclist also has an effect on their performance. The weather is bitterly cold and windy, adding a degree of discomfort to the arduous ride. The cold weather causes the cyclist to work harder and sweat more, leading to fatigue and exhaustion. The howling winds make the ride even more challenging, as the cyclists have to expend extra energy to cut through the wind and cross-winds.
