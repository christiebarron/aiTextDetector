The construction of the Empire State Building was a monumental achievement of architecture, engineering, and scale. Although it was the tallest building in the world for many years, it had one other distinguishing feature; the first mooring mast designed for docking dirigibles. For the builders of the Empire State Building, this posed a number of obstacles.

The first challenge was an engineering one. The mooring mast had to be designed to take on the structural load of a large airship, as well as remain structurally secure during both docking and undocking. To add to this challenge, the mooring mast had to be able to adapt to changing airship sizes, as dirigibles changed over the years. To solve this, the mast was supported using a system of cables to allow for additional flexibility and support.

The second obstacle was the weather. Being at the top of a building that is one of the tallest in the world meant that wind and weather conditions at the mast were different than ground level. Winds at the mast were estimated to be as high as 70 mph. To be able to accommodate airships during extreme weather, the tower was built with an aerodynamic shape and was also outfitted with a wind sock and aviation beacon to warn incoming dirigibles of wind speed.

The third obstacle was the environment itself. Being several hundred feet in the air, the mooring mast had the potential to destabilize any dirigible that tried to dock, due to the turbulence of the winds at the top of the tower. To combat this issue, the mast was outfitted with large fins that helped
