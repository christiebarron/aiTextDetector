The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem ‘Winter Hibiscus’ is an inspirational representation of perseverance and determination. The protagonist is faced with the daunting prospect of taking a test, and chooses to wait until the springtime when the snows have melted and the geese have returned in order to take it.

The use of a winter hibiscus can be interpreted on multiple levels. Firstly, it may allude to the protagonist overcoming the fear of facing the consequences of the test through the resilience of the hibiscus flower. The hibiscus holds its own during the winter, fighting against the cold temperatures, and continues to grow into the springtime. This is an obvious representation of the strength and determination to succeed, even when the conditions seem impossible. 

In addition, the winter hibiscus could allude to the idea of resilience overcoming adversity, as the hibiscus manages to survive the cold and make it into the spring. This is something that is reflected in the protagonist too, who chooses to remain determined and take the test when the favourable conditions arise. This is further reinforced by the notion of returning geese, which could be interpreted as the protagonist beginning a journey towards success, or coming full circle after a period of struggle.
