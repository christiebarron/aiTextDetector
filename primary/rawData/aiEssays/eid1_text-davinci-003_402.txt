In a world that is quickly advancing with technology, it is important that we consider not just the benefits, but also the effects computers have on people. Each year, laptops, tablets and smartphones become more common, allowing us to streamline work and accomplish tasks more efficiently. However, when we are constantly relying on digital tools, it can also lead to psychological and physical health issues. 

With the prevalence of digital devices, it is increasingly difficult to disconnect from the world and take some much needed time to relax. This can result in overworked, stressed minds and bodies that don’t have the ability to recharge. Additionally, all the time spent in front of a screen can cause headaches, eyestrain, and can even affect long-term vision in some cases. 

It is essential that people take a step back from their computers and use the technology available in a proportionate manner. Participating in activities like hiking, reading and doing puzzles are great ways to help relax and recharge mentally and physically. They can also create healthy and rewarding relationships with friends and family that aren’t solely based online. 

In conclusion, computers are incredibly beneficial and can be used to our advantage, but we need to be mindful that they can also have negative effects. Human beings are not meant to be surrounded by digital devices all the time. We need to take advantage of the technology available while also maintaining balance in our lives by spending time
