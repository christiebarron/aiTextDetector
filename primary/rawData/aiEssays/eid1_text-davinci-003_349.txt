 

Dear Editor, 

Today, computers are a major technology that affects our lives in many ways. Everywhere we go, we find computers; in homes, in businesses, in schools and in almost all organizations. But, are these computers a good or a bad influence?

From my perspective, the influence of computers is mostly positive. Computers have made it easier to access information and have made us more productive in our daily lives. It has also allowed us to socialize and collaborate in ways never before imaginable and made communication easier, faster and more reliable.

At the same time, computers have also created new opportunities for social interaction and connectivity, enabling people to communicate in ways never before possible. Many companies are now using computers to facilitate collaboration among employees and even clients, resulting in rapid change and creativity.

On the other hand, however, it is also important to consider the negative effects that computers can have on our lives. The over-reliance on computers can lead to disconnect from the real world. Additionally, too much time spent in front of the computer can lead to reduced physical exercise and poor social skills. 

Therefore, I believe that technology is an important part of our lives, but it should not become a substitute for our natural social interactions and physical activity. We should take care to ensure that technology has a positive role in our lives, and not cause us to become isolated from our natural environment.

Sincerely,
