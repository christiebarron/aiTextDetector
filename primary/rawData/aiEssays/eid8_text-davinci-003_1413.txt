My friend and I were out for a walk one day and out of nowhere, it started pouring rain. We were both carrying our umbrellas but unfortunately mine was tiny and completely useless in the face of the strong downpour. We ducked into an alley nearby and started laughing as our bodies were instantly drenched.

We huddled together under the small umbrella, holding it over our heads, trying together desperately to stay dry. But soon enough, we were both completely soaked and were resigned to our fate. That's when I had an idea.

I looked at my friend and said, "Hey, imagine if we were ducks! Waddling through the alley, keeping ourselves dry beneath this tiny umbrella." Then I realized that he was looking at me with a big grin on his face. So I started to waddle around and make duck noises, flapping my arms and quacking along.

Suddenly, we were both in hysterics, laughing so hard we could hardly stand. We clung to each other for balance as we stumbled our way out of the alley and back into the rain, still holding the tiny umbrella over our heads, now with even more amusement.

That day of laughter together under the umbrella will always stay with me. It was such a simple moment, but it solidified my friendship with my pal in a unique and unexpected way. Even when we’re apart, whenever I think back to that moment I can’t help but start to giggle.
