There has been much debate over whether censorship should take place in libraries. As a patron of many libraries, I strongly agree that libraries should use discretion when it comes to certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. It is important to maintain decorum, respect, and safety in libraries and many of these materials can potentially contain offensive language and content that could be harmful for young readers.

While I understand the freedom of expression and the access to information is important, there must be some form of censorship or filter when it comes to the materials on library shelves. People of all ages frequent the libraries and, as such, there should be a focus on providing resources which are suitable for all ages. There is a place to promote freedom of expression and access to knowledge, but it should not be done as a means to disrespect, degrade, or offend anyone. 

I understand that censorship may be a difficult topic since many people believe that even works of art or fiction can be misinterpreted. This is why libraries should focus on providing materials that are generally accepted and culturally acceptable, while still giving room for the ability to freely express oneself. Libraries provide a great opportunity to explore ideas, foster creativity, and access knowledge, and should not be limited by censorship. 

In summary, libraries should use their discretion when it comes to certain materials. It is important to maintain a safe and respectful environment for everyone who visits the library. Censorship should not be used to limit access to knowledge but rather to ensure that libraries are providing resources that are suitable for all ages.
