I recently had a job interview that I was really nervous about. It had been a while since my last interview and I was scared I might not make a good impression. As I walked into the office, I saw the receptionist sitting behind her desk and immediately I felt my heart rate increase.

I tried to take a few deep breaths as she welcomed me and asked me to take a seat in the waiting area. I waited for what seemed like forever until finally the door opened and a woman stepped out and called my name.

She ushered me into her office and the interview began. As the questions started coming, I could feel myself becoming increasingly anxious and I was struggling to answer them. Whenever I'd pause, I could tell she wanted to prompt me along but she never did. Instead, she patiently waited for me to answer, understanding that I was having a hard time.

The interview eventually came to an end and as I gathered my things and thanked her for her time I was overwhelmed with gratitude for her patience. I'm not sure what would have happened if she had not been so kind and generous with her time, but I am eternally thankful.
