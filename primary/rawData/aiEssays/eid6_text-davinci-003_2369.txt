The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City was no easy feat, and neither was allowing dirigibles to dock. While the building’s architects, Adrian L. Condron and Andrew Geller and the building’s engineer, Lawrence Kahn, were determined to make this engineering marvel a reality, they faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First, the building had to be built with the capability for a dirigible to safely dock with it. The towering height of the building made this a challenge, as the winds around the rooftop were unpredictable and could be strong. To counteract this, the building’s engineers designed a Mooring Mast, which was essentially an antenna designed to give the dirigible something to grasp onto while docking with the building. This mast was an incredibly complex piece of machinery, and had to be precise to ensure the safety of the passengers and the dirigible.

Additionally, the elevator systems of the Empire State Building had to be designed to efficiently load the passengers and cargo off and onto the dirigible, as the dirigible was large and the elevator shafts were narrow. To counteract this, the building’s engineers made sure the elevators were able to move sideways, as well as vertically, allowing for more space to manage the transportation needs of both the dirigibles and their passengers. 

Finally, the building had to be outfitted with a runway on which the dirigibles could both take off and land. The law at the time restricted the length of the runway, forcing the building engineers to make multiple changes to their designs.
