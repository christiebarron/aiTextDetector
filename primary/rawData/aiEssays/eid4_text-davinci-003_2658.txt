At the end of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the protagonist, Paula, makes the rhetorical questions, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?” This is a turning point for Paula, because she is realizing that the hibiscus she has been mindfully caring for could be a symbol of her own growth and strength she has gained from her experiences. She is finally recognizing that even during the cold winter months there is still life, hope, and opportunity for growth.

Throughout the story, Paula has faced numerous challenges and obstacles such as leaving behind her beloved home of Singapore, the racism and language barriers she faced in her new home of America, and balancing her studies with her work to support her family. Though it was difficult and exhausting, she worked hard to achieve her goals of graduating and being accepted into Wisconsin Medical School. However, after realizing the steep cost of tuition, she was left feeling discouraged. She had started to doubt if she would ever be able to achieve her dream of becoming a doctor.

But the symbolism of the hibiscus and how it is in a stage of dormancy during the winter but grows with life and color each spring reflects her own growth and development in the face of all of her challenges. The hibiscus is Paula’s reminder that life has its ups and downs, but she has the inner strength, resilience, and determination to overcome her adversities and ultimately achieve her goals
