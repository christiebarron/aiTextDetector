I was at work one day, and suddenly everything started to go wrong. One problem after another popped up, leaving me overwhelmed and stressed out. It seemed my co-worker was in the same boat, but instead of panicking or getting angry, she simply took a deep breath and calmly approached each issue. She stayed positive, efficient and focused on finding a solution. I admired how she was so patient in such a difficult situation. She remained composed and solved every problem that arose in a timely manner. By the end of the day, the issues were all addressed successfully.

My co-worker's patience served as an inspiration to me and taught me how to remain composed and focused, even when things donâ€™t go as planned. We were both able to finish the day on a high note and feel accomplished by our hard work, all thanks to her patience.
