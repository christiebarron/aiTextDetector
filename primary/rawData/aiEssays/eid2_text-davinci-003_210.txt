Censorship in libraries has recently become a topic of discussion amidst increasing pressure for libraries to remove certain materials deemed offensive. As a concerned citizen, I believe that it is not the role of library administrators or other local officials to decide which materials should be removed from library shelves. 

The primary purpose of libraries is to provide a platform for free thought and creativity. Therefore, it is vital that books and other materials that may be seen as controversial are not kept off the shelves. We must recognize the presence of these materials, even if it is uncomfortable for some, because their hidden presence can only cause censorship of knowledge and opinion. Furthermore, the effect of censorship on intellectual freedom, academic inquiry, and public knowledge is far reaching and destructive. 

Moreover, it is also nearly impossible to completely censor certain materials due to the prevalence of the internet, making the task a futile effort. This only leads to the wasting of valuable resources, such as library personnel and space. Libraries that remove materials viewed as objectionable often miss the broader context and significance of the material, thus hampering open discussion.

Given these considerations, I strongly contend that libraries are fundamental to the promotion of open dialogue and the exchange of ideas. Therefore, it should not be the place of libraries to sanction materials that they deem offensive. It is vital that libraries maintain their commitment to free thought and continued learning.
