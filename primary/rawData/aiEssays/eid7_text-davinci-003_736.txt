 

Growing up, I always had a short temper. I got frustrated easily and found it hard to keep my cool in difficult situations. But, I always told myself I could and would get better. 

One time, during a project I was working on with a group at school, I faced a lot of challenges. I had to redo a lot of my work, and everyone seemed to be moving twice as fast as me, making me feel more and more upset.

At first, I wanted to just call it quits and move on, but I kept reminding myself to stay patient. I chose to breathe, think, and reset before speaking. I reminded myself that being patient was hard, and even though I wanted to give up, I never did.

Eventually, with a lot of hard work and a bit of patience, our project was finished. I felt good knowing I had overcome my own frustration and contributed to the success of the group. I could see the difference in myself and was proud that I had stayed patient despite all the obstacles.
