The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a major effect on the cyclist. The story begins in Nevada, a vast desert state with seemingly endless road and few amenities. The cyclist is faced with the daunting challenge of riding their bike for more than 350 miles with few opportunities for rest. The lack of rest stops, combined with the heat of the desert, makes the task much more difficult for the cyclist.

Not only is the cyclist faced with the physical challenge of the open road, but also the mental challenge of overcoming their doubt and weariness. Without a specific route or plan, their journey takes on a new level of difficulty.
