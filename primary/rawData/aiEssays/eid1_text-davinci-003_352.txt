 

Dear Editor,

Nowadays, computers are everywhere. They influence our lives in so many ways, and the debate about the effects computers have on people has been ongoing for quite some time. As a technology enthusiast, I strongly believe that computers have more of a positive than negative effect on people.

First and foremost, computers enhance our verbal and problem-solving skills. When used correctly, computers can teach students how to develop their communication and critical thinking skills. Furthermore, computers introduce young people to technological advancements and make them more prepared for a technological world. This is not only true for children, but for adults too. Computers provide us with countless tools that enhance peopleâ€™s ability to learn and make them more efficient.

Moreover, computers can also help people deal with mental health issues. Social networking sites, for example, can provide a safe and convenient space for people to express their feelings and opinions without fear. In addition, video games have the potential to help people reduce stress and relax by providing an environment in which they can take their minds off everyday life and concentrate on something else. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers have an overall positive effect on people. By providing us with tools to enhance our knowledge and skills, as well as providing a space in which we can relax and escape, computers can contribute substantially to our mental wellbeing.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
