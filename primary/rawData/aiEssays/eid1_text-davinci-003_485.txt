Dear Editor,

For years now, computers have been a necessity in our everyday lives. We use them for school, for work, or for entertainment purposes. However, I believe that sometimes we underestimate the effects computers have on our lives.

It is true that computers help make our lives easier in many ways. They allow us to access information quickly, communicate with friends from far away, and increase our productivity. But when used in an excessive manner, they can also cause negative effects. For example, spending too much time in front of a computer can reduce a person's physical activity, contribute to poor posture and vision problems and foster a sedentary lifestyle. Furthermore, computer use can potentially lead to social isolation and exacerbate mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.

I believe it is important to be aware of the effects computers have on our lives and take the necessary steps to counter them. People should set a limit to how much time they spend in front of their computers and, when possible, replace sedentary activities with physical activities. Also, spending time with family and friends is always beneficial, so it is important to make sure to have meaningful social interactions outside of the computer.

Thanks for reading,

[Your Name]
