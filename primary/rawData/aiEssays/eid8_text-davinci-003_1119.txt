My friend Amanda and I had been planning to go on a road trip for weeks. We had mapped out our route and chosen a destination, but all the excitement was creating a lot of stress. We had to make sure all of our camping and hiking gear was in order, and make sure we had enough money for the trip.

On the day before the trip, we decided to go out to lunch. We figured it would help us clear our minds and prepare for the upcoming journey. We chose our favorite restaurant and, as soon as we sat down, we started talking a mile a minute.

One thing led to another and, before we knew it, we were both laughing hysterically. We couldn’t remember what started our laughing fit, but it didn’t matter. All that mattered was that we were both having a good time and taking the stress out of our situation.

The laughter was contagious; the whole restaurant was laughing along with us. It was the best side effect of our lunch break, and it stayed with us for the entire trip. We both felt relaxed, refreshed and ready for the journey ahead of us. It was a wonderful reminder that laughter really can go a long way.
