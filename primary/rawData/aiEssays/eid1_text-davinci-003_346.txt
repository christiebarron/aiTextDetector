Dear Editor,

I write to express my opinion regarding the effects of computers on society. While these machines are undoubtedly essential for modern living, I believe they bring a number of negative effects.

In the first place, computers facilitate an isolated lifestyle in which people remain isolated from their peers and communities. Hours spent inside alone in front of a keyboard can breed a lack of cohesion with those around us and their struggles in life. Additionally, computers often provide us with an infinite supply of information and opportunities, however they can also be used to distract us from the reality of our lives and make us forget what matters in the real world.

Furthermore, computers can often encourage unhealthy habits and addictions. The internet is filled with games, movies and other content that can be both stimulating and damaging to our mental wellbeing. Access to any and all information on the world wide web gives us a false sense of omniscience, which can lead to unrealistic expectations of our own capabilities and an incessant pursuit of knowledge.

Finally, the physical impact of computers cannot be overlooked. Staring at a screen for extended periods of time can take its toll on an individualâ€™s eyesight, often resulting in headaches and disturbed vision. Not to mention, many sedentary hours spent in front of a laptop have been linked to a number of health issues such as obesity and depression.

Despite the various detrimental effects of computers, I cannot advocate for their complete removal from society. I
