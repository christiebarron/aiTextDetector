I was at the store buying ingredients for dinner, when all of a sudden, a crowd of people rushed past me, pushing me to one side. I could feel my temper rising â€“ I had been trying to get what I needed quickly so I could go home and start dinner.  

But before I could get angry, I realized that the people were running away from something happening further down the aisle. A small child had stumbled and fallen, and was now crying loudly, scared and hurt. 

The parents were beside themselves, trying to calm the little one up and take care of the wound. I found myself stepping in and asking if the family needed help getting the injury cleaned up and bandaged. Even though I had to wait even longer to get my shopping done, I wasn't impatient or frustrated. 

The parents were so thankful as I stayed and helped, soothing their child and helping them get bandaged up. In the end, the child stopped crying and was smiling as I said goodbye. 

In that moment, I realized how being a little patient and understanding could go a long way. It was definitely worth the wait.
