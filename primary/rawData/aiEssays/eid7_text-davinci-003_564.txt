I remember one time when I was helping my grandmother move from her old house to a new one. It was a big job and it was going to take a long time. I was happy to help her, but I knew it was going to be difficult. 

She had a lot of belongings and it was slow going getting all of the boxes loaded into the moving truck. To make it even more challenging, it was a hot summer day and the truck did not have air conditioning. 

I could tell that my grandmother was getting tired and frustrated, but she never complained. Instead she kept encouraging me that it was almost done and that we would be rewarded with a nice meal when we finished. 

Finally, after a few hours of hard work, we were done. We went out and had a nice dinner together and it was worth it. Even when things got tough my grandmother remained patient, and I'm very proud of her for that.
