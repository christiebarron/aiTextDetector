The builders of the Empire State Building encountered difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles, large airships which were commonly used for passenger travel during the 1930s, to dock at the building. These obstacles stemmed from the nature of the building design, featuring a much narrower body than the size of the dirigibles, and the sheer height and weight of the airships. 

The primary challenge the builders had to solve was finding a secure way to attach the airship to the Empire State Building without any parts of it scraping against the building and creating damage. In order to accomplish this, the builders began by installing a mooring mast upon the building. The mooring mast was a tall steel apparatus with a flat platform on the top and four large mooring cables descending from it. The top of the mast was approximately the same size as the gondolas on the airships, and could be used as a platform for passengers to stand. 

The mooring mast was designed to be secure enough to satisfy the needs of the airship companies and prevent any accident or safety risk. The mooring cables were strong enough to withstand the weight of the airships and the rigidity of the mooring mast prevented the airships from dropping too low, while the flat platform allowed the ships to remain tethered without risk of scraping against the building. The mooring cables were also adjustable so they could be adjusted to fit the size and weight of each dirigible. 

Oversight by the Civil Aeronautics Board helped the builders understand the regulations required for airships to
