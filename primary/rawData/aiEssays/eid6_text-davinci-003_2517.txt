At first glance, it may appear that the idea of constructing a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock with the Empire State Building was simply a matter of affixing the necessary infrastructure to the upper part of the Art Deco skyscraper. However, as detailed in Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's article, The Mooring Mast, the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced were complicated and considerable. 

The first challenge was a matter of logistics. Since the mooring mast was to be placed at the highest point on the Empire State Building, it was reasoned that the mast must be positioned around the upper roof. This would, however, require the roof's coping to be removed - a difficult and tedious task. In order to keep the roof unchallenged, the architecture firm, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon determined to have the mooring mast come out of the side of the building instead. As the firm worked to solve this puzzle, other problems arose.

The height of the mast, of course, required special permission from the Federal Aviation Administration and careful engineering design in order to minimize any potential risks and hazards. Furthermore, though the idea of a mooring system had been suggested before, never before had it been attempted on such a grand scale as the Empire State Building. The technology of the day also meant that constructing the mast from the ground up would be dangerous and inefficient; the mast had to be constructed from the top down. 

Finally, the architects and engineers designing the mooring mast were also tasked with ensuring the stability of the airship when
