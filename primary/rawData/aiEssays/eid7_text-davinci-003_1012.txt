 

I was at the grocery store the other day with my five year old daughter, who was running around and not listening to me at all. I could feel my frustration levels rising with every passing second. But, I kept reminding myself to stay calm and be patient.

I took a deep breath and focused on making the shopping experience an enjoyable one. I asked her to help me pick out which fruits and vegetables we would like for the week and to point out any fun snacks she thought we should bring home. She started to become excited about being able to 'help' me and then we continued shopping in a calm and relaxed environment. 

I noticed that other customers in the store were beginning to make remarks and look at us with judgmental attitudes. I remained patient and smiled at them, and eventually they moved out of the aisle. 

Seeing my daughter calm down and have a great time at the store made me so proud. I realized that I had done the right thing by remaining patient in the moment. On our way back home, I told my daughter that the best way to find solutions that work for everyone is to remain patient even when it feels like things are overwhelming.
