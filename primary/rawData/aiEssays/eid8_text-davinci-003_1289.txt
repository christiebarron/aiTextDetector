I have this friend I've known since I was in fourth grade. We've always had an easy banter and a tendency to laugh at each other's jokes, sharing a unique camaraderie. About a year ago, we decided to take a road trip together to see some old friends we hadn't seen in years. 

We spent the first day of the trip talking and laughing as we drove, re-living all of our fond memories and funny stories along the way. Hours flew by in what felt like minutes as we continued driving, of course pausing for some sight-seeing and restroom stops in the process. 

It was day two of our road trip and we had been driving for hours longer than planned after missing our turn and our mistake had us a good bit away from our destination. We were both hungry, frustrated and exhausted. We had been at a stand-still on a bridge for what felt like forever and to break the tension we both began laughing hysterically. 

After that, all of our frustration simply melted away. We kept going, laughing and joking all the way until we got to our destination, hardly noticing the long hours of driving left. To this day, we still laugh about that wonderful moment on the bridge and how it changed our entire road trip.
