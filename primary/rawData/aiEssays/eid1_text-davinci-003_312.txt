Dear Editor,

I am writing in regards to the effects computers have on people today. It is clear that our lives are becoming increasingly reliant on technological advancements, and computers are no exception. We are increasingly reliant on them to help us with our daily tasks - to learn, to communicate, to stay informed, and to even keep us entertained. 

As with any technology, there are both positive and negative implications. I'd like to focus on the positives here. In our current climate, people are more connected than ever before. We now have the capability to bridge gaps among people all over the world. Computers can also be a foster learning and creativity, offering complex simulations and games to stimulate the mind. Additionally, our day-to-day tasks are made simpler. Many aspects of our lives, including work, shopping, banking, and other financial and organizational tasks, are made much easier by computers. 

However, it is important to note that too much reliance on computers can have a detrimental effect. We can become too reliant on the convenience they provide, and lose touch with reality. It is important to remember to find a balance.

I believe that, overall, computers are a beneficial tool, and provide incredible opportunities to people of all ages. We should continue to use them in a positive manner and find a balance in our daily lives. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
