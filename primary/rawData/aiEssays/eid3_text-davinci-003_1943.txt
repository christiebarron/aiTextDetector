The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski have a significant effect on the cyclist. 

The setting of the story is a road in the mountains. The cyclist is taking a long journey and must face whatever challenges the mountain road has in store for him. 

In this setting, the cyclist must deal with a variety of obstacles. These obstacles include steep hills, winding turns, and rugged terrain. The cyclist must use his strength, speed, and agility to navigate these difficult roads. He must also contend with the ever-changing weather conditions. It is often difficult to tell what the cyclist will encounter during his journey, as the weather changes quickly and unexpectedly. 

The winding turns of the road make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain momentum. In order to keep up his speed, the cyclist must make frequent stops to check his bearings and brace himself for the next challenge. This is draining on the cyclistâ€™s energy and slows down his progress. 

The rugged terrain also makes the journey difficult. The cyclist must be cautious of rocks, branches, tree stumps, and mud. He must maneuver around these obstacles while still keeping an eye on the road.
