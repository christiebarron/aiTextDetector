I had been looking forward to my vacation for weeks. I was packing my bags, barely containing my excitement, when I noticed that an important work file had been left behind. I had been counting on a break away but I knew that I couldn't leave until the task was done.

I took a few deep breaths and told myself to be patient. I got to work on the project straight away and had a strong focus to get the job done. I worked hard and finally finished up late in the evening. 

By that time I was feeling frustrated, but I reminded myself that being patient was the best course of action. After all, the work I was doing was important, and I was able to finish the task in a timely manner.

Finally, I was able to get on the road, take a deep breath, and enjoy the rest of my vacation. Thanks to my patience, I was able to stay on top of my work and enjoy some much needed rest and relaxation.
