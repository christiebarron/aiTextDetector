 

I was recently on a road trip with a couple of friends and it was going pretty smoothly. But on the last day, our car started having mechanical difficulties. We had to pull over, put the car on the side of the road, and wait for a tow truck. I was frustrated and ready to get home after days of being away. 

My friends were also very impatient, complaining about the wait and how much time we were wasting. But I had to set a good example, so instead of getting angry, I tried to stay positive and patient. I talked to them about the importance of patience and tried to help keep the mood light with jokes.

We ended up waiting for the tow truck for about four hours. It felt like eternity, but having patience and a positive attitude helped make this tedious situation more bearable. In the end, my friends thanked me for my patience and said it made the situation a lot easier.
