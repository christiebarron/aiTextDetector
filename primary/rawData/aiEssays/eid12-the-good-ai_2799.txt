Is it morally acceptable to kill 10 people to save 100?
The question of whether it is morally acceptable to kill 10 people to save 100 is a complex and controversial one. On the one hand, the utilitarian argument would suggest that such an action is justified if it results in the greatest good for the greatest number of people. However, on the other hand, many argue that taking innocent lives is never justified, regardless of the potential benefits. 
One way to approach this question is through a thought experiment. Imagine that you are in charge of a train that is hurtling towards a group of 100 people who are tied to the tracks. You have two options: you can either do nothing and allow the train to hit them, or you can divert the train onto another track where only 10 people are tied up. What should you do? 
From a utilitarian perspective, it would seem obvious that you should choose to divert the train onto the track with fewer people. After all, by doing so, you would be saving 90 lives at the cost of only 10. This seems like a clear case where sacrificing some lives for others would result in greater overall happiness and well-being. 
However, there are several objections to this line of reasoning. One objection is based on deontological ethics – that is, ethical principles based on duty and obligation rather than consequences. According to this view, there are certain actions (such as killing innocent people) that are always wrong regardless of their consequences. 
Another objection comes from virtue ethics – which focuses on developing moral character rather than following rules or maximizing outcomes. From this perspective, killing innocent people would be seen as incompatible with being a virtuous person. 
Furthermore, even if we accept utilitarianism as our ethical framework for making decisions about life and death situations like these ones - there may still be reasons why we might hesitate before choosing to kill ten individuals in order save hundred others. 
For example - what if those ten individuals were children or infants? Would we still be willing to sacrifice their lives for the sake of others? What if they were elderly or disabled individuals who were unable to defend themselves? Would it be morally acceptable to kill them in order to save others who were younger and healthier? 
Another issue that arises when considering this question is the potential for unintended consequences. For example, what if killing those ten people leads to a chain of events that ultimately results in even more deaths or suffering? Or what if it sets a dangerous precedent that justifies future acts of violence against innocent people? 
Ultimately, there are no easy answers when it comes to questions of life and death. While utilitarianism may suggest that sacrificing some lives for others is justified in certain circumstances, other ethical frameworks may lead us to different conclusions. Moreover, even within utilitarianism itself - there may be reasons why we might hesitate before choosing to kill ten individuals in order save hundred others. 
In conclusion, the question of whether it is morally acceptable to kill 10 people to save 100 is a difficult one with no clear answer. While utilitarianism suggests that such an action may be justified if it results in greater overall happiness and well-being, other ethical frameworks raise objections based on duty, virtue ethics or unintended consequences. 
Ultimately - each individual must weigh up the various factors involved and make their own decision about what they believe is right or wrong in these situations. However - one thing remains clear: any decision involving life and death should never be taken lightly or without careful consideration of all relevant factors involved.
