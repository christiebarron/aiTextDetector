I remember the day I had with my husband so clearly. We had just finished a romantic dinner, and had decided to take a dreamy walk in the park afterward. While making our way over to the picnic tables, we started talking about our favorite places in the world, and as we crossed an area, we noticed a very large conch shell. We both knew immediately that it was meant for us to find and take with us. 

We both got a good chuckle out of the idea that we happened to stumble upon the shell, and we picked it up and took it with us. We continued with our conversation while assigning the shell silly tasks to keep it busy. We were both laughing so hard, our sides were hurting by the time we reached the picnic tables.

We continued with our conversation and eventually made it to the end of the park, taking the conch shell with us. Whenever we tell the story, we both just can't help but break out in laughter. It's truly been one of our favorite memories together, and a reminder of the joy that laughter can bring.
