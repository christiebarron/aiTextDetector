I remember when I was a student in college. I had a really difficult professor who would give complex, obscure reading assignments and then ask trick questions at the end of class. It was very intimidating, and there were times when I felt completely overwhelmed and discouraged. But instead of giving up, I chose to be patient and determined.

I spent extra time studying, read all of the material as thoroughly as I could, and even went to my professor office hours for help if I got stuck. I also worked hard to improve my writing skills and kept practicing until I felt confident enough to take the test. 

Eventually, I got the grades I wanted in the course and it made me so proud of myself. That experience taught me that anything is possible if you are willing to work hard and show patience.
