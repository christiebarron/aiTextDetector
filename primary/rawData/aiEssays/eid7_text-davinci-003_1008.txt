I recently went to the store to do some grocery shopping. When I arrived, there were a lot people in line and I knew it would take a while for my turn to come. I got in line and started waiting, but as the line proceeded slowly I started feeling frustrated. I started tapping my foot and moving impatiently. Then, I remembered one of my favorite quotes, “patience is a virtue”. Seeing that the line was not going to move quickly and wanting to practice patience, I decided to use that time to do some of my work instead. I started by reading some articles and slowly my frustration passed away as I felt more productive. After some time, it was my turn and I felt much more peaceful. I believe that being patient can help us feel more peaceful and productive.
