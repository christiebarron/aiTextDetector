The notion of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building was an ambitious endeavor met with many obstacles. This engineering feat was first proposed by American industrialist and philanthropist John Raskob in 1931, who saw the project as an innovative way to expand New York City's infrastructure and bolster business for the time. The idea was met with enthusiasm and hope, but soon the builders of this mooring mast came face-to-face with a litany of difficulties.

The first and perhaps most overwhelming obstacle was the sheer weight of the mast, a 200-foot tall steel structure intended to support up to five dirigibles at a time. Constructing such a robust and tall structure was an incredibly difficult undertaking, especially given the technology of the time. Connecting the mast to the Empire State Building was an additional challenge, as the building's comparatively weak design structure could not sufficiently support the added weight of the mast. 

Furthermore, the concept of the dirigibles docking tower was an unprecedented one, making it difficult for the builders to determine the necessary safety protocols for such a project. Chiefly, the engineers needed an adequate system of pulleys, brakes, and counterweights to make sure the mast was maintained in a stable position. To complicate matters further, they also had to consider the need for wind measurements in order to ensure that the winds of the area were strong enough to allow the dirigibles to dock safely. 

Ultimately, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face a host of technical complications. Construction of the mast proved to be an arduous challenge, given its
