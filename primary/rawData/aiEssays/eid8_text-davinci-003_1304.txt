I was on a date with a guy I had been seeing for a few weeks. We had been getting much closer and I was feeling very comfortable around him. 

On this particular night, we decided to go out for dinner and drinks. We had a great time and the conversation was flowing easily. When the waiter brought out the dessert, I couldn't help but mischievously hide a strawberry from my plate, by tucking it between my thumb and index finger.

I glanced up from the plate and our eyes met. I knew exactly what he was thinking. We were both suppressing a smile, but it was obvious to both of us that if one of us laughed, the floodgates would open. 

A long moment passed and suddenly he started to laugh. It was contagious, and before I knew it, I was laughing too. We both had huge grins on our faces and I felt a connection form between us in that moment. 

It wasn't a big moment, but it was special nonetheless. The laughter brought us closer together and it was the catalyst for the strong bond that we now share.
