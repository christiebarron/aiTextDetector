I was recently stuck in traffic for two hours. My car stopped working and I had to wait for an emergency tow truck to come and help me out. Despite the long wait and the frustration of not being able to reach my destination, I remained patient and calm. I kept myself distracted by listening to music and by talking to the people around me. I was also grateful that I was in a safe public space and not in any danger. In the end, the tow truck came right on time and I was able to get back on the road. Being patient during the situation allowed me to get out of the situation with a good attitude and no stress.
