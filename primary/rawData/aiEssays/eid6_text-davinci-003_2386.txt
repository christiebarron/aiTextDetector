The building of the Empire State Building marked a major milestone in American architecture. As the tallest building in the world at the time of its completion, the Empire State Building was truly an architectural marvel. Yet along with its impressive stature, the construction of the Empire State Building presented unique challenges for the designers and builders working on the project—particularly when it came to allowing for the docking of dirigibles.

The concept of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building was envisioned by its developers almost as soon as the plans for the building were first drawn up. Yet, figuring out a way to make such a feat achievable was anything but simple. The idea of attaching a structure strong enough to support the weight of a large airship at the top of an already towering skyscraper presented an immense engineering challenge.

Ultimately, the stratagem proposed by George H. Burgess, a mooring mast inventor working for the Empire State Building Company, came to be the most feasible solution. As described in The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, Burgess devised a novel design for a mooring mast that would be tall enough and sturdy enough to anchor a dirigible in place atop the building. This design would include a small mast attached to a platform atop the highest floors of the building, as well as a system of counterbalances and harnesses that could be used to secure the airship’s lines to the mooring mast.

Aside from the engineering challenges faced in designing the mooring mast, there were also numerous practical considerations the builders faced in implementing this concept
