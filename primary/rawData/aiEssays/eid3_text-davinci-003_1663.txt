In Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting play an important role in how the cyclist experiences the ride.

The cyclist's journey was on a poorly-maintained road, making for a difficult, uncomfortable ride. As soon as he set off, the cyclist was met with obstacles such as deep potholes and washboards, forcing him to constantly adjust his posture and muscular tension in order to maintain control. The roughness of the road also made it slow and draining work, causing him to become exhausted much faster than he would if the road had been in better condition.

The cyclist was also very aware of the long, lonely stretches of road in between towns, making it easier for him to focus on navigating the rough terrain and tough conditions. The lack of life or distractions also meant that the cyclist was constantly in tune with his environment and was able to respond quicker to any changes in the road.

The harshness of the environment was also a constant source of danger - any wrong move could lead to a serious injury. It made the ride even more difficult, as the cyclist had to think carefully about his actions and plan for any potential contingencies.
