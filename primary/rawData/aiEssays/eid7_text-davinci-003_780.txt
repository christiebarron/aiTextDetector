I was recently in line at a grocery store and the cashier was having a difficult time ringing up the person in front of me. They had a bunch of coupons and it was taking a while. I could see the cashier was getting overwhelmed and it seemed like they were new. 

As the cashier was struggling with the tricky coupons, I took a step back and reminded myself to be patient. I held back any urge to become frustrated and instead smiled at the cashier to help them stay calm. I started to say something kind to help put that person at ease, but I thought better of it and figured it would be more helpful to remain silent. 

I waited patiently for what felt like a long time until finally, the cashier managed to get the person's total. Once they were done, I stepped forward cheerfully and said hi. I could tell the cashier was relieved and I was proud of myself for remaining composed throughout the situation. 

Being patient is not always easy, but it's important to keep our cool and be supportive when others are struggling.
