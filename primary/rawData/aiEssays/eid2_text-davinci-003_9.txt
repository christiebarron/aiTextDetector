Censorship in libraries is important topic in today’s society. Should materials like books, music, movies, and magazines be removed from library shelves when they are found to be offensive? 

The library is a place of learning, exploration and discovery. With this in mind, it should be a place where all individuals, no matter of their beliefs, can access information on a range of topics. When a book, a movie, or a song is labelled as offensive by one person, it enforces a certain kind of censorship on others’ right to information. On the other hand, some individuals would argue that certain materials should be censored in order to protect children from potentially damaging concepts. 

I believe that materials that are deemed offensive should not necessarily be banned from libraries – library professionals should instead tackle the issue with open dialogue and education. There is increasing evidence that censorship has a negative effect on developing minds, affecting the ability to make independent decisions and form opinions. Thus, as a society, we should allow access to materials that some people may find offensive and instead provide education on the subject. 

Library professionals should carefully consider the challenges posed by offensive materials and make informed decisions about which items should be allowed on the shelves. Library policies regarding sensitive materials should consider public opinion and concerns, however it is important not to restrict access to information. Libraries should provide resources to help patrons, particularly children, navigate through difficult topics and make informed choices.

Though there are strong arguments in favour of censorship, library professionals must make decisions which give patrons the freedom to access any resources they want without fear. Libraries
