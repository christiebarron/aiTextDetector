I remember it like it was yesterday- it was the first time I had laughed with my now girlfriend. We had been on a few dates, but had been too shy to show our true selves with each other.

That evening, I was meant to take her to dinner and then a movie, but just before we left, I decided to get a little silly and play a game of Truth or Dare. It wasn't long before she was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down her cheeks!

After that night, it felt like things between us really changed. We were both more comfortable around each other and had shared something so special that no one else knew about. It felt like friendship had unlocked. We both knew that evening marked the beginning of something special between us.

So now, every time we laugh together I'm reminded of that night. It's a special moment for us and it reminds us of how far we've come. Every time we find ourselves laughing, I feel a tingle of warmth that reminds me of that evening. We both know it was the evening laughter brought us closer together.
