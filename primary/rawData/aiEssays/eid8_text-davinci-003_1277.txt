I remember the first time I truly laughed with my best friend. We had been friends for a while but it was the first time I felt that connection that could only come from genuine laughter.

It started out innocently enough. We made plans to hang out and watch a movie. We sat down and chose a romantic comedy that neither of us had seen before. I was a bit apprehensive since I hadn’t laughed genuinely in a while.

But, from the opening credits, we could not stop laughing. I had forgotten how freeing and wonderful it felt to laugh with a friend like this. We had tears streaming down our faces and couldn’t believe that some of the moments were so absurdly funny. The more we laughed, the better the movie seemed to get.

We finished the movie, complete with snacks and conversation. We had truly connected with each other that day and took away a friendship that would last forever. Laughter is indeed the shortest distance between two people and I’m so thankful that my best friend and I were able to experience it fully that day.
