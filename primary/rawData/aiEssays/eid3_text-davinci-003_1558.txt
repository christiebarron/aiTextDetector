The setting of Joe Kurmaski's story 'Rough Road Ahead' is essential in conveying the struggle of the cyclist in his journey. The foreboding and stark mountain landscape, with its steep and jagged terrain and rough path, haphazardly curves up the side of the mountain. This environment serves to further the intensity of the cyclist's journey and his challenge along the way. Subtle details, such as the rocky road, the winding path, and the wind and chill of the air, are all implicit in the setting, and they work to add greater depth and reality to the character's struggles.

The steep incline of the mountain challenges the cyclist's strength and grit, while the rough terrain tests his determination. The mountain, covered with rocks and in some places boulders, serves to make the cyclist's attempts toward the top all the more difficult. Having to traverse the various rock formations and climb over the rocky ledges only adds to the intensity of the struggle.

The windy chill of the air that cuts through the cyclist's sweat further highlights the trying challenges he faces, adding to the sense of his harrowing ride. The feeling of loneliness is also heightened by the expansive, unmoving landscape.
