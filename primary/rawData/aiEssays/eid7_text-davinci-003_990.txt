I had recently started a new job and it was full of challenges. I was asked to complete a difficult task that my colleagues had found impossible to complete. I was determined to give it a try and I sat down and worked for days, only to find that it was indeed an impossible task. 

I was frustrated, yet I kept my composure and kept on trying. My determination was rewarded when I finally worked out a solution. After all my hard work, it had worked out well in the end. I was thankful that I was patient and was able to find a solution.
