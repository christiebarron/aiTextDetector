The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the world-famous landmark. First and foremost, the 1932 design of the building had to be altered to accommodate the specific needs of dirigibles. The concept of a “mooring mast” containing a platform at the top and an elevator to the platform was first proposed by Colonel Roscoe Turner. This would provide an area for the blimp to attach and provide a safe area for passengers to disembark. 

The challenge, however, was that the building had already been almost completed at this point. Going back to make changes would prove to be extremely costly, as the entire top of the building would have to be redesigned and strengthened. This would require the construction of a steel cage to the top of the building’s exterior, as well as the installation of steel cables and rigging inside the building’s frame. Even if this was achieved, the other elements needed for a successful docking would still be required, including flags, warning lines, and powerful searchlights.

In addition to this, the construction team needed to work in partnership with the Port Authority to come up with safety regulations and procedures. This would involve considerations regarding the type and size of dirigible which would be allowed to dock. Accommodating a blimp would involve a different set of engineering requirements, such as the design of the mast, the height of the mooring lines, and the position of the elevator. 

Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building achieved their goal, and the first
