It had been less than a week since I had started my first job after college and had moved to a new city, so I was a little uncomfortable being around my coworkers. We had an ice-breaker game in our first meeting and I was worried that I wouldn't fit in. That's when something unexpected happened.

One of the team members said something witty and everyone burst out laughing. For a moment, I felt so awkward as I looked around at everyone having a good time. Then, I noticed my new boss laughing harder than anyone else. I hadn't heard her laugh before and it gave me an unexpected sense of relief.

I let out a chuckle and soon enough the laugh was contagious. This went on for several minutes and I noticed that my anxiety was slowly fading. As my laughter subsided and the others eventually quietened down, I looked up and smiled. There was now a sense of familiarity in the office, something I had been missing in my life for a long time.

My new boss had noticed how I had been feeling out of place and she had opened up the laughter to make me feel more comfortable. Iâ€™ll never forget the power of that moment or how it made me smile inside. Since then, my new coworkers and I have grown closer, thankful for such a strong initial connection. Laughter really does bridge gaps and warm relationships like no other.
