I remember it so vividly. It was a Saturday afternoon, and my best friend, Eric, and I had just picked up lunch at the local diner. We were walking back to school, eating our burgers and trying to make conversation in between bites. 

We were talking about all kinds of random stuff, like our classes that week and what we had planned for the upcoming weekend, but we just weren't quite hitting stride. I still remember how awkward the conversation felt. 

But then, out of nowhere, Eric stopped mid-sentence and suddenly erupted with laughter. I thought he had gone crazy and couldn't help but stare at him with a look of confusion. But then finally it all made sense - I had gotten lettuce from my burger stuck in my braces, and without a word, it had made us both laugh uncontrollably. 

After that, it felt like a weight had been lifted and the rest of our walk back was full of laughter. The more we talked, the more jokes and funny stories we shared, and all of a sudden the awkwardness we had felt before was gone.

It reminded me of the power of laughter and how it can bridge gaps between two people. To this day, I smile every time I think back to that moment with my best friend and all the laughter it brought with it.
