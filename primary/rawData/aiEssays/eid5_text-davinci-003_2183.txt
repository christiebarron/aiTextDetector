Referencing childhood stories and dreams of moments forever gone that listlessly linger in his adult life, such images set a tone of searching and loss.

Its constant cycle of searching and reflective longing captures fittingly what many have gone through in the process of assimilation, identity and a re-discovery of home. Through a combination of captivating stories, vivid imagery and insight, Rodriguez creates a mood that resonates deeply.
