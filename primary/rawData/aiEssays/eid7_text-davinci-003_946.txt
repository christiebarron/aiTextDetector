I had a long day at work, and I was exhausted by the time I made it home. My husband had cooked dinner, but there was one minor issue: he forgot to buy the ingredients for the salad. I immediately felt a wave of frustration, but I took a deep breath and reminded myself to be patient.

I asked my husband if he could go to the store for the items and he agreed. He apologized for forgetting, but I told him it was alright. As he left, I took a few moments to gather myself and focus on being patient. 

An hour later he returned with the items, but I was already done with dinner. I asked him if he still wanted to eat, and he said yes. So, I put the food aside, reheated it, and sat down with him to share a meal.

Even though I was annoyed, I kept my frustration in check. I knew it was important to be patient and understanding so I put my energy into being kind. Through it all, I remembered how much I care for him and I was thankful he remembered to get the items. 

Things could’ve easily spiraled down a route of negativity, but I chose the path of patience that day. It was a good reminder of its value and that it’s worth the effort.
