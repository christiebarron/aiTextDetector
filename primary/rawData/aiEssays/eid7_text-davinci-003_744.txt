I recently had the privilege of watching my niece in band practice. The band teacher was taking them through the same song over and over again, and there were many moments when the members of the band were getting frustrated and starting to groan and mumble. However, my niece stayed focused and kept persisting. Every time they made a mistake, she kept trying and never complained. She was patient and understanding even though it was taking her a while to get the song right. I was impressed by the level of focus and determination she had, even though it was taking a long time. Seeing her example of patience and tenacity gave me insight into the importance of patience and how it can pay off in the end. I'm truly so proud of her for having that perseverance and dedication.
