I had grown up feeling disconnected from much of the world. As an introvert, I found it difficult to connect with friends and family in an easy or effortless way, so when I met my closest friend, Cara, it felt like a revolutionary experience. She was unlike anyone else I had ever met - funny, warm, and with a brilliant sense of humor.

On the first day we met, Cara and I were doing a group project for college. We had to come up with a creative idea for the class, and, though we didn't necessarily agree with each other, we found ourselves laughing more and more throughout the meeting. We laughed about our differences of opinion, about our shared obstacles, and about the tiny quirks and mistakes we made as we worked.

At the end of the day, I was exhausted from all the laughing, but in a good way! I felt lighter and more connected to Cara in just a few hours, and our friendship has only grown deeper since then. We still laugh together all the time, whether it's a joke we heard, something ridiculous one of us said, or a little indiscretion we made. Laughter has become a key part of our friendship, and I'm grateful to have a friend that I can laugh and be light-hearted around.
