The Empire State Building is an iconic symbol of New York City, and to this day draws tourists from around the world. Built in the early 1930s, this architectural marvel was the first skyscraper to have an exclusive rooftop mooring mast designed specifically to dockdirigibles. While this was groundbreaking technology at the time, it didn’t come without its challenges. 

One of the biggest obstacles the Empire State Building’s builders faced in creating a safe and usable docking port for the airships was their sheer size. Dirigibles are much larger than other aircraft, having longer and wider bodies. To ensure a dock that could safely receive and dispatch these vessels, the building’s architects had to build a mooring mast that was one-hundred, thirty-one feet tall and secured to the roof with four anchors. 

A second issue the Empire State Building’s builders had to solve was how to protect the mooring mast from inclement weather and high winds. To help combat these issues, the skyscraper’s engineers constructed four guy wires alongside the mooring mast to provide additional support. Because of their influence on air-flow patterns, the guy wires also served to reduce turbulence and increase stability around the mast. As a result, the wind speed at the mooring mast was kept to a minimum for a safe docking landing.  

Other obstacles the Empire State Building’s builders had to tackle included potential fire risks, and how to deal with emergency landings or rescues at the dock. To ensure that the mooring mast
