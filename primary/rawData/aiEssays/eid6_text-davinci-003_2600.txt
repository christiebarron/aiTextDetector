One of the greatest engineering challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in New York City was to create a docking station for dirigibles, or airships. Until fanatically solved in a 1939 engineering feat, no safe, secure station had been constructed in the world at the time. The challenges facing the engineers were manifold, and although ultimately successful, the final solution was wrought through much innovation and experimentation.

Perhaps the greatest challenge to creating a safe, secure mooring mast was the location of the building itself. Located in an ultra urbanity setting, surrounded by other buildings, the Empire State Building was a tight fit for the docking of large dirigibles. Winds and congestion presented significant challenges. Consequently, an innovative design was needed in order to ensure that the airship moored on its way up to the mast. It needed to be able to start and stop safely without any collisions.

In order to ensure the security of the mooring, two main components were needed: a heavy breeching chain to keep the airship secure and a winch to control the chain and to facilitate letting it out. The chain itself weighed in excess of four tons, and the winch itself weighed in excess of five hundred pounds, creating a challenge in finding ways to launch and secure these heavy components safely. Additionally, the machinery to facilitate loading and unloading of the airships needed to be created, and engineers also had to find a way to work around the fact that mooring on to the high rise would require double-stacking of the airships themselves. 

The sheer complexity of the
