The builders of the Empire State Building faced an interesting challenge in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic New York City structure. Built in 1930, the Empire State Building was originally designed to provide a mooring mast for passengers to exit airships using an elevator. 

The process of planning the mooring mast was extensive, as how the structure was to be built and how the mooring mast would fit within the existing building design were both major considerations. The building's design placed the mast at the rapidly developing skyline of New York City, while its surrounding area was in the middle of an area dense with other high-rise buildings, power lines, and cables. As a result, builders needed to ensure the mooring mast was tall enough for the airships to dock, but not tall enough to interfere with the other buildings or power lines.

The challenge of creating a dock that was both high enough and low enough, as described in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, sparked an innovative idea - builders decided to construct a bristle of sixteen steel cables placed in a "X" shape, allowing the dirigible to maneuver around the surrounding structures while it was being tied to the Empire State Building.

The final planning stage before the mast was to be built was to create a special elevator. The elevator, which had to accommodate both passengers and a considerable amount of weight, was created to move airship passengers from the underside of the airship to the building entrance at the thirtieth floor. This was an incredibly important element in the plan, as it
