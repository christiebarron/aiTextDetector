I remember one time when I was about 10 years old that I had to wait for my turn to hit a hole-in-one at a mini-golf course. It was my little brother's birthday and his friends were all so eager to show off their golfing skills. I watched as each of them took turns, hitting their ball over and over again, some of them even taking multiple attempts. I could have gotten frustrated at the time it was taking, but I was determined to stay patient.

Sure enough, it was finally my turn. I took a deep breath and concentrated hard, aiming carefully before taking a swing at the ball. After three tries, I had done it! I had hit a hole-in-one.

I walked away feeling proud of myself for not getting frustrated when it had taken me longer than expected to finally get the job done. It taught me that patience is more than just a good trait to have - it is also incredibly rewarding.
