Dear Editor,

With the advent of the computer, our lives and our economy have been drastically changed. Computers have allowed us to stay connected in ways never before possible, and to access vast amounts of information and resources. However, I am of the opinion that the effects computers have had on people can often times be negative.

Studies have revealed that increased use of computers can affect the brain and cause cognitive issues such as memory problems, decreased attention span and difficulty in communication. Computers are not merely tools to aid in learning, but they can limit our interactions and hamper our social skills. Furthermore, reliance on computers can lead to a lack of problem-solving skills due to an inability to think outside the parameters of the computer.

I believe that computers are an important part of our lives, but that we must take steps to ensure that the usage of our devices is limited in order to prevent any detriment to oure social, physical and mental wellbeing. We must make deliberate choices in the way we use our computers, and prioritize meaningful human connection over increased screen time.

I urge the readers of this newspaper to consider the wide ranging affects computers can have on our lives, and to strive for a balanced lifestyle that incorporates healthy levels of technology usage.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
