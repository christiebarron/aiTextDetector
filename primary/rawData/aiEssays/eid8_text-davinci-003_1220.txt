I've been married to my wife for four years now, and one of the things that has always brought us together the most is our laughter. We can be having a terrible day and still find a way to make each other laugh.

One particular day, my wife was having an especially rough time at work. The stress of her job seemed to be getting to her. When she came home from work, I could tell that she was drained, her usual good spirits seemingly gone.

I immediately knew that I had to do something to snap her out of it. So I got up and tried out a few silly dance moves that I had learned a few days earlier. I figured if I couldn't make her laugh, nothing would!

Much to my surprise, it worked! Within minutes, my wife started to laugh and her mood seemed to improve drastically. We proceeded to dance around the kitchen, each of us trying to come up with even sillier moves than the other. We laughed so hard that tears were streaming down our faces.

That night, we both fell into bed exhausted but happy. The laughter had done its job in bringing us closer together and refilling us with joy.
