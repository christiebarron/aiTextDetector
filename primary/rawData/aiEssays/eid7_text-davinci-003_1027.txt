I recently had an experience where I was able to experience the benefits of being patient. It happened when I was waiting in line at the DMV. As I stood there, I noticed that the line was long, and stretching further than what I had expected it to be. I also noticed that the person at the counter was going through each process in a very meticulous manner, so I knew that I would be in for a long wait. 

Despite feeling frustrated, I decided to stay patient. I reminded myself that we all make mistakes every now and then, and that it was best to be as understanding as could be. I also kept myself occupied by talking to some of the people around me, and observing the different kinds of attitudes around me.

After a while, I was finally next in line and I was pleased when the person at the counter was just as patient with me. Despite some of the issues I faced, I was able to respond in a composed and even-tempered manner. 

In the end, I had the opportunity to not only take care of my business, but also to experience the power of patience and understanding. It was a valuable lesson, and I hope to not only practice this same kind of patience in the future.
