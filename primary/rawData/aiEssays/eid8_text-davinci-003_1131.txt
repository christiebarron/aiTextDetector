When I think of laughter, I always remember my first date with my now husband. We had been chatting for a few weeks, but this was our first time seeing each other in person. We had arranged to have lunch together at a little cafe, and as soon as I greeted him, I noticed he seemed a little tense. He wasn't quite sure how to act, so I decided to lighten the atmosphere by telling an off-color joke. I had no idea if he would think it was funny or not, but thankfully he started to chuckle and soon we were both laughing. We kept up the banter throughout the meal, and by the end of it, I felt as if we had known each other for a lifetime. That laughter helped to break down any walls that had existed between us and made us much closer. Eventually, that laughter grew into love and we decided to spend the rest of our lives together.
