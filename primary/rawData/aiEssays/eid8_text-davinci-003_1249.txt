One day, my best friend and I had finished a really hard exam and were feeling really anxious about the grade we were going to get. We were walking back home, just trying to cope with the sadness of not knowing our results yet. Suddenly, out of nowhere, we both began to laugh uncontrollably. We weren't even sure what had caused this burst of laughter, but it seemed to release all our stress from the exam. 

We were still laughing as we walked the street, until eventually we both began to gasp for air. As we collapsed to the ground, I looked over and saw my best friend bright eyed and smiling. The amount of joy this moment had brought to us was overwhelming, and that was when I knew that no matter what the exam results would bring â€“ we'd always have our laughter to get us through.
