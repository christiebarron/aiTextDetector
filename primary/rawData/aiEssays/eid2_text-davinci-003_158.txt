Censorship in libraries has become a controversial topic as of late and it warrants careful consideration. The arguments for and against these practices should be thoroughly discussed and evaluated before any decisions are made. 

We are living in a complicated world where information on any subject is readily available. Thus, it is the responsibility of libraries to ensure they are providing their patrons with the best materials possible. But how do we determine what is best? 

The right to free expression is fundamental to a free society and it applies to the library just as it does to every other place in our country. With that said, it must be acknowledged that some materials are offensive and should be removed from the shelves. It is up to librarians and library boards to decide which materials violate accepted community standards and should be removed. 

At the same time however, it is important to understand the great importance of allowing full access to everything on the shelves of our libraries. Libraries are an information resource for all people and to impose censorship is to show bias and deny them the right to research a broad range of topics and make their own decisions. It is also important to note that censoring material can open the door to further censorship, which can even lead to a complete denial of all information sources.

In conclusion, censorship in libraries can be a difficult subject to tackle. While offensive materials should be removed from the shelves, it is equally important to ensure the full access to the vast amount of materials available. It is our responsibility to safeguard the right to free expression and make sure that the library remains an open and unbiased source of information.
