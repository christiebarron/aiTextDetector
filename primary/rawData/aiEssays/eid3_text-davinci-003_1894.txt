The setting in Joe Kurmaski's short story, "Rough Road Ahead," is a major contributing factor to the cyclist's experience. From the wetlands that the cyclist has to cross, to the steep inclines, the environment has a direct effect on the cyclist's journey.

The wetlands present an obstacle for the cyclist, with tall grass and murky water hindering his progress. The cyclist has to maintain his balance and precise control of the bike to make it successfully through the wetland area. The cyclist quickly learns that the wetland terrain is even more difficult to cross in the rain, as he becomes increasingly unable to gain traction on the wet road.
