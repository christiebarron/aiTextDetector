In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the setting has a major impact on the cyclist. Kurmaski describes a dangerous and wild terrain, full of ruggedly steep cliffs and winding paths that climb high into the sky. This is far from the flat, open roads of the cyclist's hometown, and it presents him with a unique set of challenges. 

The steep grade of the path forces the cyclist to expend immense amounts of energy as he work to climb it. His heavy breathing is evidence of the difficulty he faces in trying to make it to the top. The tall cliffs on either side of him create a sense of enclosure and heighten his fear. With a long fall on either side of him, the cyclist is constantly aware of how dangerous the situation could become if he fails to pay attention.

The uneven and unpredictable nature of the roads also presents its own challenges. It's difficult for the cyclist to maneuver around the stones and rocks, and the winding curves force him to pay attention to his movements so he doesn't inadvertently go tumbling down the hill. All of these obstacles are further compounded by the lack of light and the deep shadows, making it more difficult to see the hazards and tricky curves
