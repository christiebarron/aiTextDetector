I remember a time when I exhibited patience. It was on a recent road trip I had with my family. With three smaller kids, a long car ride could potentially be a massive source of frustration for any parent. But, as my children bickered in the backseat and seemingly wouldn't let up, I was determined to stay afloat and enjoy our trip.

I understood that being cooped up in the car for hours on end could take its toll, so I tried my best to remain calm, patient, and understanding while they grumbled and fought. I intervene when necessary, but the majority of the time I simply reminded myself that they were just being kids and having fun.

I found myself to relax and laugh in spite of their antics. By staying patient and taking a step back, I was able to keep the peace and enjoy the ride while they continued to have fun.

I think this experience is teaching me, as a parent, to stay patient in the face of difficulty - something I'll carry with me for a long time.
