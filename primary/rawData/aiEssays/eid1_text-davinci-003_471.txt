Dear Editor,

In today's world, computers have become ubiquitous. We use them to work, to shop, to socialize, and to be entertained. While it may seem they are having a positive effect, I believe there are many drawbacks computers have had on people that should be taken into consideration.

It is clear that the convenience computers have provided have made everyday tasks easier. However, it has been proven that constant exposure to screens affects our mental and physical health. The blue light of our monitors can interfere with our sleep patterns, the radiation can disrupt digestion, and the excessive use can lead to social isolation or addiction.

Furthermore, computers can be a security risk. The same technologies that make our lives easier could be used to erase our data or steal our identities. The risk of malware, viruses, and hackers is increasing every day, and that makes it very hard for people to protect their data.

I hope this letter serves as a reminder to consider the potential problems that computers can bring to your life. While they can be incredibly helpful, itâ€™s important to take precautions to protect yourself from the risks that come along with them.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
