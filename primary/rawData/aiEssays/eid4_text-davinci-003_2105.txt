Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” is a poem that depicts the hard work of a Chinese girl in the United States, whose family is living in poverty. The poem’s climax comes in its ending line: “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?” The symbolism of the line is simple yet powerful. The line speaks of hope, of being able to regain one’s strength after a period of difficulty and struggle. 

The winter hibiscus in the poem is a metaphor for the speaker’s struggle. Despite the snow that is burying it and the cold that is blanketing it, the hibiscus persists and stands tall. This informs the readers that, despite all odds and challenges, the speaker is determined and resilient in her pursuit of a better life. She knows that no matter what, when the spring comes, it will be the time to renew her strength and continue her studies. The geese’s return is also a reminder that no matter what life throws at her, the speaker still holds hope in her heart and is not ready to give up.

The line speaks of perseverance, resilience, and hope. In it, one can also find a beautiful contrast between winter and spring. While winter is a time of darkness, coldness, and struggle, spring symbolizes new beginnings, growth, and hope.
