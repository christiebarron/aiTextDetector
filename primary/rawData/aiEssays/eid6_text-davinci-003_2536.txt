The construction of the Empire State Building of New York City provided a number of unique challenges for the builders, as they worked to enable the docking of dirigibles at the top of the building. The formidable task of creating a mooring mast suited to accommodating these massive and unpredictable airships was successfully completed with the building's opening in 1931.

The design of the new mooring mast was fraught with obstacles, as it had to be both structurally sound and light enough for the airships to lift it into the air. The buildingâ€™s initial plans called for a steel mast, but such a design would have been far too heavy to be lifted by the airships, so a lighter alternative had to be created. To answer this challenge, the builders opted to incorporate a hollow steel mast, running the length of the building and filled with sand to add stability. This approach allowed the mast to be light enough that it could be pulled upwards without overburdening the airships.

At the very top of the building, a durable platform was also needed to ensure that the airships could safely land upon it. To accomplish this, the builders made use of an innovative technique, utilizing thick plates of steel that were welded together and reinforced with crossbars. This platform could withstand the weight of a fully-laden airship and the force of strong wind gusts.

The final challenge of the construction process was ensuring that the mooring mast, platform and the building itself could properly interact with the airships. To accomplish this, the builders included a powerful electric motor at the top of the mast
