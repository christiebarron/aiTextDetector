The Empire State Building is an iconic building that was designed to be docked by dirigibles, but its creators faced many obstacles in pursuing this dream. The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, details the stories of the inventors, engineers, and pilots that worked on the project.

The first hurdle builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome was the design of the building itself. The height and shape of the building were not well suited for docking dirigibles since dirigibles typically require a large flat area to attached their mooring lines. To address this, designers proposed using a mooring mast, a steel tower located at the top of the Empire State Building that could secure a probe from an airship’s rope. The mooring mast was a complex structure, with many smaller elements that had to be designed, tested, and approved. It took months of work to complete the planning and construction of the mooring mast.

In addition to the design of the mooring mast, the builders had to acquire a special permit to allow dirigibles to dock. Federal aviation regulations prohibited docking of airships at any higher than 500 feet and the Empire State Building stood at 1,500 feet high. The engineers addressed this issue by including a “no-fly” zone that was marked around the base of the Empire State Building and extending up to three hundred feet from the top of the building. The team also installed a directed lighthouse beam under the building, allowing pilots to safely approach for docking even in the darkness.
