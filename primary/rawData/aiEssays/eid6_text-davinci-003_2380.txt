The Empire State Building is a remarkable feat of human engineering, but its original purpose was to provide the world with a safe and reliable docking system for transatlantic dirigibles. This was a monumental task, and it faced numerous obstacles. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, these challenges are presented and explored.

The first obstacle encountered when constructing the mooring mast was the practicality of the building’s design. The site selected for the building was too close to the city for dirigibles to fly directly overhead and moor. Additionally, the existing buildings nearby presented their own safety hazard. In order to safely dock a dirigible, the structure had to be built 72 floors up, and even at that height, the mooring mast still needed to be carefully calculated and constructed in order to prevent the building from toppling over. Furthermore, in order for the mooring ropes to be effective, the height of the mast had to be adjusted each time a new dirigible approached. All of these considerations had to be taken into account when constructing the mooring mast.

The second obstacle was the challenge inherent in bringing a heavy dirigible to dock safely. The sheer weight of the airship could cause an overhaul in the Empire State Building and the potential destruction of the mooring mast. Thus, special precautions had to be taken, from special mooring cables and ropes to special landing systems to help reduce the strain on the building. Additionally, all passengers, crew, and cargo had to be removed from the vehicle and placed onto the building
