As a library patron, I am writing to express my strong opinion on the subject of censorship in libraries. While I understand the desire of library administrators and governing bodies to shield the public from offensive materials, I believe that the censorship of these materials from library shelves goes beyond necessity and suppresses access to valuable and informative knowledge. 

It is of extreme importance for libraries to promote open access to all types of materials - including those deemed to be indecent or otherwise "offensive". Books, music, movies and magazines are all integral parts of our collective knowledge system and cultural heritage. To remove these materials from the shelves of libraries not only limits the diversity of ideas that people can explore, but actively restricts citizens from freely interacting with a variety of informative sources.

Furthermore, censorship in libraries disregards the basic civil and human rights of individuals to seek out the information they are interested in. Censorship prevents citizens from understanding the complexity and nuances of various beliefs and viewpoints and prevents them from developing critical thinking skills on controversial topics. The implementation of censorship guidelines would also leave the door open to subjective evaluations on the acceptability of different materials, which could only serve to further impede the exploration of knowledge. 

In conclusion, I believe that the censorship of books, music, movies and magazines in libraries is a form of discrimination that is beyond justified. By providing society with unrestricted access to all forms of information, libraries can allow for the unbiased celebration of knowledge and its invaluable benefits.
