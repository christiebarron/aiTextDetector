I vividly remember the day my kid sister came home with a failing grade in history. She was an average student, but this time she came home in tears. I knew she was disappointed, but my mom was also really mad. She immediately asked her not-so-patiently what she did wrong. My sister burst into tears and didn't give us a clear answer.

I put my hand on her shoulder and said, "It's ok, we'll figure this out together." Taking a deep breath, I spoke to my mom calmly, explaining that my sister was obviously very upset, and it would be better to discuss this when she was ready. 

My mom took a couple steps back and listened to me. She ultimately agreed with me that this was not the time for a heated discussion. Even though my mom was frustrated, she took a deep breath and was patient with us.

My sister was grateful that I stood up for her. We all had a chance to cool off, and when the time was right, we had a productive talk. In the end, my sister was able to make up the grade. I'm glad that in that moment we were all patient with each other. Being patient doesn't always come easy, but it definitely pays off in the end.
