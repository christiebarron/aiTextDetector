I recently encountered a situation in which being patient was the best solution. I had asked my cousin if she could drive me to the store and she said yes. On the day of our scheduled trip, she was running late. I felt my frustration and annoyance rising, but instead of lashing out I decided to remain patient. I reminded myself that she had agreed to help me and that it was important to stay calm.

I checked my phone multiple times but still no call or text from her. I waited and waited until finally after what felt like ages, she texted me back apologising profusely and said she had been held up in traffic.

Instead of getting angry, I replied telling her that it was alright and not to worry. I was relieved when I finally saw her pull up and we hopped in the car. I was glad for the exercise in patience - it felt like it was the right thing to do and I was thankful that I had resisted the temptation to overreact.
