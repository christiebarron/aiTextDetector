Dear Editor,

As a citizen of [your town], I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Many people have mixed opinions on the use of computers and their potential impact on our daily lives. I believe that computer technology has the power to drastically improve our lives, if used correctly.

For starters, computers make it much easier to communicate with people around the world. With the click of a mouse, you can send emails to distant relatives or look up interesting facts on the internet. Most people would be lost in the maze of paper, stamps and envelopes used in the days before computers. Computers also help us organize our lives, enabling us to remember tasks and deadlines that would previously have been forgotten.

Furthermore, computers allow us to work faster and with more efficiency. Assignments that would have taken hours of tedious calculations can now be completed in a fraction of the time. This provides us with more free time, which can be used for more leisure activities. In addition, computers can provide invaluable resources to students who are researching for themselves or doing schoolwork.

The only negative side of computers, in my opinion, is when people become addicted to the world of computers and the internet. Unfortunately, this can lead to problems such as social isolation. However, this issue can be avoided if computer use is balanced with other activities and real-world relationships.

Overall, I believe that computers offer us many benefits and
