The setting of Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski has a significant impact on the cyclist's experience. The cyclist is going on a recreational ride and the setting highlights the challenges he faces. In particular, the geography of the area is written in such a way that the cyclist is continually facing difficult terrain and inclement weather.

The cyclist is continually presented with short, steep hills which he must ascend in order to move forward. The constant ups and downs are tiring and frustrate the cyclist, who must expend a great amount of energy just to make it through each hill. The weather also works against the cyclist, providing him with cooler temperatures, rain, wind, and even fog at times. This makes it harder for the cyclist to complete his ride and can potentially cause him to suffer from the elements.

Altogether, the setting of Rough Road Ahead acts as a major challenge for the cyclist. He must use his physical and mental strength to push himself and encounter the difficulties of the hills, the weather, and the fatigue that results from both. The environment also serves as a metaphor, representing the struggles of life and the importance of perseverance despite obstacles. The cyclist's journey, despite being difficult, is necessary and rewarding
