I remember back to when me and my girlfriend started dating. We had so much in common, like our love of ice cream, funny movies, and travel. But what really brought us together was our mutual ability to laugh. 

We were out on one of our first dates, just innocently grabbing coffee. Neither of us could think of anything to say and we were both getting a little bit uncomfortable. That’s when one of us, to this day I still don't know who, started snorting with laughter. We just kept on going, snorting and giggling at each other until we burst out laughing.

It was a silly thing, and it was a great ice breaker. From that moment on we just kept on laughing together. Every time we were around each other we'd find something to crack a joke about and just enjoy the moment. We found that no matter how much time had passed, when we were together we always had the same connection, and it was always based in laughter. 

Now, four years later, we’re still together and one of the main things that keeps our relationship strong is laughter. Whether it’s just silly jokes or us remembering our first date, laughter brings us closer together.
