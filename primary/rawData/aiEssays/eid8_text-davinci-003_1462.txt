I was on my way to meet a good friend of mine who I hadn't seen in a while. The drive was long and I started to get anxious. I started to worry that I wouldn't be able to interact with my friend in a meaningful way, that I would run out of something to say, that we had grown too far apart. All of these worries raced through my mind as I pulled up to their house.

My worries quickly dissipated when my friend opened the door, greeted me with a big hug, and after a few moments, started to laugh. We hadnâ€™t seen each other in quite some time, but it was as if no time had passed at all. We laughed about all the silly things we used to do, from getting in trouble to just plain goofing off. We laughed about the current happenings in our lives, from silly mistakes to instances of pure joy. 

It was amazing to feel that instantaneous connection, for us to both be so comfortable with each other that we could laugh at the same time, even if it was different things. Afterwards, we were finally able to fill the gaps of our conversations, to chat about the meaningful things that had happened since we last saw each other. 

But it was the laughter that brought us together, that reminded us of the connection and bond between us, and that will forever stay imprinted in my mind.
