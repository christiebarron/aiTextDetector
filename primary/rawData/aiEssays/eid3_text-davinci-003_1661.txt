In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the central character is symbolically represented by a cyclist. The cyclist’s internal journey is closely connected to the physical environment encountered on the bicycle path. The setting – of a rugged, winding road surrounded by nature’s magnificence – serves to emphasize the challenging terrain the cyclist must traverse. The ruggedness of the road symbolically represents the difficult journey that the cyclist must undertake in order to achieve fulfillment.

The cyclist encounters a variety of physical features throughout his journey, these features have a direct impact on the physical and emotional experience of the cyclist. The mountains symbolically represent his challenges – the significant challenges and physical effort he must expend to progress. The ravines and rivers help to further emphasize the challenges of the day – the need to dip, slow and pause along the path. The rivers also provide a source of respite, helping to symbolise a space for reflection amidst the physical challenges of the route.

The presence of hills, and steeply climbing hills, heighten the sense of struggle, presenting the cyclist with an uphill battle like no other. The scenery is ever-changing, wondrous and breath-taking
