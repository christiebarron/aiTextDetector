In the modern world, libraries are often seen as a neutral zone, free of prejudice and opinion. Despite this perception, censorship is still commonly practiced in libraries, especially with regards to how particular materials are received and presented. While it may be seen as necessary to some, I strongly believe that it should be avoided at all costs.

Firstly, censorship significantly limits the free access of information to patrons. Certain topics may be stigmatized or deemed controversial, resulting in such material being withheld from the public. This blocks potential knowledge growth in the area and restricts patronsâ€™ access to a wide range of diverse views. Furthermore, libraries often censor materials which do not necessarily have to do with controversial or sensitive topics, such as material aimed at young adults. Restricting such material puts a limitation on the development of young minds and could even cause them to form distorted views on certain topics.

Secondly, censorship denies accustomed readers the opportunity to indulge in material that a library has provided them with for years. Patrons often find a certain comfort in familiar faces when it comes to their reading; censorship inhibits the ability of such readers to take pleasure in the same activities they have done for decades.

Censorship in libraries of any kind should be severely limited, except in the case of extreme scenarios. They should provide ample access to important and relevant materials that can help fuel the intellectual and cultural awareness of their patrons. They are the ideal spot to explore a vast variety of views and perspectives, which is why it is so important to ensure that censorship is kept to an absolute minimum in order to keep these spaces open and free.
