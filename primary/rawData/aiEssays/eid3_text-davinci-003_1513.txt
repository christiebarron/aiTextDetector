The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski heavily affects the cyclist's experience. The cyclist is riding in a mountain pass, and this environment is crucial for the story. The steep, rigorous terrain creates difficulty and danger, as the cyclist is unable to accelerate on the inclines and must take cautious steps on the downhill. The environment also provides a sense of isolation, as the cyclist is surrounded by vast space and only nature is present. 

The elements of the environment are a hazard, as the terrain is rough and the wind is strong. Taking on the incline creates a physical strain and exhaustion which is amplified by the cold, fog, and wind. This challenge creates an adrenaline rush to the cyclist, which increases their drive to reach the summit. The air is thin due to the altitude, which adds to the difficulty.

The various obstacles that come with the setting also adds to the story's suspense. The cyclist must constantly watch for loose rocks and other obstacles that may cause them to crash, as well as balancing their speed to prevent a crash. The cyclist is also battling with their own fears and insecurities, intensifying the struggle.
