I recently had the pleasure of meeting an elderly woman who showed the highest level of patience and understanding. She was elderly and lived with her son, who was disabled. He had difficulty communicating and could become quite frustrated. 

One day, I had visited her home and he became quite angry, frustrated, and confused. Despite this, the woman remained incredibly understanding and patient. She comforted him, spoke gently, and reassured him that everything would be alright. 

These actions had a calming effect and, soon, he was back to his normal bouncing self. Knowing how hard it must have been for the woman to remain so calm, I was speechless. Her patience and understanding was an inspiration for us all.
