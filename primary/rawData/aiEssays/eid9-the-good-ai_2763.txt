The Chinese New Year ’s Eve In My Family
Growing up in a Chinese family, the Chinese New Year’s Eve was always a special occasion for me. It was a time when my family would come together to celebrate the start of a new year and to honor our traditions and customs. The memories of those celebrations are still vivid in my mind, and they hold a special place in my heart.
The preparations for the Chinese New Year’s Eve would begin weeks before the actual day. My mother would clean every corner of our house, from top to bottom, to get rid of any bad luck from the previous year. She believed that it was important to start the new year with a clean slate. My siblings and I were tasked with helping her with this massive cleaning project, which we did begrudgingly.
As the day drew closer, my mother would start cooking up a storm in our kitchen. She would prepare all kinds of traditional Chinese dishes like dumplings, spring rolls, fish, and rice cakes. These dishes were not just delicious but also had symbolic meanings behind them. For example, dumplings symbolized wealth because they looked like ancient Chinese gold or silver ingots.
On the day itself, we would wake up early to help with more preparations. My father would go out to buy fresh flowers and fruits from the market while my siblings and I helped set up decorations around our home. We hung red lanterns outside our house as well as inside it because red is considered an auspicious color in Chinese culture.
In the evening, we all dressed up in new clothes – another tradition that symbolizes starting anew – and gathered around our dining table for dinner. The feast that my mother had prepared was nothing short of amazing; there were so many dishes that we could barely fit them all on the table! As we ate together as a family, we talked about what we hoped for in the coming year: good health, happiness, success at school or work.
After dinner, we would watch the annual Chinese New Year’s Eve Gala on television. This was a variety show that featured singers, dancers, acrobats, and comedians from all over China. It was a tradition that had been going on for decades and was watched by millions of people across the country. My family and I loved watching it because it was always so entertaining.
As midnight approached, we would light firecrackers outside our house to scare away evil spirits. The sound of firecrackers exploding filled the air, and we could hear them going off in other houses nearby too. It was a noisy but exciting time.
Once the firecrackers had died down, my parents would give us red envelopes filled with money – another tradition that symbolizes good luck and prosperity. We would thank them before heading off to bed exhausted but happy.
The Chinese New Year’s Eve celebrations were not just about having fun; they were also about honoring our traditions and customs. They reminded us of where we came from and what our ancestors had gone through to get us here today. They taught us to respect our culture and heritage while also embracing modernity.
Looking back now as an adult, I realize how important those celebrations were for me growing up. They helped shape my identity as a Chinese person living in a multicultural society. They gave me a sense of belonging and pride in my heritage.
As I write this essay, I am reminded of how much I miss those celebrations now that I live far away from my family in another country. But even though I can’t be there physically with them this year due to the pandemic restrictions, I will still celebrate the Chinese New Year’s Eve in my own way – by cooking some traditional dishes myself and watching the gala online.
In conclusion, the Chinese New Year’s Eve celebrations were an integral part of my childhood memories growing up in a Chinese family. They were more than just fun times; they were a way for us to connect with our culture and traditions. They taught me the importance of family, respect, and gratitude. And even though I am far away from my family now, those memories will always hold a special place in my heart.
