When I was in the fourth grade I got a new teacher. She was very strict and demanded a lot from her students. Every day we had a lot of work to do and if we didn't finish it all, we had to stay after school. I was very anxious because I feared getting into trouble and struggling on assignments. 

One day I got stuck on a math problem and couldn't figure out how to solve it. I was starting to feel frustrated and thought my teacher wouldn't help me. But I decided to stay patient and asked her for assistance. To my surprise she was very kind and encouraging. She explained the problem to me step by step and praised me for my effort. By being patient, I was able to understand the concept and succeed in the assignment. 

I'm glad I stayed patient because it taught me a valuable lesson. Even if a situation is difficult, being patient and understanding can help us get through tough challenges.
