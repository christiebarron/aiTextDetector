I had been dating my girlfriend for about a month when I decided to take her out on a picnic. As I was packing up the food, I joked, "I hope this doesn't turn out to be too romantic or else I'll have to go on my second date with you!" 

My girlfriend chuckled and said, "Oh, you think I'm that easy, huh?"

We sat down on the picnic blanket, and I opened the basket of snacks. She had never tried this particular kind before, so I asked her to try some. She popped a piece in her mouth and her eyes lit up, saying it was delicious. 

We both started laughing, as I said, "See, after all these years I'm still impressing you, huh?"

We continued to laugh and joke as we enjoyed our picnic. Later, when we got home, we ended the night with one more laugh - a silly, inside joke that will only ever belong to us. 

That day of laughter provided us with a special shared memory that will stay with me forever.
