My friend and I had been having a long and tiring day. We had met for lunch and had just finished our meal. We decided to take a walk to get some fresh air. 

We strolled along in silence, but something about the setting—the warm, golden afternoon light streaming through the trees and the chirping birds—made us both smile. 

Suddenly, my friend and I started to giggle. It was a silly little thing—we had both started to try and hum an old tune at the same time. 

We looked at each other and burst out laughing, and before I knew it, we were in a full-blown fit, almost doubled over with laughter. We were two strangers and we didn't even know each other, but there was something so intimate, so freeing, and so joyful that came from those few moments of shared laughter. 

As we made our way back, the laughter almost seemed to linger in the air. It was a reminder that sometimes, even two strangers can find a moment of joy through something as simple as laughter.
