The Empire State Building is an iconic tall structure in New York City, United States, and was the first building in the world to have more than 100 stories. When it was built, its designers had the ambitious goal of creating a building with a mooring mast at the top that would allow dirigibles, also known as airships, to dock. Although it seemed like a great idea at the time, there were numerous obstacles to the success of this undertaking.

The first obstacle was engineering design. A mooring mast would need to be sturdy enough both to withstand the force of an airship docking and to keep itself and the dirigible in place while the transfer of passengers and cargo occurred. This would require precision and testing, as the mooring mast would likely need to be several stories taller than the actual Empire State Building in order to accommodate the size and weight of the airships.

Second, the mooring mast would need to be designed and constructed with safety in mind. Considering the fragile nature of airships and the countless number of people visiting and working in the Empire State Building, the possibility of accidents and a potential for considerable harm or death was too high.

Additionally, the lack of available materials and technology in the early twentieth century posed another obstacle. At that time, few organizations in the United States had the resources, expertise, and experience with dirigibles as well as actual flight experience to design and create a suitable mooring mast. This shortage of material and technology would only be compounded by the difficulty of bringing them to the top of the Empire State Building in order to
