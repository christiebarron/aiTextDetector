I had been feeling really down lately and was feeling completely disconnected from my friends and my partner. I just felt so disconnected from everyone and I just could not seem to get out of this funk I was in.

One day, I was out with a group of my friends. We decided to rent a double decker bus and drive around the city, exploring all the different sights. Towards the end of the night, we stopped at a park and decided to play a game of soccer.

I remember feeling so relaxed and just feeling these waves of happiness wash over me. I didnâ€™t feel like myself for the first time in a long time. Beside me was my partner, who was laughing hysterically at the goofy things some of the others were doing on the field.

Suddenly, I felt the urge to join him and started laughing hysterically myself. We just kept laughing and laughing and before long, I was laughing so hard that I was doubled over and tears were streaming down my face.

My friends and my partner, they all looked at me with surprise and then they started to laugh as well. It felt so good to be laughing with them, all of us in sync with each other. It was like all of the stress and pain of the past week had been lifted off my shoulders.

It felt like coming home and when it was finally time for us to leave, I felt more connected to my partner and to my friends than I had ever been before. That night, laughter created a new bond between us and it felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.
