The Empire State Building presented an important opportunity for those seeking to build aircraft of all kinds, including dirigibles, in the 1920s and 1930s. Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's The Mooring Mast details the ambitious plans to build a mast on top of the world-famous skyscraper that would serve as a port for dirigibles. While the plans for the building were underway, many challenges arose for the builders in order for the mooring mast to be successful.

First and foremost, the task of constructing a mooring mast on top of the world's tallest building was a daunting one. The magnitude of the project, combined with the high-altitude winds and the limited space on top of the building, posed an immense risk to the builders. Moreover, it was unclear if the lifts and anchor points necessary for the docking process could actually be constructed and function properly. Additionally, strong winds at that elevation could toss the dirigibles around if the mooring mast design was not robust enough.

Furthermore, the idea of using the roof of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles was met with strong opposition. Many argued that it was unnecessary and hazardous, as the introduction of flammable dirigibles would create an extreme risk of fire on top of the building. Additionally, those who hoped to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building faced opposition from the government due to the fact that the airships could easily become a target of enemy attack.

However, despite all the obstacles, the Empire State Building builders eventually managed to construct the mooring mast that served
