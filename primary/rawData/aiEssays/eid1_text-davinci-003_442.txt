Dear Editor,
 
We’re all now extremely familiar with the presence of computers in our lives, but it’s still worth considering their effects on our minds and on our social lives. I believe that using computers can be beneficial and can have a positive effect on us as people. 

First of all, computers can open up a world of knowledge and information that would otherwise have been unavailable to us. By providing us access to an infinite library of books, movies, and conversations, computers allow us to learn more and broaden our cultural and intellectual experiences. Computers also enable us to connect with people and places in ways we could never have achieved before. 

Furthermore, computers can help us work more efficiently. Whether it’s for class assignments or a professional task such as managing finances, the automation of tasks and the organization of data provided by computers can be incredibly helpful. This applies to career tasks and home life as well. 

I understand the criticism of computers resulting in a decrease in face-to-face human contact, and it’s definitely something to watch out for. But in a social media era, people can be just as connected online as they can in person. Keeping a balance between personal contact and technology is important, but I don't think computers are always the enemy in this arena. 

Though computers have their negatives, utilizing them responsibly can have a huge positive impact on our lives. I encourage
