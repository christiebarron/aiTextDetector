The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski deeply affects the cyclist. The setting is a desolate and winding road, lined with terrible potholes and deep mud. The cyclist feels extremely vulnerable and exposed in this barren landscape. The strong winds also contribute to their peril as they battle every gust in order to stay upright. The deep mud also proves challenging to maneuver, as the cyclist attempts to steer their way through it. 

The lack of safety on the road risks both physical and mental strain on the cyclist. The cyclist is vulnerable to possible danger as they navigate this treacherous route. The environment also puts psychological strain on the cyclist, due to the open and seemingly never-ending landscape. This sense of isolation and lack of familiarity with the surrounding area draws feelings of insecurity. 

The distinct features of this setting also affect the cyclist in a more positive way, however. The athleteâ€™s physical condition improves through the struggle and challenge the road provides, requiring the cyclist to use their strength and skill in order to make it through successfully. The intense wind, practice in navigating through the mud, and the strain of pushing their bike is not only great exercise, but also teaches the cyclist to be resilient
