I was at an airport recently and the flight I was meant to take was heavily delayed. Initially I was frustrated, as the delay was a few hours and would mean that I'd miss the event I was meant to get to. As I waited at the airport I noticed that many of the people around me were getting increasingly agitated and angry, resulting in a lot of arguing with both the airline workers and one another.

I decided to take a different approach and remain patient, understanding that these things can happen, and that sometimes things are beyond our control. I kept my head down and tried my best to remain calm and not get caught up in the drama around me. 

After what felt like forever, we were eventually given the okay to board the plane, and I was pretty relieved. After everything was sorted I found out that the delay wasn't actually the airline's fault, so they were doing the best they could to help us. 

The experience taught me an important lesson in the value of patience, and I'm glad I chose to remain patient rather than getting angry with the situation.
