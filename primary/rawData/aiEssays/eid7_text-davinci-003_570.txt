I was recently at the grocery store when I encountered a very long line-up at the checkout. It seemed like everyone had done their shop just before the store was about to close. I felt a little bit frustrated and wanted to leave, but I decided to be patient and wait it out. 

I was in line for over 20 minutes and there were still around 10 people in front of me. As I waited, I started to observe the other customers around me. One person had a huge cart and there were two others who were arguing about the bill. As the line moved slowly, I could feel my patience slipping away, but I kept reminding myself to stay calm.

Finally, it was my turn at the checkout. As the cashier was scanning my items, he stopped for a few minutes to go look for something in the backroom. I could feel my frustration rising, but I took a few deep breaths and told myself to remain patient. After a few more minutes he came back and finished scanning my items. Even though it had been a very long wait, I thanked the cashier and rewarded myself with a treat for being patient. 

In the end, it was worth the wait. I was proud of myself for not getting frustrated or saying anything unkind to the cashier. Being patient proved to be rewarding, because I was able to stay cool and get through my shopping trip in a calm and collected manner.
