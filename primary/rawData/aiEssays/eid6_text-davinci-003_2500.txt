The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. This included concerns about the strength of the mast, the design of the mooring platform, and the winds that could potentially be created by heavy traffic.

The first challenge was to design a strong enough mast to support the weight of a docked dirigible. The mast would need to be strong enough to withstand the heavy gales created by the airship and have a large enough size and shape to accommodate a large enough section of the airship. After lengthy tests, it was decided that the existing spire of the Empire State Building could be modified for the purpose, and that it would be a suitable size and strength to support a dirigible.

The second challenge was designing a suitable mooring platform at the top of the new mast. It needed to provide a stable and secure platform on which the airship could rest while docked. The high winds and possibility of strong gusts meant that the platform needed to be capable of withstanding extreme weather conditions. After much trial and error, it was decided that a set of strong cables and winches would provide the right amount of support.

The third challenge was predicting and managing the winds that could be created by the presence of dirigibles at the top of the mast. The winds created by an airship are much stronger than those created by passing aircraft and can cause serious damage to the building. To ensure that the mast could withstand these winds, it was necessary to measure them beforehand and create a set of regulations for dirigible
