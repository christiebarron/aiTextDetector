In Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a key role in affecting the cyclist as they journey through a rugged, terrain-filled landscape. The cyclist is presented to us as a brave, determined individual, and they must rely on both their own strength and the features of the terrain in order to reach the top of the hill. 

The first feature of the setting to affect the cyclist is the terrain itself. The craggy, rough, and winding cliff paths challenge the cyclist and make the ascent up the mountain more difficult than it would be on a flat road. The cyclist faces many obstacles along the way, including steep slopes, rocks, and slippery surfaces. The rugged terrain demands the cyclist to use their energy and concentration to the fullest extent. 

The second feature of the setting to affect the cyclist is the weather. The dry and dusty atmosphere forces the cyclist to labor under hot and dry conditions. The cyclist must remain alert and aware of their surroundings, as the sun can become a detriment to their focus and their energy. The weather also acts a motivator, as the heat and humidity encourage the cyclist to push themselves to the limit and finish the ride successfully.
