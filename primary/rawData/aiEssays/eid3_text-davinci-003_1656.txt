In the short story, ‘Rough Road Ahead’, by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays a big part in defining the obstacles a cyclist must overcome. Just by the title alone, the reader can infer that the road ahead will be full of unforeseen challenges. 

The rough terrain of the road and the surrounding landscape is the first obstacle that must be faced. This is not just physical, but also psychological, as there is the fear of the unknown. Long dirt trails without guardrails and unexpected twists in the road can be overwhelming, but they must be taken on in order to reach one's goals.

The landscape is also full of distractions, making it hard for the cyclist to focus. There are wildflowers for miles, which can be beautiful and pleasant, but also beg for attention. The sun is often harsh, causing fatigue and dehydration. Weather can also be a factor, with unexpected storms and high temperatures making it harder to stay concentrated.

The morale can also take a hit, as the cyclist can become overwhelmed and lonely without the company of other riders. Even when they do come across other riders, they can still feel isolated thinking they are beyond their league.
