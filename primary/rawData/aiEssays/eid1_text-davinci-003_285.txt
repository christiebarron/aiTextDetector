Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to recent discussion surrounding the effects of computers on people. I believe computers can have both positive and negative effects on people when used thoughtfully.

On the positive side, computers give people access to a vast amount of knowledge. Researching a topic, learning a new skill, or finding solutions to problems can now be done much faster and more efficiently. People can also connect with family, friends and colleagues from around the world thanks to the benefit of the internet. Itâ€™s easier to stay in touch with our loved ones and even make new friends.

However, computers can also have a negative impact if not used in moderation. People may spend too much time on the computer and lose track of time, as well as social contact. They can become addicted to the internet or video games and neglect important activities in real life. They can become so involved in the virtual world that they forget about themselves and their responsibilities.

Therefore, computers should be used responsibly and in moderation. It is important that people balance their online activities with other hobbies and spend only a certain amount of time in front of the computer or phone. Computers can be extremely beneficial and bring us great joy and information, so if used wisely, they can bring positive outcomes.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
