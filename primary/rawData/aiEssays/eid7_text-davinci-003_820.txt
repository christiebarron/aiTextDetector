I recently had the opportunity to witness remarkable patience in my grandmother. She had recently had surgery and was on a long road to recovery. During this time, she had to endure multiple doctor's appointments, physical therapy, and a strict diet. She became frustrated and wanted to get back to her old self--doing the hobbies she enjoys and being independent.

Still, despite all of these potential setbacks, my grandmother kept her composure and her faith. She went through each doctor's appointment with a positive attitude, wrote down her medical instructions, and did her best to adhere to her new diet.

On more than one occasion, she could have lost her patience, yet she remained calm and collected. She did all she could to ensure a speedy recovery, but she was also appreciative of her limitations.

My grandmotherâ€™s patience and understanding was truly inspiring. Every day, I am reminded to take it slowly and accept whatever life throws my way gracefully. For that, I'm very grateful.
