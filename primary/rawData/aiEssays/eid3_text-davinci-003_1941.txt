The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s story “Rough Road Ahead” is a key component of the plot, providing insight into both the protagonist’s mindset and the consequences of his life choices. The setting of this story is a deserted road through a sparsely populated land, and its details depict a difficult journey ahead.

In this stark environment, the cyclist travels down a steep and winding road that roams through an area pockmarked with bumps and potholes. For the reader, this is an indication that the cyclist is headed towards a difficult climb, made more difficult by the fact that he is alone and relatively unprotected from the elements. Additionally, the area is described as “bleak and barren,” suggesting loneliness and a lack of support, a fact further driven home by the lack of signposts or people to offer a helping hand.

The protagonist must now grapple with the reality of his difficult situation. Not only must he physically endure the challenging journey, he must also come to terms with the consequences of his choices, including the possibility of failure and being stuck in an unknown landscape.
