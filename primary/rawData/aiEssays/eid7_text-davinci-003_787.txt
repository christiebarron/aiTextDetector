I remember once going to the doctor's office for a routine checkup. I was already running late for my appointment and, when I arrived, the clinic was full of people waiting to be seen. I expected I'd be waiting for a while before being seen and was prepared to wait it out.

But, just then, the doctor's receptionist announced that the doctor that day was running behind and it would be at least an hour before they could accommodate everyone. I expected everyone to groan and become frustrated, but to my surprise, everyone remained calm and quiet.

Some people got out of line and offered their spot so that others, like elderly patients, wouldn't have to wait as long. Others stayed in their spot, peacefully reading books or quietly conversing with one another.

I was amazed by the patient behavior of the people in the clinic and couldn't help but admire everyone. In the end, everyone waited the full hour until they were seen and everyone was very polite to one another from start to finish, even despite the inconvenience. It was a refreshing reminder that we are all in this together and should treat each other with kindness and patience.
