In his memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood that is nostalgic, introspective, and hopeful all at once. Through the lens of his personal experiences, Rodriguez reflects on his journey as a designer and his vibrant Latino heritage. “Home for me has always been about movement” Rodriguez writes, and his memoir does the same - Rodriguez allows readers to observe how his childhood in Newark, New Jersey shaped his aspirations, drove his pursuits of the fashion industry, and inspired his diverse collections.

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez transports the reader into his world by illustrating the sounds of his youth - from the sizzling rhythm of traditional salsa music, which “spoke of romance, of a sort of longing for something just out of reach”, to the pungent smells of his grandmother’s dishes. He also sheds light on his own innermost thoughts, revealing his doubts and fears, as well as his immense passion. These expressions create an intimate, honest dialogue between Rodriguez and his readers.

At the core of the memoir runs a strong thread of reverence and hope. In describing the home of his youth, Rodriguez focuses not on the hardship, but rather on the tenderness that surrounded him. This sentiment of resilience and love is what ultimately permeates the memoir and its tone. By the end of it, readers are left with a sense of admiration, and of the potential within us all to carry with us “the pieces of home” no matter where the wind takes us.
