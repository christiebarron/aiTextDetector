I will never forget the moment I heard my best friend laugh uncontrollably for the first time. We had been friends since grade school and I thought I knew him pretty well, but had never heard him laugh that way.

This particular day was especially dreary and it seemed our spirits were both low. We had been stuck inside all day due to the weather and in an effort to get us out of our slump I had decided to play a prank on him. I pulled out my old water gun and aimed it at him. He didn't know what to do and instead of yelling at me or running away, he just stared. I slowly moved the gun closer and gestured at him with a jokingly threatening expression, hoping he would smile. But every time I moved closer, he reacted as if he were scared, so I eventually backed off.

That's when it happened. He thought the situation was so ridiculous that he let out this loud and boisterous laughter, the kind you only get when you suddenly realize the situation you’re in is silly and you can’t help but succumb to the laughter. His laughter made me laugh, and before I knew it, we were falling over with laughter, our spirits renewed.

I still remember how amazing it felt, watching my best friend laugh with me in that moment and knowing that I had helped to make our day a happy one after all.
