When I was in middle school, I had a friend who was always late for assignments and classes. Our teacher had warned him multiple times about punctuality, but he never seemed to listen. Every time I saw him running into the classroom, I felt a combination of embarrassment and frustration.

Despite feeling this way, I was patient with him. I tried to help him by setting reminders and giving him a wake-up call. I wanted to scold him for his irresponsibility, but I knew it wouldn’t do any good.

So instead, I was understanding and patient. I was supportive and tried to encourage him to be more organized. He had a lot of potential, and I didn’t want him to get in trouble just because of being late.

I'm glad to say it worked. With my help, my friend was able to turn things around. He became a lot more punctual and his grades improved significantly.

This experience taught me the power of patience. Not all problems can be solved by scolding or force. Sometimes, it’s important to show patience and understanding in order to help people realize their potential.
