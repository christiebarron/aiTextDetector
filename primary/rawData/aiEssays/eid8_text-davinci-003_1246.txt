I was having a really bad day and nothing seemed to be going right. I was running errands and was so frustrated that I was on the verge of tears. Suddenly I remembered that I had to buy a gift for a friend's birthday and so I entered the store in search of the perfect present.

I roamed around aimlessly for a few minutes until I stumbled upon a novelty item that looked like a radish wearing a pirate hat. I found it completely silly, but I couldn't stop myself from bursting out in a fit of laughter. 

As I picked up the item to examine it more closely, I noticed someone standing nearby also chuckling away. I lifted my head and I saw him smiling at me. We stood there for a moment, just looking at each other and laughing. Eventually, the laughter died down but something else in the air remained.

We chatted briefly, exchange names and eventually he asked me out on a date. Three years later we've been together ever since.

Every time I see that radish in the bedroom we share, I'm reminded of the moment that brought us together. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
