It was my first date with Jack, and I was nervous. We had been talking for weeks and I felt like I had made a connection with him, but this was our first time meeting in person. To calm my nerves, I decided to make a joke as soon as I saw him.

When Jack arrived, I said, "Well, hello there! I've been expecting you! I think you have something that belongs to me." 

He gave me a puzzled look and I continued, "You have my heart. I think you've taken it." 

My joke broke the tension between us, and we both starting laughing. We talked and laughed the whole night, and it was the best first date I’d ever had. We’ve been together ever since, and laughter still brings us together every day.
