The mood that Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ is one of nostalgia, reflection and hope. Rodriguez begins by reflecting on his childhood, reminiscing about the years he spent growing up in a small New Jersey town as a “child of immigrants.” He remembers the quaint establishments and the people who filled them, and how his childhood was full of culture, family, and community. 

The tone of the essay quickly changes though, when Rodriguez switches his focus to his adulthood. He writes of the most difficult chapters of his life -- his parents’ divorce, the death of his beloved grandmother and the eventual death of his father. Rodriguez masterfully guides the reader through the passages of mourning and pain, but also through finding strength, resilience and hope within himself. 

The turning point of the memoir is when Rodriguez recounts his journey to Italy and how that trip set him on his lifelong journey of becoming a world-renowned designer. He interweaves moments of joy and discovery with the hardships of learning a new language and a new culture and how he was able to embrace both without letting go of his family’s heritage. 

Through his memoir, Rodriguez evokes a mood of nostalgia and realism, but ultimately one of hope. He writes of landing back home after his Italy trip with a new sense of self and his own story to tell. His memoir is a testament to his triumph over hardship, and he encourages others to take the same journey by sharing his own experiences and wisdom gained. His message is ultimately one of hope and
