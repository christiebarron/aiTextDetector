The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski clearly has a significant impact on the cyclist. First, the road that the cyclist is riding on is described as rough, which makes pedaling even more challenging. The high elevation, which the narrator mentions early in the story, also contributes to the difficulty of the journey. As the cyclist pedals up the winding road, it gets even more grueling due to the increasing incline. The cyclist also has to contend with the wind, which tends to blow more strongly at high altitudes, making it harder for the cyclist to maintain their momentum. 

In addition to the physical features of the setting, there are also numerous psychological effects on the cyclist. The increasing difficulty of the terrain, combined with being in the middle of a seemingly never-ending trek, can make the journey seem even more challenging. The cyclist is also aware of the uncertainty of the situation - they don't know what lies ahead or how long the journey will take to complete. This lack of certainty can be quite daunting, especially with the physical difficulty of the journey that the cyclist is facing.
