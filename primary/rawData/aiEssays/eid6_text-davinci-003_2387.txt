The Empire State Building was the first building of its kind to be built with a mast or mooring tower specifically designed to facilitate the docking of dirigibles. The building's builders faced many obstacles in making this possible, which are detailed in Marcia Amidon Lüsted's article “The Mooring Mast.” 

The first issue was the lack of an existing infrastructure for dirigible docking. There were few ports outside of naval facilities, and there was no provision for suspension of aircraft from a mooring tower. On top of this, the designers had to account for the weight of the dirigible - which could potentially be more than twice the weight of the skyscraper - and the height of the tower had to be in proportion to the size of the dirigible. As a result, construction of a tower tall enough and strong enough to ensure a prosperous future for dirigible docking posed a daunting task.

Additionally, the Empire State Building had to be designed for air currents at different altitudes and wind pressures. This involved careful calculations to ensure that the design would be both stable himself enough to prevent swaying and grounded enough to provide sturdy support for the loading and unloading of the dirigible. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of those inside the building, the tower was architecturally attached to the steel structure of the building and engineers had to design an elaborate structure to form a connection between the mast and the skyscraper.

The Mast’s opening ceremony was held in 1931 and was attended by excited citizens and dignitaries garnered from around the world, basking in the engineering
