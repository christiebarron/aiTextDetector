Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic that often stirs strong emotions and opinions. Typically, libraries are places where books, music, movies and magazines can be found and enjoyed in a collective, thoughtful setting. However, some materials can be profoundly offensive; leaving many to wonder if materials of this nature should be removed from library shelves. 

I believe that library censorship should not be practiced as it censors our freedom of speech. As American citizens, we have the right to think, read and express ourselves freely. But this right is compromised if certain materials are removed from libraries, robbing people of an important source of knowledge. 

Furthermore, making blanket banning decisions on the behalf of large populations is simply wrong. Not everyone has the same moral standpoint; and many decisions can be based on deeply held personal beliefs. Therefore, leaving libraries to police themselves and decide what is “appropriate” can be unfair and unjust. What may be offensive to some may be completely appropriate to others. 

A better way to address library censorship is to encourage discourse and education as opposed to removing materials from circulation. Small labels or guides that explain which materials are inappropriate for certain age groups can be useful without taking away the choices of individuals. 

Ultimately, censorship in libraries should not be practiced as it takes away fundamental freedoms of the American people. Rather, libraries should be places where everyone can explore, enjoy and learn from materials without being judged or censored.
