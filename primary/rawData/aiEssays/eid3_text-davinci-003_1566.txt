The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” play a large role in the cyclist’s journey. The physical environment can be seen as a metaphor for the challenge of the cyclist’s path. The hill the protagonist is challenged with is a symbol for the difficulty life can often bring. It takes strength, courage, and determination to overcome it, which are also important aspects of the cyclist’s journey. The journey of the cyclist is paralleled with the struggle of getting to the top of the hill. The cyclist is faced with a number of obstacles, such as slippery patches, sharp inclines, and an oppressive sun. These are symbolic of the struggle to reach personal goals. The cyclist perseveres despite the difficulty of the journey and the gruelling effort it takes.

The heat is a physical representation of the exhaustion that comes along with the journey. The cyclist’s sweat becomes a metaphor for the determination necessary to overcome any challenge. The low hanging branches and sharp stones symbolize the obstacles and pain that accompany any journey. They are both a reminder of the need for strength and focus to overcome life’s difficulties.
