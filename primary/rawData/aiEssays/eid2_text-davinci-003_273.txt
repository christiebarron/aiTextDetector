Recent events have put the issue of censorship in libraries at the forefront of public consciousness. Libraries should be a place full of learning and exploration, which means that censorship should be kept to a minimum. 

Censoring books, music, movies, and magazines goes against the very purpose of a library, which is to provide people with access to many forms of information. While there is a need to protect the public from offensive materials, heavily censoring these items would be detrimental to the inspiring environment that libraries strive to create. Not to mention, censoring books could erase valuable references and historic accounts from existence. 

It is also important to remember that library patrons come from many different backgrounds and beliefs and that individual censorship should be reserved to the discretion of these patrons and their parents or guardians. Libraries should strive to provide access to a wide variety of materials that can spark conversations, incite curiosities, and even challenge the way we think. Ultimately, the intention should be to provide resources that are beneficial to the growth of the community. 

If certain materials are found to be offensive, the library can educate their patrons on the content and allow them to make their own decisions while still providing access. The library should be wary of censorship as it can potentially limit the right to free speech and limit access to important works. Libraries should promote and preserve learning, exploration, and discovery; which means censorship should be kept to a minimum.
