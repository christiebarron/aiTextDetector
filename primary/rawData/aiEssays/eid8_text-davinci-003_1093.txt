I was walking on the beach with my friends one summer afternoon when we heard a distant, unfamiliar sound. As we got closer we realized it was laughterâ€”loud, contagious laughter that seemed to appear out of nowhere and echo along the beach. We all stopped walking and stared curiously at each other, unsure what to make of it. 

We continued walking towards the sound and soon spotted a couple, barely visible in the distance. As we got closer, we realized they were both lying on their backs in the sand, their hands laced together as they both doubled over in laughter. 

We all turned and smiled at each other, envious of the honest joy we could see between them. The laughter was so pure, so real, that it brought a sense of peace to the beach that afternoon. We all silently shared a grateful moment together, before walking away, still in awe of what we had witnessed.
