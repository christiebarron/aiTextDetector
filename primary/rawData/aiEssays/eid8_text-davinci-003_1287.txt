I remember the first time I met my best friend. When I walked into the room, he broke into a smile and it felt like the sun had just shone in my life. We talked for hours, laughing the entire time like we had known each other our whole life. 

He was spontaneous and daring, and he was always up for anything. He had a way of making me laugh so hard, my stomach would ache. We spent every weekend going to movies, local festivals, camping trips, and concerts. Everywhere we went, people would comment on our constant laughter and catchy sense of humour. 

One day, we went to a local amusement park and decided to ride their tallest roller coaster. We were so sure of ourselves that nothing could scare us. As the coaster lurched forward, we were both scared out of our minds. 

But instead of screaming, we found ourselves laughing hysterically as if this were part of the ride. We clasped hands and laughed all the way up the track before finally being released at the top. We only stopped tearing up until the coaster slowed to a stop. 

Laughter was our bridge then, and it continues to be a bridge today. It's the thing that guides us through the moments of joy, pain, and everything in between. And it's the little things that remind us of the bond that we share. 
 Laughter truly is the best way to connect with someone.
