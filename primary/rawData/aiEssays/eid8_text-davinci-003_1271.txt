I remember it like it was yesterday. It was date night for me and my husband of four years. We decided to go out for dinner at one of our favourite Italian restaurants and it was incredibly romantic. We were both smiling and laughing throughout the night, discussing our dreams and plans for our future together. I had mentioned a silly joke I had heard recently, but could not quite remember how it ended. My husband then proceeded to try his best to tell me the joke and he was failing miserably. Without warning, we were both in complete hysterics, laughing and barely able to breathe. We continued laughing until we both had tears in our eyes. As I looked across the table, I could tell that this moment meant so much to my husband, as he was overcome with happiness. That night, I realized just how powerful laughter can be in a relationship and I am thankful that I was able to share it with my true love.
