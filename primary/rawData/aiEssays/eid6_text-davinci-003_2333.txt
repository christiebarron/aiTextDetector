The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a unique concept, especially considering the many obstacles the builders faced while attempting to make it a reality. One of the primary issues was the risk of any volatile magnetic fields created by the antenna equipment and electric wiring at the top of the building interfering with the navigation equipment of the airships. If this were to happen, the airships would be unable to land and could potentially crash into the buildings. 

Another obstacle builders had to overcome was the danger of a collision between the airships and the building itself, due to the airships being large and relatively slow moving. The solution for this was to build a tall metal mast in the center of the top of the Empire State Building, extending upwards another 319 feet and topped with a 10-foot-diameter platform. In 1934, the mooring mast design was finally completed and approved for installation. To make sure it was strong enough for airships to safely land upon, the top part of the mast was made with a steel-reinforced, triangular open-web truss and the bottom of the mast was mounted with plates that weighed more than a ton each.

In addition, they took measures to prevent the dangers of a gas leak, one of the main problems with dinghies. To do so, the airship docking platform was encased in a glass structure to contain any leaking hydrogen gas and the crew of the airship were required to stand on the platform and give a signal to show that it was safe. The platform also had an area that was waterproofed and fitted
