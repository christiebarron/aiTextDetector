Censorship in libraries is an issue of great concern to those who hold freedom of speech and expression dear. In a society that values open access to knowledge, it is important to protect the right of everyone to access print materials without suspicion or intervention from a higher authority. It is therefore essential to re-examine our current policies regarding censorship in libraries.

The majority of libraries across the United States are part of a larger system that allows each individual library to alter its policies. This can lead to the imposition of censorship on library materials that are deemed offensive by local authorities. Such censorship can deny people the opportunity to access knowledge, which is arguably an inherent human right. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves simply because their content is deemed offensive or controversial. 

It is essential that librarians and library systems strive to uphold the values of freedom of information and open access to knowledge. Libraries should instead provide access to all types of literature, while simultaneously affirming their commitment to public safety and respect for individual rights. This can be done through the introduction of policies that encourage the reporting and reviewing of potentially offensive materials, while maintaining open access to the full range of materials in the printed collection.

The library is a public place, essential to a healthy democracy, and censorship should not be used to limit access to knowledge. Taking materials off the shelves is a dangerous precedent, and censorship in libraries threatens the basic freedom of expression that is so vital to our society.
