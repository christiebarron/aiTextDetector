The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City was a vast undertaking that involved numerous obstacles and challenges. One of the most ambitious goals of the building’s designers was to make it capable of docking dirigibles, large passenger zeppelins that could be used as an alternate form of transport. This goal was no small feat, and even though the builders encountered numerous difficulties, they eventually achieved success.

The first obstacle they faced was that the mast, which would become the base of the building’s mooring deck, had to be built to accommodate the sheer bulk of the dirigibles. Thanks to some clever engineering and teamwork, construction of the mast was completed in 1932, creating a sturdy platform for use by the dirigibles.

The second challenge was how to get the dirigibles to connect safely with the base of the mast. Even though the mast was strong, the engineers associated with the Empire State Building project had to come up with a way to ensure that the mooring process was secure and safe. To solve the problem, the engineers developed a system called the “mooring mast” in which a metal eyelet at the end of a cable was attached to an eyelet on the dirigible, allowing it to be attached to the mast.

The third challenge was how to power the radio and engine systems on the dirigible in order to maintain a safe connection to the mast. To overcome this obstacle, the engineers created an electrical system that could be triggered remotely, allowing the dirigible to be powered while connected to the mast.
