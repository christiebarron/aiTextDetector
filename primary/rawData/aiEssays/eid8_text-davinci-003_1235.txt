I was at a party, surrounded by people I'd known all my life. We were catching up with one another, and things were going pretty well until one of my friends started telling a silly story that he thought was hilarious. He'd barely gotten to the punchline when everyone in the room burst into laughter, myself included. 

I was laughing so hard my sides were beginning to hurt and I was finding it hard to catch my breath. After what felt like an age, my friend and I were the only ones still laughing. We were laughing so hard we could barely speak.

I realized that I hadn't laughed like this in such a long time, and that it had been a while since I'd really been able to connect and laugh with someone on such a deep level. I was so grateful that my friend had been able to bring that joy and pleasure into my life. 

The laughter had brought us all together and created a strong bond between us all. I knew then that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
