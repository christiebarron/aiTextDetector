The idea of allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building caused quite a stir since first being proposed in 1929, and the process of allowing mooring mast construction to commence faced numerous obstacles. The call for a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building was a unique idea and posed multiple engineering challenges for the design team.

In the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author goes in depth into the difficulties faced when the Empire State Building created mooring plans for dirigibles. Being an inherently tall structure, the Empire State Building was designed to repel the winds that such high altitudes were subject to. This meant ensuring that a mooring mast could be drafted and built in a way that would protect and support the dirigible as if it were a building of its own. The first challenge was creating a sturdy structure on the roof that would not be too weighed down by the weight of the dirigible, nor be affected too adversely by the powerful winds.

The second challenge was finding the necessary materials to create such a compelling structure atop the upper reaches of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast would have to be constructed from the most durable and light-weight materials available, and that would prove to be a tricky endeavor. This meant that structural steel and other metals had to be incorporated, which concerned the builders due to the possibility of corrosion and extreme wear.

The third challenge was finding the right electrical technology to allow ships to safely land atop the Empire State Building. The challenge of safely and securely wiring the buildings power
