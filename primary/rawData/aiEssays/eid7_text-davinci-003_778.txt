I remember a time where I was struggling with a math equation and got so frustrated I wanted to give up. I was about to just turn in the unfinished problem when my math teacher asked me if I needed help. I didn't want to admit I needed help, so I told him no. He smiled and said he was there if I needed anything. He waited patiently as I kept trying to figure it out. 

After pouring over the equation again and again, I finally had a breakthrough. I worked out the solution with a strange sense of accomplishment and a smile on my face. 

My teacher had been watching the whole time and gave me a thumbs up when I finished. Even though he was patient enough to wait for me, I know he could have easily finished the problem for me. But instead, he chose to give me the time I needed to work it out for myself. 

That experience left an impression on me and made me appreciate those who are patient with me.
