The ending of Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” speaks to renewal and hope. While the young protagonist, Audry, is uncertain if she will pass the citizenship test in the winter, the way she is comforted by her grandfather suggests that the season will pass and something new will take its place. This can be seen in the repetition of the phrase “when they come back in the spring” which references the new life that will come to the hibiscus flower when it blooms against the backdrop of melting snow, and the return of the geese to symbolize the start of a new chapter in Audry’s life. 

The phrase “then I will take that test again” is significant as it implies Audry’s resilience and determination for bettering her future despite the odds. It speaks to her strength and her capacity to navigate through the challenges she is facing. The hibiscus that has endured a harsh winter serves as a parallel to Audry’s current situation. Despite having to learn more English and further study for the test, she can find strength in the knowledge that the challenges she’s facing are temporary just like the winter was.

In conclusion, the ending of Ho’s poem works as a reminder that everything is temporary and that even through the most challenging of times, there is hope for a better tomorrow. The hibiscus acts as a metaphor of Audry’s growth and resilience, reminding the reader that obstacles can be overcome in the same way that the cold winter
