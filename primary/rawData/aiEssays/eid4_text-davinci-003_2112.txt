Minfong Ho's "Winter Hibiscus" is a reflective poem about a student who is struggling to grasp a difficult math problem. The student's teacher is convinced that the student is capable of much more, and that with encouragement and determination, the student will succeed. This optimistic insight is contemplative, as it embraces the idea of starting anew with spring.

The poem concludes with the student taking a psychological test in the spring, after the snows melt, geese return and the hibiscus plants bud. It symbolizes the student's personal journey of growth, perseverance and hope. The poem implies that the student will have gained a greater understanding of the math problem and have the confidence to take the test again.

Spring is usually associated with new beginnings and personal growth, making it the perfect time for the student to take the test. In winter, the student was at a standstill, feeling discouraged by the daunting task. But by spring, the student has gained encouragement and much-needed insight. With warmer weather and blooming plants, such as the hibiscus, comes a sense of renewal and rejuvenation.

The student has come to a point in their journey of self-discovery where their newfound confidence allows them to take on any challenge, thus the phrase â€œThen I will take that test again." The student has made great strides in understanding math and has found newfound strength and confidence. They prove to themselves and their teacher that anything is possible with determination, dedication, and a healthy dose of optimism.
