In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting deeply affect the cyclist.

At the beginning of the poem, the cyclist is in a remote place, isolated from the general bustle of city life, with miles of unpaved roads before them. The cyclist is able to observe and note the purely natural elements without distraction—beautiful stretches of fields, valleys, forests, and rolling hills. These vast area of open terrain allow for a sense of freedom and exploration to the cyclist, a feeling of being completely surrounded by Nature.

Later, when curve after curve of the cycling route continues to bring the cyclist further and further away from the city, the view of the horizon stretches further. The lack of buildings and space left for unpredictability, for the unexpected dangers of the road, reveals a brave, wild landscape. The cyclist’s journey is made more daunting, but also more enjoyable, as the rising and lowering of the bumps, the trees, the puddles and mud, each bring a unique thrill in their own way.
