The construction of the Empire State Building posed a unique challenge for the engineers and builders of the era—how to equip the building with a structure that would permit the docking of large dirigibles. This task, while potentially lucrative, was also a technically complicated undertaking—one that posed numerous obstacles along the way. 

The first challenge the engineers and builders of the Empire State Building faced was designing a mast that could support the weight of a dirigible. The dock would be situated on the uppermost level of the skyscraper, so any mooring mast had to be strong enough to bear the load. Next, the mast had to be equipped with a tethering apparatus to secure the airship. Hydraulic brakes had to be included in the design to keep the ship in place while the passengers stepped off. Finally, the upper plank of the mooring mast had to be completely level so that the dirigible would land safely. 

In addition to bringing the design of the mast to fruition, another great obstacle was getting the Alcoa Corporation to produce the aluminum parts for this project. The unique structure had to be made out of an alloy of aluminum and copper, known as duralumin. Finding a manufacturer for this alloy was no easy feat during the Great Depression, but eventually the engineers were able to procure the parts from the Alcoa Corporation.

The third and final obstacle was constructing the dock in a way that it wouldn’t interfere with the solidity of the building. Since it was situated near the 102nd floor, it posed a serious problem for the structural integrity of the skysc
