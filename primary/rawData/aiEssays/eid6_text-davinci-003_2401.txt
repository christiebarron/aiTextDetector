The construction of the Empire State Building was an unprecedented feat of engineering and architecture. But the idea of permitting dirigibles to dock on its roof was an even more ambitious undertaking. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, we get a glimpse at the remarkable obstacles these builders and engineers had to overcome in order to create the mooring mast necessary for airships to dock.

The first major obstacle was the fact that the mast had to be built directly atop one of the world’s tallest buildings. Constructing a mooring tower at that height required special techniques and materials, as well as skilled engineers and designers. Furthermore, the Empire State Building’s strong winds posed a major challenge, as the tower had to be able to bear the strain of even the strongest gusts without succumbing to fatigue or buckling.

The mooring mast also had to be able to withstand major airship traffic. Each dirigible was capable of carrying massive loads of passengers and freight, meaning the tower had to be able hold this additional weight without straining itself or the building beneath it. Furthermore, the mast had to be able to support the strain of mooring ropes—all of this occurring at an altitude of 1,250 feet.

Finally, the Empire State Building had to be equipped with a tall enough mast. At the time, modern airships were able to reach previously unheard of altitudes, meaning the tower had to be tall enough to give the airships enough clearance to reach the ground safely. After much engineering and design work, it
