I remember one of the most special days of my life. My husband had decided to surprise me with a romantic dinner night, at home. We had the whole dinner table set up outside, in our garden underneath the night sky. We had just finished our delicious dinner when my husband said something that made me laugh so hard!

He said "I bought you a gift for this special night" and I was so excited to open it. But when I opened it, I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a giant toy dump truck! I couldn't believe it and started laughing my head off.

My husband had no idea why I was laughing, so I explained to him that this was not the romantic gift I was expecting! Of course, he didn't take it seriously like I did and started cracking jokes. Soon enough, it was both of us laughing at the absurdity of a toy dump truck as a romantic gift.

We laughed and talked for hours, and it was one of the best evenings I had ever experienced. We just sat together, laughing, enjoying the night and being together. In that moment, we shared something special. And we both knew that even if our relationship is sometimes difficult and challenging, the laughter we had that night created a bond between us that was unbreakable.
