 

It was a Saturday night, and I was out to dinner with my friends, enjoying a much-needed break from the stress of studying for midterms. Most of us had ordered the same dish, and I was kind of bored with the conversation. A couple of my friends were talking about the latest gossip they had heard on campus, but it wasn’t really my thing so I just sat there quietly, scrolling through my Instagram feed. 

Suddenly, one of my friends started telling a funny story that inevitably sparked something inside all of us. We started laughing hysterically, making jokes and adding our own funny details to the story. It felt so nice to be in the middle of this frenzy, to simply be with the people I cared about, to know that I was accepted and appreciated, even in my silence. 

The laughter flowed around us, unifying us in a way I hadn’t experienced for a long time. My whole body felt like one big smile and I didn’t want this moment to end. We were making memories that were quickly becoming part of our friendship. I felt elated, knowing that laughter was bridging the gap between us and that this bond could bring us closer together in a way that nothing else ever could. 

It was a beautiful reminder of the power of laughing together. I now knew that laughter was the shortest distance between two people, no matter the circumstance.
