The Empire State Building has long been renowned as one of the most iconic structures in New York City. Constructed in 1930â€“1931 and standing tall at 1,454 feet, the tall light-colored skyscraper serves as a reminder of the great architectural advances made in the early 20th century. Yet, one of the unique features of the building that is often forgotten is its involvement in the history of dirigibles, or airships. Although its construction was finished before airship travel became commonplace in the United States, the builders of the Empire State Building incorporated the design of a mooring mast into the building, which would later be used to allow dirigibles to dock.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First and foremost, the mooring mast had to be able to withstand the extreme conditions of wind and turbulence produced by the airships. Without the proper considerations in place, the mooring mast would not be able to support the airships as requested. Secondly, the mooring mast needed to be able to be safely extended above the skyscraper to differentiate it from the aircrafts. This, in turn, would require significant structural changes to the building and the incorporation of additional equipment, such as a powerful electric winch, to raise and lower the mast. Finally, the designers of the mooring mast had to be able to coordinate their efforts with the actual landing and docking of the airships. Drawing on research related to airship design, the engineers had to develop a new set of strategies and principles to ensure the safety of both
