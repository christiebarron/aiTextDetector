The building of the Empire State Building in 1931 marked a major technological and engineering achievement. While the building remains iconic to this day, one of its most ambitious features was its inclusion of a 200-foot tall mast and gondola crane thought to have been designed to facilitate and enable the docking of dirigibles. The attempt to build a mast tall enough to serve as an anchoring device for lighter-than-air crafts presented a truly unique challenge.

The first hurdle facing the builders was the incredible height of the mast needed to reach the typical 640 feet above ground level for mooring. Safety concerns made it paramount that the mast remain structurally sound and not succumb to wind stress, so extra precautions were taken to make sure the mast met those requirements. To ensure the extra strength required, engineers employed deep steel foundations and solid steel bars, weighing more than two tons. In all, the mooring mast incorporated 450 tons of steel.

The next obstacle was the mast's ability to endure weather conditions. The mast was designed to swivel automatically, so that when a dirigible neared the Empire State Building, the mast would lean in the direction of the wind and create an anchor point for the approaching ship. This movement, however, was still a very risky business, as the mast had to be able to turn fast enough so as to not be thrown off course by the winds. Furthermore, due to the buildingâ€™s height, winds around the Empire State Building were found to be significantly faster than those at sea level, which added to the operational challenge of the mast.

Finally, the
