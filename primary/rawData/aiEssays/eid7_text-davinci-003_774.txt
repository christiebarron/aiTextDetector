I was at the grocery store the other day, and the line I was standing in seemed to move agonizingly slow. Everyone in line in front of me needed help from the cashier, which took a long time. People were getting frustrated and some of them started to grumble. I tried my best to stay calm and remembered to stay patient. 

I was reminded of the importance of being patient in a situation when there's nothing to be done other than wait and be understanding. Instead of getting frustrated and angry, I decided to listen to the music playing in the background and use the extra time to think about what I wanted to make for dinner. 

At last, it was my turn. The cashier scanned my items, but the machine kept displaying an error message. He had to get help from the manager to fix the problem and it took some time. Everyone else behind me started grumbling and I heard them criticize the cashier. But I just smiled and waited patiently. 

After the manager came, the problem was quickly solved. I thanked the cashier for helping me out, even though it took a bit longer than usual. I was proud of myself for not getting angry or impatient in a difficult situation like that. Being patient was definitely the best thing to do.
