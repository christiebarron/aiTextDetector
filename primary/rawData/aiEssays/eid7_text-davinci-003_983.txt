I remember one time at my old job when a customer was getting agitated and seemed to be growing increasingly impatient.  Our company was very busy and the person in front of her had been taking a while explaining their issue in detail.  I could sense her impatience and I was starting to become a bit on edge myself, but I was determined to stay calm and be patient. 

So, I continued to assist the other customer and was sure to be patient and polite as I answered their questions as best I could.  I think the customer in front of me appreciated my calm attitude and respected my efforts to be understanding and accommodating.  

After a few more minutes, the other customer had finished with their questions and I was able to address my agitated customerâ€™s needs.  I continued to be patient and understanding throughout the entire process and eventually even managed to get a small smile out of her.  Even though it took some time and effort on my part, I was so happy to see her leave the shop in a good mood, and that made it all worth it.
