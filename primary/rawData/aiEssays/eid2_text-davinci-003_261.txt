There has been much debate about whether or not censorship should be imposed in libraries around the country. Some feel that the library is a place for open discussion and the sharing of a wide variety of ideas and perspectives, while others feel that libraries should provide protection for the public from offensive materials.

As an avid library user, I strongly feel that censorship of certain materials in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries provide a much-needed service to their community, and it is important that these services remain accessible and inviting to all. If a library chooses to impose censorship, it limits the range of topics a person can access, which can be detrimental to public education. 

Furthermore, censorship can be difficult to enforce. Libraries draw patrons with a wide variety of opinions and interests, so it is difficult to determine which material should be deemed offensive and removed from the shelves. Not only is this mission impossible, but it also gives great power to those making the decisions; if a book with controversial content is banned, it takes away the publicâ€™s ability to make their own judgment about its content.

All library patrons should be given access to a wide variety of books, music, movies, and magazines so they can make their own decisions about which material is appropriate for them. Libraries should not serve as a censor of ideas and materials, but rather as a safe haven for learning and exploration. Censorship in libraries erodes free speech and deprives individuals of the power of their own judgement, and is an unacceptable practice.
