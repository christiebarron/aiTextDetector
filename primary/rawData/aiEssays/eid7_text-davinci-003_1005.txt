I was recently in line at the bank, and I noticed that the teller was having a difficult time with one customer. They were having a discussion about fees that were going to be assessed, and the customer was becoming more and more agitated. I knew that the teller was only doing her job, and I knew that this was a difficult situation for her. 

So, to ensure that everyone was comfortable, I decided to be patient and wait until the customer's issue was resolved. I waited and watched without saying anything, while the customer became more and more frustrated and the teller began to get flustered. 

Eventually, the teller was able to resolve the customer's issue, and the customer left the bank calmer than when they came in. I was relieved that the situation was over and proud of myself for being so patient and understanding.
