I remember a time when I was really struggling to understand a difficult mathematics problem. I kept trying to figure it out, but it just didn't seem to make sense. 

I was feeling frustrated and starting to get angry. I felt like I was never going to figure it out.

Then I heard a voice behind me. It was my teacher, and she asked me why I was so upset. I explained the problem to her, and she said she'd help me.

But instead of rushing in with the solution, she took her time and helped me work through it. She pointed out what I was doing wrong, and explained why. Even when I still felt confused, she was patient and took the time to go over it again and again until I finally understood.

In the end, I didn't just understand the answer, but I had a better understanding of the mathematics as a whole. I am so thankful for my teacher's patience that day, as it not only helped me solve the problem, but it also increased my confidence in my abilities.
