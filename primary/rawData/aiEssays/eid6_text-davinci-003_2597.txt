The Empire State Building was a monumental feat of engineering, constructed in the heart of New York City in the early 1930s. When it was completed, the plan was to allow dirigibles, or zeppelins, to dock atop the building, and for over a decade, it was the only skyscraper in the world equipped with a mooring mast, allowing these unique vessels tofuel, rest, and accommodate passengers. However, the moorers of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock atop the engineering wonder.

For starters, the airship technology was still relatively new, and even though they had been used in both military and commercial applications, the catastrophic crashes of two famous zeppelins—the Hindenburg and the USS Akron—served as a grim reminder of safety issues with the technology. Considering this, the Empire State moorers had to set stringent safety protocols for their dirigible docking. They completely redesigned the outer-shell of the mooring mast, adding unique features such as a handrail, steps, and elevator, to prevent debris from falling from the dirigibles onto the streets below. They also enforced regulations requiring pilots to hold a Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) license, and to pass a strict physical exam before being cleared for airship docking. 

In addition to safety-related challenges, the moorers had to account for the unpredictable weather around New York City. The mooring mast was designed with an adjustable-height feature, enabling the mast to ascend above or retract below certain cloud ceilings, depending on the prevailing weather conditions. Unfortunately, the
