The memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez captures a complex, diverse and transnational mood. His story is unique because he writes not only as an immigrant, but also a refugee who experienced moving between different countries, ranging from Puerto Rico to the United States and even Mexico. Through his personal narrative, Rodriguez creates an emotional and nostalgic atmosphere, reminiscing on both the hardships and joys of growing up in various grounds.

Rodriguez often reflects back to the impact his mother had on him growing up, recognizing the challenges she faced trying to protect her family and acknowledge her strength for rising above it all. He brilliantly juxtaposes themes of loneliness and love that lingers in his recollections. Rodriguez tenderly weaves in his own love for music and his understanding of identity through his shoes as signs of independence. This gives a flavor of hope and determination throughout the memoir.

Rodriguez also puts in focus how the hardships of immigration and displacement affected his family and friends. By reading, we feel how his spirit was squashed, yet not fully broken, as he laments on the humanistic suffering of his people. Ultimately, we feel his admiration of the unbreakable human spirit, and the determination of his people against odds. 

The memoir brings us thoughts of sorrow, joy, and hope, but above all, the creator of the mood, Rodriguez directs us through a tenderness of nostalgia and personal connection. The memoir begs us to remember the plight of immigrants and refugees, while also cherishing the unique hopes and experiences of each family.
