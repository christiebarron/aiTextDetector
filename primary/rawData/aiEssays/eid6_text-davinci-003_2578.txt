The Empire State Building was an incredible feat of engineering, its iconic shape and height quickly making it a symbol of American prosperity and the cutting edge of modern construction. But what many don't know is that in addition to the intricate and complex construction of the building itself, the workmen had to plan and make accommodations for a somewhat less traditional type of arrival at the top: dirigibles. This was no small task, largely due to the number of obstacles they had to overcome.

The first obstacle the builders had to overcome was the sheer size of a dirigible. As outlined in "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the 1936 Empire State Building guidelines meant that the mooring mast had to be able to support a "dirigible envelope," that is, a rigid framework large enough to enclose the dirigible. This presented a significant challenge to the builders, as the structure had to be incredibly strong in order to hold the weight of the dirigible without causing structural damage to the building. Additionally, to accommodate the dirigible’s arrival, the mast had to be located within the open rooftop space, meaning builders had to ensure that the mooring mast would be unobtrusive to the engineering of the building.

The builders also had to consider the safety of the passengers on the dirigible. As Lüsted outlines, the mooring mast had to be strongly secured to the building in order to avoid it splitting and falling away. Furthermore, to ensure that dirigible passengers were able to disembark safely, the engineers had to install a tensioned wire system on the
