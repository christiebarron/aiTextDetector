Dear Editor,

Our lives today are filled with computers, from the laptops and tablets we carry around to the ones we use at work. Everywhere we look, they are infiltrating our lives and rapidly changing the way we interact with one another.

I strongly believe that the effects of computers have been largely positive. Computers have enabled us to become more connected with one another. Through social networking, text, and email, we can stay in touch with friends, family and colleagues across vast distances. This newfound connectedness has allowed us to collaborate better in our work, and to remain close despite being far apart.

Moreover, computers have enabled us to be creative in ways that were never before possible. With the advent of powerful software, anyone with the commitment to learn how to use it can become a master of digital art, photography, music production, web design and more. Creative industries are changing in rapid and exciting ways due to computers.

I am not blind to the potential risks caused by computers. Issues such as cyberbullying, digital addiction, and identity theft, to name a few, must be addressed and prevented. But if used responsibly and with a spirit of kindness, computers offer incredible advantages for communication, innovation, and friendships.

I believe strongly that the effects of computers are overwhelmingly positive, and I hope that you too will come to the same conclusion.

Sincerely,

[Name]
