I recently had to take my daughter to a doctor's appointment for a routine checkup. We were running late and we thought that the doctor's office was going to be closed by the time we got there. We were both really frustrated because my daughter had taken the time to get ready for the appointment and it seemed like we had wasted her time. 

When we arrived, however, the receptionist told us that the doctor was still in and she was willing to wait for us to show up if we hurried. I was overwhelmed with relief and grateful that the office had been so understanding and patient with us. 

I couldn't help but feel a bit embarrassed, but we both thanked the receptionist for her patience and we went into the doctor's office. The doctor was also very understanding of our situation and willing to work with us. 

It felt very relieving to have someone be so patient and understanding with us, especially since it wasn't our intention to waste anyone's time. I made a mental note to not leave things so close to the wire when scheduling appointments in the future so that I didn't have to rely on the kindness of others.
