The construction of the Empire State Building was one of the greatest achievements of modern engineering. Although the building was designed primarily with the idea of having an observation deck, the builders also had plans of allowing dirigibles to moor or dock at the building. This created various obstacles for the builders to overcome, as it was quite a unique engineering challenge.

The main issue to overcome was finding a way to allow the heavy airships to dock at the top of the building. The builders started from the idea that a mooring mast should be installed at the top. The mast itself would have to be strong enough to support not only the weight of the airships, but also have to have the ability to rotate in order to make it easier for the airships to set down. The engineers had to design some complex systems in order to create the right mooring mast, as it would be exposed to constant changes of winds and weather conditions. 

The placement of the mast also posed a challenge, as the designers had to make sure that the operation of the mast did not interfere with the overall structure of the building. To this end, they designed a slightly slanted mast that would balance itself in the wind as the airship landed. This design would also allow the mast to be placed further away from the sides of the building, avoiding any potential interference with future structures or windows.

In addition to the mast, the engineers also had to create a system of cables that could be used to secure the dirigible to the building. The cables connected to the upper part of the mast, with lines going down to
