I had recently signed up for a class that was offered in my community, but I was quite nervous as it was a new experience. On the first day of class, the instructor began talking about a lot of unfamiliar concepts to me, and I started to feel a little overwhelmed. Before I could say anything, however, a classmate turned to me and asked if I needed help with the material. She listened intently as I asked questions and explained what I did and did not understand. She was incredibly patient with me, taking the time to slowly explain each concept and make sure I understood before we moved on. 

At the end of the class, I thanked her for her patience and willingness to help me out. She smiled and said what she always told people in a similar situation: “Don't be intimidated by new material. That's why we're all here. We can help each other out and grow together.” I was incredibly grateful for her kindness and understanding.
