The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski affects the cyclist in a variety of ways. The setting includes a road without a shoulder, a steep hill, and a wooded area.

The lack of a shoulder on the road is a source of danger for the cyclist. It limits the options for where he can ride, as he can no longer ride safely within the shoulder. This increases his chance of encountering vehicles on the road, which presents danger. It also further limits the choices of routes available to him, as he is restricted to roads without a shoulder.

The steep hill in the setting also affects the cyclist. It makes the ride more difficult and can even be hazardous if he is not sufficiently prepared to handle a steep grade. He may have to get off and walk up the hill if his bike is not able to handle the grade. This can create a safety risk if he finds himself walking on the side of the road.

The wooded area can also present a challenge for the cyclist. The lack of clear visibility can mean that he runs the risk of not seeing any oncoming vehicles in the area. It can also be difficult to maneuver the bike on
