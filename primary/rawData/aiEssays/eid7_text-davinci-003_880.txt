I remember the time I volunteered at a soup kitchen. During my shift, the lines of people waiting were growing longer, but the kitchen staff were still struggling to keep up with all the orders. They were anxiously shouting orders to each other and had grown increasingly frustrated. 

I decided to help out by taking orders so that the kitchen staff would have fewer tasks to multitask. Even though I had never done this type of work before, I kept my cool and remained patient as I took orders from the people in line. I could feel their relief that someone was finally helping out and taking their orders. 

With each passing customer, I was slowly learning the process as well as some of the relationships between the kitchen staff and the volunteers. I was determined to be helpful and patient so I kept at it even when small mistakes were made. I eventually got the hang of things and by the end of the shift, I had successfully taken the orders of dozens of people and helped out the kitchen staff. 

It’s moments like these that remind me how valuable patience and understanding can be in any setting and I’m glad that I was able to help out and make a difference.
