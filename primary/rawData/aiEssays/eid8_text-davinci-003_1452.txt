I was on a camping trip with my family when I was around 10 years old. It was an ordinary Saturday in the middle of summer, with the warm sun and long shadows in the forest. Our campsite was nestled between the tall trees and we had just finished lunch when everyone started to get a bit sleepy. So my dad decided to tell us a silly joke. We all sat around the fire, expectantly waiting to hear what would come out of his mouth. 

When he finally told his joke, we all burst out laughing. It was such a ridiculous joke and I found myself doubling over with laughter, tears streaming down my cheeks. Even my mom, who's normally so serious, was laughing harder than us. Everyone was in stitches for what felt like forever. I'll never forget the happy feeling of being surrounded by family, laughter ringing out through the stillness of the forest. 

That moment of shared laughter will always stay with me. It became an important reminder that even though we are from different walks of life, laughing together can bring people closer and create a bond between them.
