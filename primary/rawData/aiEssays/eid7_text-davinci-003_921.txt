I recently had the opportunity to witness a great display of patience. I was with a group of friends when a good friend of mine, Tom, got a call from a family member who was having a health issue. Tom had to leave abruptly without having enough time to even say goodbye.

The rest of us were a little frustrated but still understanding. It was in that moment that I noticed one of Tom’s friends, Brian, being incredibly patient. Instead of getting angry or frustrated at the sudden departure, he calmly reassured us that Tom had his reasons for leaving and that it was okay.

What really stood out to me was Brian’s ability to not just internalize the frustrations but to see the bigger picture. He was so understanding of the situation and found within himself the strength to be patient.

I was really taken aback by Brian’s maturity and patience, and it has given me something to aspire to. I’m now trying to be more patient with the people around me, and I know it will help me in the long run.
