The Empire State Building has been an iconic symbol of the New York City skyline since its opening in 1931. Its iconic status comes in part from the original plan to be the first building to feature the docking of dirigibles. However, the builders of the Empire State Building were met with obstacles in their attempt to offer a safe haven from docking dirigibles. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, The Mooring Mast, she details the various challenges that the Empire State Building builders would have to overcome to ensure a safe experience for dirigible passengers.

One significant challenge that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the issue of weather. Dirigibles rely on consistent atmospheric pressure, which is unpredictable due to passing winds. Winds can range from gentle, avoidable gusts to strong, damaging gusts that can cause turbulence and force the dirigible to veer off course. Wind currents are unpredictable and the builders of the Empire State Building had to devise a plan to reduce the strain on the dirigible's mooring mast when it was buffeted by strong winds.

The solution was to isolate the mooring mast in the center of the Empire State Building by building it away from the outer walls of the skyscraper. This enabled the three-story mast to absorb the shock of strong winds without damaging the dirigible. It also minimized the swaying motion of the mast which could lead to motion sickness in passengers. The mast was designed to support the weight of the dirigibles and was outfitted with an elevator service system to raise and lower dirigibles safely.
