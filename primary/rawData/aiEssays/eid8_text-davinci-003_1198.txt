I recently moved into a new neighborhood and was feeling a bit lonely. I wasn't used to living alone in an unfamiliar place yet, and didn't quite feel settled. One day, while I was out getting lunch, I ran into an elderly lady who moved in across the street. We exchanged smiles, although I could tell she seemed to be feeling a bit down.

As we were about to part ways, she suddenly started to tell me a joke. I was hesitant at first, but eventually gave in and chuckledâ€”and then she began to laugh. It felt like a beam of sunshine suddenly lit up the street.

Every time I pass her on my walks now, we share a joke or two and a giggle. In that moment of laughter, I'm reminded that I'm not alone, and I'm so grateful to know a kind heart like hers.
