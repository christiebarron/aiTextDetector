Every day, librarians across the country face the complex issue of censorship. Is it their place as stewards of knowledge to protect material that may be found offensive, or should materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if they cause offense? 

This is no simple answer. Some argue that to remove material is to practice censorship and to deny individuals their freedom of expression, while others argue that some offensive material is too damaging and disruptive to certain communities to stay on the shelves.
