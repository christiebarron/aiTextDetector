As the poem progresses, the hibiscus begins to take on different meanings, going from a physical manifestation of beauty to something that represents perseverance in the face of difficulty. By ending the poem with the protagonist vowing to take a test again “when the snows melt and the geese return,” it appears as though the speaker has developed a sense of hope and determination which arose from their study of the bud.

Symbolically, the snows melting and the geese returning paint a picture of new beginnings, with the hope of spring that follows. The geese themselves can be seen as representing the idea of freedom and resurgence, as they often migrate each year, fittingly metaphorically lasting the storms of winter.
