I was out with a group of friends at a local ice cream parlor enjoying some much needed quality time. After navigating the tough task of picking one flavor out of the dozens offered, we were all ready to get our cones and find a place to sit. As soon as we sat down, the conversation began to flow freely and the laughter started to fill the shop. 

We talked about everything and nothing at the same time. Nothing in particular was so funny, it was just the way the conversation kept meandering from one story to the next that made us all crack up. After a few minutes it was like we were all connected, not only by our shared experiences but by the laughter that was setting the tone for our time together. I had never felt a connection like that before.

As our time came to a close the mood was light and everyone was still smiling. I felt so lucky to have had that time with my friends and to laugh with them like that. It was a reminder that sometimes all it takes is a little laughter to make a connection.
