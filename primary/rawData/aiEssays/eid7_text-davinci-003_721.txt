I was recently on a long train ride from Chicago to Miami and it was taking longer than I had expected. I hadn't done my research before my trip and didn't realize the entire trip would take about 18 hours. I was getting frustrated, especially because I had been traveling for the past few weeks and was quite tired. The woman in the seat next to me noticed my agitation and asked if I was okay. I said I was just getting bored, to which she responded with a knowing smile and said, "You just need to be patient!" 

I sighed and nodded in agreement. She helped me to put my frustration aside by encouraging me to observe the passing scenery and chat with her about our travels. We ended up talking for the remainder of the trip and I arrived to my destination in a much calmer and happier state of mind. She reminded me that enjoying life is all about having patience, which is a trait I am determined to embrace.
