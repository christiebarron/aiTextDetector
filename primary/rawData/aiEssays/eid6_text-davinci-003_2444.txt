The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building's top. Among the myriad difficulties that had to be faced, three stand out as salient issues. Most notable was the challenge of bringing large objects, like a dirigible, down to the ground in the tight confines of a busy urban area. Additionally, the infrastructure for safely mooring the airships had to be established and the building had to be designed to handle the strain and weight of a large airship without impairing the structural integrity of either the building and the airship. 

The development of a mast-like structure, called the “mooring mast”, proved to be a crucial piece in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. As described in ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the mast was created to replace the tether system that had been initially proposed as it was deemed too dangerous for a built-up city center. With the implementation of a mooring mast, there was no need to send the airship down to the ground to establish a secure connection, thereby eliminating the risks associated with handling a large dirigible in a busy urban area.

The structure of the mooring mast was designed by a team of engineers and architects to withstand the rigors and stresses inflicted upon it by the particular motions of an airship while docked. According to ‘The Mooring Mast’, the mooring mast contained several features designed to provide an anchor for the airship. On the
