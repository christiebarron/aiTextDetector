The builders of the Empire State Building faced some unique obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. The main obstacle was the immense height and weight of the Empire State Building. With an unprecedented height of 1,454 feet, the Empire State Building was an unprecedented engineering feat. As such, the sheer scale of the building posed a challenge for the designers, who needed to ensure the building could exist structurally, while also incorporating a system designed to assist in the docking of airships.

Because airships of the era were so large, it was difficult to determine how the size and weight of the Empire State Building would affect the landing station. With the building so tall, would gusts of wind at rooftop level cause the airships to crash due to insufficient stability? Moreover, if the mooring mast were to be constructed, where would it be placed, and how would its placement affect wind conditions on the landing platform? As a result of these questions, the designers of the Empire State Building took extra precautions when considering the construction of a mooring mast.

The designers of the Empire State Building opted to incorporate a mooring mast, albeit with a slightly reduced dimensions from those found on airships of the era. The mooring mast was equipped with a steel net at the bottom, as well as netting on the sides, which was intended to hold the airship in place. The mooring mast was set into place, extending up beyond the height of the building by 375 feet. In order to mitigate the likelihood of accident due to turbulence and wind, the airship was required to
