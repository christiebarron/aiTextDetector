Once, I was out shopping with my little sister when I noticed she had left her favorite teddy bear in the car. I was frustrated, but my parents had drilled into us the importance of being patient in trying times. 

I took a moment to pause and breathe, then said to my sister calmly and patiently, "We have to go back outside and get your teddy bear. It'll just take a minute and you can carry it with you the whole time." 

My sister's face lit up and she thanked me for being patient and understanding. We returned to the car and soon were back inside the store, my sister embracing her beloved teddy bear the whole time. I'm proud that I was patient in the moment and was able to give my sister the support she needed.
