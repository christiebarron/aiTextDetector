An Analysis of Macbeth’s Ambition
Macbeth is one of the most famous plays written by William Shakespeare. It tells the story of a Scottish general named Macbeth who receives a prophecy from three witches that he will become king. Driven by his ambition, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the throne for himself. However, his ambition ultimately leads to his downfall as he becomes consumed by guilt and paranoia.
Ambition is a central theme in Macbeth, and it is what drives the plot forward. From the very beginning of the play, we see that Macbeth is ambitious and desires power. When he first hears the witches’ prophecy, he is intrigued and excited at the prospect of becoming king. He says:
“Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.By Sinel’s death I know I am thane of Glamis;But how of Cawdor? The thane of Cawdor lives,A prosperous gentleman; and to be kingStands not within the prospect of belief,No more than to be Cawdor.”
Here we see that Macbeth is already thinking about how he can become king. He wants to know more about the prophecy and what it means for him.
As the play progresses, we see that Macbeth’s ambition becomes more intense. He becomes obsessed with becoming king and will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. When Lady Macbeth suggests that they should kill King Duncan in order to take the throne, Macbeth initially hesitates. However, Lady Macbeth appeals to his ambition by questioning his manhood:
“When you durst do it, then you were a man;And to be more than what you were, you wouldBe so much more the man.”
This appeal to his masculinity convinces Macbeth to go through with the murder.
After killing Duncan and taking the throne for himself, we see that Macbeth’s ambition has not been satisfied. He becomes paranoid about anyone who might threaten his position as king and orders the murder of anyone he sees as a threat. This includes Banquo, who was also present when the witches made their prophecy, and Macduff’s family.
Macbeth’s ambition has now turned into a ruthless desire for power. He is no longer driven by a desire to be king but by a fear of losing his position. This fear ultimately leads to his downfall as he becomes consumed by guilt and paranoia.
The consequences of Macbeth’s ambition are clear throughout the play. We see how it affects not only him but also those around him. Lady Macbeth is driven mad by her guilt over Duncan’s murder, and Macduff seeks revenge for the murder of his family. The country itself is plunged into chaos as Macbeth’s reign becomes more tyrannical.
In many ways, Macbeth can be seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition. Shakespeare shows us that while ambition can be a powerful motivator, it can also lead to destruction if left unchecked. By portraying Macbeth as an ambitious character who becomes consumed by his desire for power, Shakespeare warns us about the dangers of unchecked ambition.
However, it is important to note that not all ambition is bad. Ambition can be a positive force if it is channeled in the right way. For example, we see characters like Malcolm and Macduff who are ambitious but use their ambition to do good rather than harm.
Malcolm wants to reclaim the throne from Macbeth so that he can restore order to Scotland:
“Let us seek out some desolate shade and thereWeep our sad bosoms empty.”
Macduff wants revenge for the murder of his family but also wants to restore order to Scotland:
“Bleed bleed poor country!Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure,For goodness dare not check thee: wear thou thy wrongs;The title is affeer’d! Fare thee well, lord:I would not be the villain that thou think’stFor the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,And the rich East to boot.”
These characters show us that ambition can be a positive force if it is used for good. They are driven by a desire to make things better and are willing to work hard to achieve their goals.
In conclusion, Macbeth is a play about ambition and its consequences. Shakespeare shows us how unchecked ambition can lead to destruction and chaos. Macbeth’s desire for power ultimately leads to his downfall as he becomes consumed by guilt and paranoia. However, it is important to note that not all ambition is bad. Ambition can be a positive force if it is channeled in the right way. Characters like Malcolm and Macduff show us that ambition can be used for good if it is driven by a desire to make things better rather than a desire for personal gain.
