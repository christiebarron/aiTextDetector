Growing up, my best friend was like a brother to me. We shared laughs, adventures, and stories. On our first day of college, we were feeling a bit overwhelmed, so when I saw my friend across the campus square, I jumped up and waved wildly.

My friend got the hint, and soon we were walking towards each other, feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety about this new stage in our lives. As I welcomed him in for a hug, I let out a small bark, to which he replied with a surprised laugh. It was like we both realized that college was a fresh start for us and we could still be silly and keep our humor.

The hug quickly turned into a laughing fit that both of us tried to stifle while people walking by gawked at us.

That was the moment I realized that no matter how little time we'd have to see each other while we were in college, I had my best friend to laugh with me in those moments of insanity. This has always been our special way of connecting. Even when life changes or we are oceans apart, one silly giggle links us right back together.
