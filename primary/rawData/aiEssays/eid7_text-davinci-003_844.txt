I recently encountered a situation where being patient really paid off. I had been hired to help out as a fifth grade teacher at a local elementary school and I enthusiastically began my duties. On the first day of class, I quickly realized that one of my students, Edward, was behind the rest of the class in terms of his mastery of the curriculum. I quickly developed an individualized teaching plan for Edward, but he was often slow to grasp the concepts. I kept working with him for months, but it never seemed like he was making any real progress. 

Then one day, I noticed a change. Edward was beginning to understand the concepts, and he was asking thoughtful questions. I could see that he was getting it and I was so proud, and relieved, as I realized that all my hard work was finally paying off. I had to remain patient and never give up, and it was so rewarding to see all my efforts finally bear fruit.
