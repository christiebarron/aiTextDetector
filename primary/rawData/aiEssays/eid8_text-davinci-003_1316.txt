I had been struggling with my depression for months and I was having a hard time connecting with anyone, even the people I was closest too. My relationships had become so strained I was starting to think it was impossible to find friendship with anyone.

One day I was having a particularly bad day, I was feeling so low that I was close to tears. Then my best friend knocked on my door. She had noticed my mood and decided to come cheer me up. We had barely talked since winter break and I was surprised by her sudden visit.

At first, it was awkward and neither of us really knew what to say. We hadnâ€™t been that close for months and nothing seemed to feel right. Then my friend suddenly started making silly jokes, and before I knew it, we were both laughing so hard that it was hard to catch our breath.

The shared laughter was like a bridge between us. It dissolved the tension and suddenly we were friends again. That moment of laughter changed everything. I knew from that moment on our friendship was healed and I would never be alone or feel so low again
