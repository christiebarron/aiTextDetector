In Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus,” the narrator reflects on a special moment in her life — one of almost forgotten significance. As she looks upon the dying winter hibiscus flower, she is reminded of a time when she was about to take an important test. She is unsure about the results and chooses to reflect on the hibiscus flower instead, which is seen as a symbol of impermanence, hope and patience. 

The poem is set in the narrator's present, as the winter snows have started to fall and the geese have already begun to depart. The mourning of the winter hibiscus is reflective of her own state of mind as she hesitates to take the test. She knows that the hibiscus will not last, yet it brings her a moment of solace, an understanding to “let time tell,” and a reminder that all things must come to an end. 

The poem concludes with a statement of hope and determination. She believes that when the winter snows have melted and the geese have returned and the hibiscus is budding again — a symbol of the passing of a new season and the beginning of another — then she will take the test again. This ending in the poem implies that the narrator is able to appreciate the change of seasons and believes that a new season will bring a renewed energy and strength for her to take on the test. 

In a way, “Winter Hibiscus” is an exploration of the narrator’s personal dilemma
