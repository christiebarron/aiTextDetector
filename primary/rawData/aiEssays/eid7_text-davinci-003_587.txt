I was helping my neighbor tend to her garden recently when we noticed that the weeds were not coming out of the ground. She had already been working for quite a while and started to get frustrated and discouraged. I could tell she was on the verge of giving up and I wanted to help her out. I knew that I had to stay patient if I was going to be able to help her.

I asked her to take a break and we went inside to get a drink. She was still looking a bit exasperated, so I decided to take the lead. I explained that the weeds were probably really deep down and might take time to come out. I offered to stay and help her, if she just took the time to rest.

After a few minutes of rest and a glass of water, my neighbor was feeling much better. We went back outside and worked for a few hours, slowly digging, pulling, and clearing out the weeds one by one. After a few hours of work, her garden was weed-free and looked beautiful. 

It was clear to me that she was really appreciative of my help, and I was glad that I was able to stay patient and help out in the end. It was a great reminder that sometimes the best course of action is to take things slowly and be patient.
