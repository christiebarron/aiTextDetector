I was having a really tough day today. I had a lot on my mind and could practically feel the stress levels in my body rising. I was on the bus when I noticed a couple of kids causing a ruckus. They were pushing each other, yelling, and not paying attention to where they were going. At first, I was a bit irritated by their lack of respect and consideration for the people around them. 

But then, I remembered that children of all ages can behave this way at certain points in their lives. Instead of getting angry, I chose to be understanding and tolerant. So I just smiled at them and told them to take a seat and be a bit quieter. Surprisingly enough, they listened and sat down without any more fuss.

I'm really glad I was able to take the high road and remain patient instead of getting angry. It probably made all the difference in that situation and made the bus ride a bit more peaceful!
