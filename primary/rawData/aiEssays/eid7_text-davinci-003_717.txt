I was at a restaurant recently when I noticed that my friend's order was taking a long time to arrive. We had already been there for nearly an hour. My friend was getting increasingly frustrated, but I chose to stay patient.

I said to him that things can get busy at a restaurant and it's okay if it takes a bit longer than usual. I could tell he was trying to stay composed and not let his emotions run the show. So, I kept calming him down while we waited and eventually his meal arrived.

I think this was a good example of staying patient in a less-than-ideal situation. Even though I was getting frustrated too, I was able to take a deep breath and remember that this was out of our control. In the end, my patience paid off and my friend had his meal without completely losing it.
