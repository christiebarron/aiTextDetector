I remember the first time I met her. It was at a friend's party and we got to talking. We started to talk about the usual things, like what we did for work, our hobbies, and interests. But there was something intangible that I got from her that I instantly liked.

It was her contagious laughter. We started to laugh at every little thing, no matter how small or insignificant. Even when we ran out of things to talk about and conversation seemed to die, her laughter kept us going.

It's funny because I felt like I knew her for a long time after that initial meeting. I felt an instant connection and it was because of the laughter we shared. We didn't even need words.

We continued to be friends over the years and many of our memories are built on funny little moments, complete with laughter. We laugh about funny memories, gifs, puns, stories, and more.

Whether it's something funny during a night out, or something silly during a night in playing board games, our laughter has become a constant theme in our friendship and I wouldn't have it any other way. Laughter has certainly been the shortest distance between us.
