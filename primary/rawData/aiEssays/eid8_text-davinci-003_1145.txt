I was out at dinner with my friends and it was one of those dinners that seemed so serious being filled with plenty of scholarly conversations. Everyone around the table was discussing the issues of the world and the culture we lived in. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed and out of sorts with the intensity of the conversations and couldn’t find any way to join in until I heard something that I found really hilarious. One of my friends had said something about the economy that was completely absurd—so absurd that I couldn’t help laughing aloud. 

At first, everyone around the table seemed a bit startled by my noise and some of them even gave me a few glares. But man, when I got started, I couldn’t stop! I was laughing so hard that before I knew it everyone around the table was laughing with me. Once everyone else let the laughter erupt, the whole mood changed. We started to laugh together, talk and joke, and everyone felt more at ease. 

The laughter in that moment was pure magic. It felt like it connected us all. Bonded us together in a way that we hadn’t been connected before. We got to enjoy each other’s company and be ourselves in a way that was so simple and beautiful. I’ll always remember that dinner, and the wonderful feeling of connection we all experienced.
