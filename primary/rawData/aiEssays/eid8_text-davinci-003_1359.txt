I remember it like it was yesterday. It was my seventh birthday party, and all my friends were gathered at my house for games and cake. After a few rounds of pass the parcel and pin the tail on the donkey, we played a game of Simon Says. The commands were hard and all the kids were scared of getting it wrong. We were all shouted out with "Simon says jump" and then laughter erupted from everyone at the sight of all the kids jumping.

It felt so freeing and joyful - I had never heard so much laughter in one place before! We continued to play the game for a few more rounds, each time laughing louder and louder. I was so content in the moment and knew I would never forget it. 

Even today, whenever I think back to my seventh birthday and the game we played, I still hear the same laughter ringing in my ears. It reminds me of how laughter can bring people together in the most amazing ways.
