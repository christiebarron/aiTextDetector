The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez is an incredibly powerful piece of work, filled with deep emotion and a sense of nostalgia.

From the very beginning of the memoir, Rodriguez sets the tone of the work with a vivid description of his home and time spent with his family in New Jersey. He speaks about his childhood through the lens of nostalgia and joy, reflecting on all that his home has given him. His family's ancestral home, its deep history and values, embodied in a patchwork of memories, reminds us of the breadth of human experience and resilience.

The memoir deeply conveys how Rodriguez's home has defined who he is and how deeply connected he holds onto his memories. He speaks of providing new memories to his own family and of the comfort in his own home. Even when he moves away from his hometown, Rodriguez feels he can never really forget or turn away from it, because it is always a part of himself.

The mood created by Rodriguez through this writing is that of a deep love and reverence for his home, family and culture. He shows us how, despite the trials and changes faced, a home will always remain the same. This mood of peace, comfort and love provides an emotional context that is felt throughout this work. Even when his family face difficult moments and tragedies, they find solace in each other. Ultimately, Rodriguez’s work carries an important message of hope and connection.
