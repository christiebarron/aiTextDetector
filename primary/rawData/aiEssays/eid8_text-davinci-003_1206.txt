I remember that day so clearly. It was my first date with the man who would soon become my husband. We had decided to meet up in a café downtown to get to know each other a bit better. 

At first, we were both a bit nervous and quiet. We fumbled for something to say to ease the awkwardness, but neither of us could think of anything. Until he suddenly started telling me a joke—it was so silly and outrageous that I couldn't help but laugh. The laughter broke the ice and opened up the conversation. 

We spent the rest of the date laughing and talking together. We talked about our favorite movies, our family and friends, and our hopes and dreams for the future. We laughed and joked about things that only the two of us knew. We were so comfortably relaxed with each other and the conversation flowed easily. 

When we parted ways, we hugged and he said to me with a smile, "Finally, I met someone who can laugh with me the way I do."

Little did I know then, but the laughter would stay with us across the years and eventually become the cornerstone of our relationship.
