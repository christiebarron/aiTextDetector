I remember when I was in high school, my best friend and I used to share anything and everything with one another. One day, we had a good laugh when I told him that I had decided to dye my hair purple. He reacted with shock and asked why I would take such bold steps. We laughed so much that day, because we both knew that I was the type of person who usually follows the status quo and was scared of taking risks. 

We were reminded of our laughter-filled moment when a few days later, I passed by him with my newly-dyed purple hair. He stopped me immediately, beaming with delight and started laughing. We started goofing around, teasing one another about our respective styles, and I was glad that we had a good laugh together.

It felt so good to be able to laugh together like we used to at our shared memories and silly moments. Every so often, we'd remember our purple hair moment and it would bring us even closer, in knowing how unique our bond was. 

Laughter is not just something that helps us to lighten a moment - it's something that helps us to have a deeper connection with the people we care about and helps us to build a bridge between two people.
