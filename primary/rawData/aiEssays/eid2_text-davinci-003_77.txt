Censorship in libraries should not be tolerated. Libraries serve many purposes, such as providing an educational resource, preserving cultural and historical information, and offering a safe space for ideas to be expressed and discussed. If materials are removed from the shelves because they are considered offensive, not only is the right to free speech violated, but the library’s essential intent is hindered. 

The task of a librarian is to offer a variety of resources for people to gain knowledge and form their own opinion on topics. There is a certain amount of trust that the library is a safe haven for open discussion, without silencing certain materials. By censoring materials, the library is reshaping what is available for readers to access. Not allowing materials that may be considered offensive is censoring — plain and simple.

People should be allowed to determine for themselves whether certain materials are offensive to them without the library gatekeeping. While it is understandable that libraries would want to keep out materials deemed inappropriate, they should not be silencing voices.

In situations where a customer finds the material in the library offensive, they can choose to stay away from it. Everyone should have the right to free speech, even if it can be deemed as offensive. No one should be told what to think or how to feel. 

The primary task of a library is to provide a safe and welcoming space for ideas to be shared and discussed. Libraries should be a bastion of free speech and should never be used as a tool for censorship. Censorship in libraries should not be tolerated.
