I'll never forget the first time I heard my partner laugh. We'd been on a couple of dates and were getting to know each other, but there hadn't been much conversation. Then, out of nowhere, he started laughing. I was completely taken aback and stopped speaking, unsure of what had caused the outburst. After a few moments, he explained that he had been telling me a story and had stumbled upon something incredibly humorous in the telling.

I was so relieved that he knew how to laugh. In that moment, my anxieties melted away and I began to see the person he really was. We ended up talking for hours, both of us laughing and sharing stories. It was the most authentic conversation I'd ever experienced, and from then on, laughter was always an essential part of our relationship.

To this day, even after five years, all it takes is one shared joke, and it's like we're back at the beginning, laughing and learning about each other, and it makes my heart swell.
