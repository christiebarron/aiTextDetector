I remember the day I had my first date with my now husband as if it were yesterday. We had agreed to meet at a quaint cafe in the city and I was incredibly nervous. When I walked in, I found him sitting at one of the small tables in the corner. I was totally taken aback by how handsome he was and I remember trying not to stare. 

As soon as he saw me, his mouth curled up into a beautiful smile and it was as if a wave of calmness washed over me. We made small talk throughout dinner, each one of us more nervous than the other, endearing but unable to get the perfect words out.

After a while, I felt a mischievous thought come over me and I decided to do something outrageous. I started deliberately mispronouncing words that he kept using in the conversation, just to make him laugh. The plan worked and before I knew it, we were both laughing uncontrollably. 

That moment of laughter connected us on a deeper level and I knew without a doubt that I wanted to be with this beautiful, kind-hearted man for the rest of my life. Weâ€™ve been married for five years now and laughter still plays an essential role in our relationship.
