I had recently been put in charge of planning a surprise birthday party for my best friend, and I was determined to make it special. The party was in two weeks and I had yet to decide on a venue or food. I was getting overwhelmed by the task, and my friend's birthday was quickly approaching. I was about to give up when my mom stepped in. 

She could tell how stressed out I was, but instead of taking control and making the decisions for me, she was surprisingly patient. She reminded me to take a step back and calmly asked questions to help assess my options. I realized a lot of my worry was rooted in impatience. I was trying to plan the entire event in two days, when what I really needed was to be patient and work slowly and methodically. 

With my momâ€™s encouragement and input, I was able to take a breath and plan accordingly. We chose a venue and menu, made decorations, and happily surprised my friend with the epic party they deserved. Patience was key to making the party come together successfully.
