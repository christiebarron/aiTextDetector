In recent years, much debate has been had over the issue of censorship in libraries. Some argue that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves due to their being considered offensive by some, but this should not be the case. Libraries should uphold the purpose of providing diverse information and sources that cater to every reader and, consequently, should not partake in the act of censorship.

Libraries serve a educational purpose by allowing their patrons to access an array of sources and genres from which to draw their own conclusions. Censoring material from library shelves would be denying readers access to key knowledge and would impede their opportunity to explore the many facets of the world in which we live. While these materials may be deemed inappropriate, one could even argue that readers need to be exposed to both sides of an issue and can additionally use their discretion to make the decision of which materials they choose to engage with. 

Removing material from library shelves goes against the rules of a constitutionally regulated society. The First Amendment of the Constitution protects our right to free speech and expression. To impose censorship in libraries would be to violate these unique rights held by all citizens of the United States. 

Censorship in libraries would not only be a violation of our civil liberties but also a disservice to the overall integrity of libraries and their goal to be pillar for knowledge. In the case that a community disregards library resources, the absence of certain materials could equate to a ‘whitewashed’ version of history and culture, providing no semblance of the reality and injustice of times.
