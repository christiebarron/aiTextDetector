In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting plays a key role in the characterization of the main character, the cyclist. Through the rural, mountainous setting, readers experience the cyclist’s physical struggles. The cyclist is constantly pitted against the elements of nature as he makes his way through the woods and up the hills of the mountains. In addition, the characters in the story, Bus Driver and the two disabled children, all highlight the cyclist’s physical challenge. The cyclist is required to shove the bus up the mountain with Bus Driver, and he has to keep up with the two disabled children who are walking ahead of him.

The cyclist has no choice but to press on, so despite his exhaustion from the ride up until this point, he manages to summon the strength to keep going. Furthermore, the cyclist’s challenge becomes greater when it is revealed that the bus runs on a flat tire—highlighting his perseverance even further. By the end of the story, the cyclist is overly tired and could not have possibly imagined what was to come.
