Censorship in libraries has been a hot-button issue for decades. With the emergence of political correctness, debate has focused on how library materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines, should be protected from potentially offensive content. While some may argue that libraries should be able to remove offensive materials from their shelves, I believe libraries should not engage in censorship. 

The primary purpose of libraries is to open up minds and encourage the free exchange of ideas â€“ including ideas that some may find offensive. Libraries provide a space in which those who disagree can have respectful and informative debates over challenging topics. Without this space, many individuals may be refrained from exploring controversial ideas and instead, buried in their own narrow views. 

Besides, who has the authority to decide which materials are considered offensive? This is a highly subjective question and depends largely on the interpretation of the person making the decision. We may find teaching materials that differ in opinion to our own world views, but that does not make them offensive or inappropriate. Without an open exchange of ideas, our society will struggle to progress in the right direction. 

Additionally, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects Americans from censorship. Libraries known as a place of refuge, a repository of knowledge, should honor and uphold these rights. Censoring books and other materials without carefully picking through them is a violation of the idea of freedom of expression and thought.

Censoring library materials is not only unnecessary but also inappropriate. If someone finds certain materials offensive, they are free to express their opinion and choose not to read or watch whatever it
