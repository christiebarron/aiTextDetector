The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing for dirigibles to dock there. The process of allowing dirigibles to dock was made much more difficult because the building was initially designed for the purpose of being an office building, and the addition of a docking facility for dirigibles was not included in the original plans. As it is not a normal requirement for an office building, the engineers had to look for creative solutions in order to create such a system.

The main obstacle that the engineers faced was the difficulty in locating a suitable mooring mast. The mooring mast is essential for an airship to safely dock and be held in place while being moored, and it is remote and requires a lot of space to accommodate a dirigible. In the case of the Empire State Building, a mast could not simply be added onto the existing design. The building was too tall, and it did not have the required width to offer the necessary space for airships to safely dock.

Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, ‘The Mooring Mast’, provides an in-depth look at the process of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The engineers used a number of creative solutions to make the docking facility a reality. One such solution was the addition of a section at the top of the building, called the ‘air dock’. The air dock was designed to provide a place for dirigibles to land, which allowed for less airships to fly around the building looking for a place to dock.
