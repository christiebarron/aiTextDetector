So it is only logical that freedom of access to a wide range of materials should exist in this spaceâ€”without fear of censorship. This includes literature, music, movies and magazines that may be deemed by some people to be offensive or objectionable. 

If libraries are to remain places of true knowledge, then censorship of materials should be considered a very serious matter. Censoring materials deprives society and the individual of diverse forms of expression, such as those found in books, music, movies and magazines. Not only is this a form of censorship, but it also infringes upon our rights as citizens. 

Furthermore, libraries are a place to expose ourselves to new ideas and expand our perspectives. Censoring certain materials may deprive people of the opportunity to form their own opinions on certain topics. This can be especially damaging as it limits our critical thinking and prevents us from forming our own conclusions. 

Individuals have the right to choose what they read, watch, and think. It is not the role of libraries or their staff to be censors. Libraries should instead provide us with multiple points of view, regardless of how some people may feel about certain materials. Furthermore, those who feel uncomfortable with certain materials should be given the option to read or watch alternative materials, instead of being deprived of access to all of them.
