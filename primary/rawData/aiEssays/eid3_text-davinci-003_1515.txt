The setting of Joe Kurmaskiâ€™s 'Rough Road Ahead' greatly impacts the protagonist, the cyclist. Foremost, the description of the rough road the cyclist is faced with puts them immediately in danger. The road is littered with potholes and sharp stones, making for a hazardous journey and suggesting the cyclist is ill-equipped for the terrain.

The weather also affects the cyclist's journey, with a cold mist that curtails visibility and makes controlling the bike more difficult. Adding to the tension, an oppressive darkness and the flood of headlights from the cars that pass by give the cyclist a sense of vulnerability.

The cyclist is also forced to battle the elements to maneuver their way up a steep hill. The light rain turning to snow suggests that the hill is icy, adding to the difficulty of the task. The cold and isolation evoke emotional intensity as the cyclist struggles both mentally and physically with the climb. 

The cyclist's individual journey itself is heavily informed by the setting. The cyclist must strive to overcome the treacherous terrain through sheer strength and determination. There is a sense of persistence in the pursuit and hardships of the journey; the cyclist must brave each obstacle, fighting the elements to reach the top.
