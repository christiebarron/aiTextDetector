I recently went on a hiking trip with my friends. The trails were difficult and the weather was not too cooperative either. We got lost in the woods and had to walk for a few hours to get back to the spot we started at. It was dark, cold, and wet, but my friends and I stayed calm and did our best to find our way back.

The funny thing was that none of us were experienced hikers and it showed. We made a few mistakes here and there and ended up getting lost a few times. My friends and I couldâ€™ve easily gotten irritated and frustrated, but we chose to stay patient with each other and stay positive. 

During those difficult moments, I felt especially proud of my friends for retaining the patience and optimism that we had. In the end, all of our hard work paid off and we were able to get back on track and make it back to the car safely. 

Although it was a difficult situation, I was grateful that we all kept our cool, kept our spirits up, and relied on each other to get through it. Patience truly is a virtue and that day I learned the importance of being understanding and tolerant.
