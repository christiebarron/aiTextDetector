I was on a train ride back home from work when I suddenly heard a deep rumble from the seat across from mine. It was coming from an older man who had been reading a newspaper. I couldn’t help but smile as I noticed his laughter growing louder and more infectious with each passing second.

As I tried to hide my smile, I noticed the man had turned to me and caught me staring. I quickly apologized and he chuckled again, beckoning me closer with his hand. 

“I was just reading the funniest story,” he said, gesturing to the paper in his lap. “I could hardly believe it.”

He began to tell me the story and at first I was quite puzzled. Then, as he got further into the story, I found myself laughing harder and harder until my sides hurt. I think it was the older man’s contagious enthusiasm that did it.

When he finished, we both just smiled and sat quietly for a few moments, sharing in the lightness of that moment. I thanked him for his warmth and emotion, and he thanked me for laughing. We said our goodbyes as my stop came up, and I got off with a strange feeling of connection despite our exchange being a brief one.

I realized then that laughter can bring two people together, no matter how far apart they are.
