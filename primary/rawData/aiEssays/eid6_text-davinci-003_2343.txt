When the Empire State Building was constructed, the builders had to consider a unique challenge: the plan to accommodate dirigible docking. Despite having to overcome insurmountable engineering and structural challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building managed to develop a docking system that has stood the test of time.

The first challenge builders faced was constructing a suitable mast, which had to be made of an alloy steel strong enough to support a dirigible. The mast itself was to rise 863 feet in the air, and it had to be thick enough to keep from swaying in the wind. The mast would also need to be designed for easy access for mooring, which proved to be no easy task. Designers had to study the structural needs of a dirigible as well as the physical atmosphere around the mast, and make sure the two were in harmony.

In addition to constructing a mechanically sound mast, the builders had to ensure that its bottom half could function as a large wind sail, allowing a dirigible to pick up wind power and sail its way to the Empire State Buildingâ€™s mooring mast. To achieve this the lower half of the mast was made of a lightweight membrane filled with air. This helped the dirigible ascent to a specified level, where ropes and guides were provided to secure its descent.

Finally, the builders had to consider the powered inflation systems needed to buoy the mast in the air. It was determined that helium gas would be required, allowing the mooring system to float above the standard wind speed at the Empire State Building. Several rotary fans were strategically placed to direct the
