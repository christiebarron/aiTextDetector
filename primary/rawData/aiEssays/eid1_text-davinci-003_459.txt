Dear Editor:

As people are becoming more reliant on computers, I believe that it is essential to pause and reflect on the impact these devices have on us. 

On one hand, computers have opened up countless opportunities for us, allowing us to grow our knowledge, stay connected to friends, and stay active with hobbies like online gaming. On the other hand, computers have created issues, such as increased isolation, elevated stress levels, and the growth of cyber-bullying.

We should all be aware of the effects computers have on our minds and happiness level. We need to be careful with how much time weâ€™re spending in front of our screens, and make sure to take breaks and spend time outside, with friends and family. The right balance of technology and socializing is key to our mental, emotional, and physical well-being.

Parents especially need to be vigilant to ensure that their children have the resources and guidance to navigate the ever-changing digital world safely.

I encourage everyone to take a step back, set some hard boundaries on technology, and make sure that the computers are only adding to our lives, not taking away from them.

Sincerely,

[Name]
