Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski examines the struggles and experiences of an anonymous cyclist as he braves the elements of a rough road. In this piece, the cyclist navigates rocky terrain, gusty winds and a steep grade- all characteristics of the setting that directly affect their bicycling experience.

The rocky terrain of the road creates a challenge for the cyclist as the bike tires struggle to maintain traction. This leads to a need for increased concentration and effort from the cyclist, who needs to stay alert and listen to the feedback from the bicycle and the road in order to make adjustments to their course and speed.

The strong gusts of wind along the route are described as “cruelly blowing”, signifying a challenge to face and conquer. The cyclist must use all their resources and struggle against the wind in order to make progress. Slow uphill patches caused by the steep grade of the terrain challenge the cyclist’s endurance, taking away their momentum and making it difficult to maintain their speed.

The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead directly influence the cyclist’s experiences. In this instance, the cyclist has no choice but to press on and overcome the difficult terrain and winds.
