One summer afternoon, my friends and I decided to go for a spontaneous picnic. We were a bit reckless and grabbed some food from our kitchen and took a bus out into the countryside. As we set up our blankets and spread out our food, I couldn't help but laugh at the way my friends embraced the silliness of the situation. 

We started discussing all sorts of strange topics, which made us laugh harder and harder. We fed the birds, ran around in circles and chased each other like mad. Even though we were sweaty and covered in grass, I felt a special bond between us, because laughter was the glue that held us together. 

That picnic is now one of my favorite memories, because we managed to find joy and connection amidst the craziness. Laughter was the bridge that allowed us to feel connected to each other, knowing that we would share that moment forever.
