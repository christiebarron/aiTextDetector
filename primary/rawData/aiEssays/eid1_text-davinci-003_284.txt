Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the effects of computers on people in todayâ€™s society. Since the invention of the personal computer, our lives have been drastically transformed.

The presence of computers in our lives has both positive and negative effects. On one hand, computers are essential tools in a variety of industries, allowing us to stay connected to and informed of world events. Computers also enable us to access a wide variety of resources that would be difficult to find otherwise. Additionally, computers have improved the ability of people to collaborate and communicate more effectively regardless of distance.

On the other hand, computers can become a pervasive and addictive presence in our lives. Heavy use of computers can lead to feelings of isolation and a lack of real-world social opportunities. In addition, constant computer use can lead to sleep problems, eye strain, and an overall decline in physical activity.

Although computers have brought about some negative influences, we can take advantage of the technology in order to produce positive outcomes. With responsible use, computers can open up exciting new opportunities and foster better connections between people. As our lives increasingly become intertwined with technology, it is important to keep track of our habits in order to ensure the benefits are not outweighed by the risks.

I hope that through my letter readers will take into consideration the effects computers are having on our lives and stay mindful of their usage. 

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
