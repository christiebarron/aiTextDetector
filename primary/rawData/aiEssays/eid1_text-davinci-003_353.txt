Dear Editor,

As technology progresses, computers are becoming increasingly important in our lives. While computers have made many tasks more efficient and convenient, some people worry about the adverse effects of computers on people. I disagree â€” I believe that computers have a number of positive effects on people.

First of all, computers help people stay connected to each other, even across long distances. People can video chat with friends, family, and colleagues, share photos, and even make new friends. Computers also provide access to a wealth of information, which makes research and writing much easier. Furthermore, computers can be used to create innovative and creative works, as well as play recreational games.

Moreover, computers can provide excellent job opportunities, as they are increasingly used in a number of industries. Remote working not only saves time, it can provide financial freedom and a sense of control simply not possible in traditional workplaces.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a lot of positive effects on people. They bring people together, provide access to valuable information, and offer job opportunities. I urge the readers of your newspaper to look at the advantages of computers, rather than focusing on the potential drawbacks.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
