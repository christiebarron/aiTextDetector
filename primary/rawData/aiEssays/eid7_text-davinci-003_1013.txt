I remember the time I was at the grocery store and the line was incredibly long, with people wrapping around the corner of the aisle. Everyone was getting antsy and people began making remarks about the length of the wait. I, however, was happy to wait my turn and stay patient, after all, I was in no particular rush.

I noticed an elderly couple at the front of the line, the woman was struggling to get her wallet out of her bag and her husband was standing by her side, patiently helping her. She eventually managed to get her wallet out, but then she couldn't find her card in her purse. The entire line was getting frustrated, but her husband just remained calm and continued supporting her.

After what seemed like an eternity, the couple eventually completed their payment and started to walk away with their grocery bags. As they passed me, I couldn't help but feel admiration for the husband's patience with his wife. He had been kind and understanding throughout the entire thing, and his patience had rubbed off on me. It was truly a remarkable thing to witness.
