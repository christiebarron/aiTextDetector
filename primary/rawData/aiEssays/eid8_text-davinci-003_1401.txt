My aunt and I had always had a special bond. Whenever I went to visit her, we would spend the entire afternoon laughing and sharing stories.

One particular afternoon, I decided to surprise her with a puppet show that I had created. The show was full of silly jokes, lots of noises, and even a few song and dance routines. I thought it was hilarious, and couldn't wait to share it with her.

Naturally, when I started to perform, my aunt was surprised. But whatever embarrassment I felt soon melted away when I saw the look on her face. She was laughing hysterically and almost couldn't keep it together.

We laughed for what felt like hours. In that moment, everything else seemed to fade away and all that mattered was the two of us. I felt so loved and cherished in that moment, which I'll never forget. I'm so thankful for laughter, and especially for the laughter I share with my aunt.
