Dear Editor:

As technology advances each day, computers are becoming increasingly integrated into our lives. While computers offer countless opportunities for improved communication and convenience, I'm growing increasingly aware of the damaging effects this technology can have on people.

More and more, people are being isolated in their own homes due to the convenience of the internet. Through modern communication tools, including social media and apps, humans can now connect from around the world, yet due to the convenience afforded us by technology, many of us donâ€™t venture outside our homes to socialize in person. Computer screens separate us from real interactions, while still providing us with the feeling of companionship.

Additionally, computers can have negative psychological effects on people. We often become overwhelmed with too much information, and the constant updates, news, emails, and more can impair concentration, causing an inability to focus on one task, leading to burnout and exhaustion.

Finally, computer use can have physical health implications. Staring at a screen can lead to eye strain, headaches, and neck and back pain due to poor posture. Computer use can also lead to less exercise because people choose activities that can be done on a computer instead of going for a jog.

In conclusion, computers can be a great tool for personal and professional convenience, but can also have negative effects on people's physical and mental health. Therefore, it is important to remember that too much use of computers can detract from our quality
