The ending line of Minfong Ho's poem “Winter Hibiscus” serves to emphasize the theme of perseverance and hope that is prevalent throughout the poem. In the poem, the persona speaks to their own confidence when it comes to one day succeeding in a seemingly daunting task, the comparison often being that of a winter hibiscus that perseveres and buds despite the snow. This theme of perseverance is best seen in lines such as “Pupils that hardened like petals in the winter,” and it’s this insight that leads to the closing line. 

When the persona says “Then I will take that test again,” they are speaking to the idea that they will one day be well equipped to meet the challenge they face. That, regardless of any obstacles, they have faith and determination in their own abilities to grow, to overcome, and to succeed. This idea of resilience and hope is best seen in the persona's willingness to not just “wait for the spring”, but to “return in the spring”, prepared togrow and to conquer whatever obstacle it may be that they face. 

This powerful message of pouring yourself into the present and taking strength in the future is made evident throughout the poem. From the “deep rooted love” that the hibiscus has for life, to the “patient hush” of the snow as it a waits for warmer days, the poem speaks to the idea that with enough hard work, perseverance, and dedication, one can blossom
