I recently visited my grandparents in a neighboring town. My grandmother is a very active woman and loves nothing more than planning excursions and activities during a visit. This time, my grandparents had decided to take us to a local nature reserve to explore the trails and visit the local museum.

While my brother and I were excited, we had no idea what to expect. My grandmother told us the drive would be an hour long, so I prepared myself for a long and boring ride.

Surprisingly, my grandmother was patient the entire way, taking our constant questions and comments without complaining. She even allowed us to get out of the car at a few points to admire the local scenery. She was also patient when we arrived at the nature reserve and took us on a walking tour, explaining the local flora and fauna.

By the end of the trip, my brother and I were left in awe of both the beauty of the nature reserve and the patience of my grandmother. We thanked her for being so patient with us, and I'm sure this won't be the last trip we take with her.
