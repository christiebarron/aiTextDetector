I had just been hired as a receptionist at a busy hotel and was excited to start working in my new role. On my first day, I quickly realized how many customers I had to serve and how complicated the job could be. The manager had warned me that it would take a few days for me to get used to the system and I was certainly feeling overwhelmed.

However, one of the other employees, a middle-aged woman named Margie, noticed my struggle and took the time to show me exactly how the process worked. She did not move on to the next task until I was certain I understood what she was saying. I was grateful and thanked her for her patience.

Margie did not stop there. Whenever I struggled with certain tasks, she took the time to go through them with me and made sure that I was comfortable with my duties. She was understanding and never once showed any frustration when I was slow or made mistakes. After a week or so, I was close to a pro and extremely grateful for her help.

Thanks to Margieâ€™s patience, I got to grips with the job quickly and was able to handle it confidently. To this day, she is one of my biggest mentors and someone who I will always be in debt to.
