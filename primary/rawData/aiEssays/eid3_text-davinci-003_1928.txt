The setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a direct effect on the cyclist's experience. The solitude of the rural landscape serves to put her in a meditative state, allowing her to think more deeply on her journey ahead. This serenity also serves to heighten the intense physical effort and strain she is undertaking, as well as her ability to appreciate the nuances of nature around her. The loneliness of the wide-open rural roads also adds a layer of fear and vulnerability to her expedition. The cyclist is acutely aware of the lack of friendly faces around her and the lack of tangible resources should something go wrong. Despite this feeling of vulnerability, the cyclist finds comfort in the natural beauty and serenity of the setting. 

The rolling hills of the countryside challenge the cyclist both physically and mentally, serving as a reminder of how much effort must be exerted to move forward and achieve her goals. Simultaneously, the undulating hills and winding dirt paths offer her a sense of freedom as she is allowed to move as freely as she wishes down the path less traveled. The silent beauty of nature also serves as a major source of motivation for the cyclist; giving her the inspiration to keep going
