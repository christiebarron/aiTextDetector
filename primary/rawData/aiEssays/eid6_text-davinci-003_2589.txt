Given their immense size and diversity of form, dirigibles are impressive aerial vessels. Like their fixed-wing counterparts, dirigibles have played a central role in human transportation. Such was the case in the 1930s, when dirigibles began to dock at the Empire State Building. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle involved familiarity with dirigibles. Prior to the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building, few of the architects and engineers were familiar with the large vessels. This was an important factor in determining how the structure of the building and its rooftop infrastructure were designed. In order to properly accommodate dirigibles, detailed drawings and construction plans had to be created in order to ensure the building would provide a safe port for mooring.

The second obstacle was the logistics of providing mooring systems for dirigibles. Dirigibles had to be securely tied in order to reduce drift and ensure safety for passengers and crew. To accommodate the strong winds that often accompany dirigiblesâ€™ approach, the mooring mast have to have been designed to withstand tension and torque in both horizontal and vertical directions. This meant that each mast had to be reinforced and made from the most durable materials available. 

The third obstacle was designing a system that would provide an electrical power supply for dirigibles. The power system for dirigibles was a crucial component of their operations. To ensure reliable electrical power, the Empire State Building engineers had to design a power system that ran through
