I recently experienced a situation where I was required to be very patient. I was waiting in the bedroom for my partner, who had just finished a 48-hour work shift. While he was sleeping, I had the urge to go through his phone to check something I had seen on the news. However, I knew this would cause a fight, so instead I took a deep breath and tried to be as patient with him as I could.

The next thing I knew, I started cooking lunch for him instead. By the time he walked into the kitchen, I had already cooked up a hearty meal for him. I couldn't help but smile when I heard the surprise in his voice as he asked me how long I had been awake. 

I could tell he was exhausted, but he still took the time to listen to me as I explained the situation. He even took the initiative to explain to me why it would be better to wait and talk to him about it later; something I had failed to take into consideration.

It felt surprisingly good to be patient. I knew that it showed that I cared about him and was willing to put his needs above mine. In the end, I was glad that I had waited instead of barging into the situation. Being patient was worth it.
