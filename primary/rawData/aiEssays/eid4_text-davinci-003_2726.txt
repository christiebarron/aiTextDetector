Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” is a poignant tale of a young girl facing the abstract concept of time, tested in the entrance exam to a prestigious school. The winter hibiscus is symbolic of her determination and refusal to give up despite the odds being stacked against her. The poem ends with the words: “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?”

The poem's ending symbolizes both the resilience of nature and the narrator's courage. Just as the resilient hibiscus blooms in the ultimate adversity of winter, despite the odds stacked against her, the narrator shows unfaltering resilience in her decision to take the entrance exam for the prestigious school again. The returning geese symbolize the continual cycle of life, giving the poem an uplifting theme of hope and courage. This serves to highlight the courage and strength the narrator finds within her. 

The winter hibiscus serves to encourage the narrator to stay the course and persevere in her chosen path. Its enduring beauty in the face of harsh winter weather is symbolic of the hope and determination that resides in all of us. Through the analogy of the hibiscus and the returning birds, Minfong Ho paints a convincing picture of resilience in the face of adversity. 

Ultimately, the poem serves to remind us of our own determination and courage and encourages us to keep striving even when the odds seem to be against us. Encouraging
