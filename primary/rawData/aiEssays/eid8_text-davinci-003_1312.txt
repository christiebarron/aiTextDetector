I remember it like it was yesterday. My friend and I were walking down the street, bursting with laughter. We had just seen a funny movie and were reenacting some of the key scenes. I can still hear our joyful laughter ringing out through the street.

Suddenly, we noticed an elderly man sitting on a bench nearby. Our laughter caught his attention and he started to smile. His eyes lit up and I knew he was ready to get in on the fun.

My friend and I motioned for the man to come to us and he obliged. We introduced ourselves and the first joke of the evening fell flat. We couldn't quite tell if the man was about to back away when my friend brought out an old photograph.

It was a photograph of the man when he was a younger man. As soon as my friend showed him the picture, the man's face lit up. He let out a deep, throaty chuckle and suddenly, we all found ourselves in a fit of laughter.

We told more jokes, swapped stories, and enjoyed each other's company. We were like old friends despite having just met. I still think about the conversation often, and remember that sweet moment of laughter that brought us together.
