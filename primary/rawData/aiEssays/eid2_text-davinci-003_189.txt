The world today is increasingly becoming more liberal and open-minded; however, this does not mean that freely available resources, such as libraries, should be overrun by immoral material. It is essential to maintain the integrity and civility of libraries by censorship and ensuring the material made available is appropriate for all. 

Books, music, movies, and magazines commonly found in libraries should not contain nonsensical, sexually explicit, or violent content. Such materials can have a detrimental effect on the younger generation, making access to this material via libraries a highly volatile issue. Inappropriate material should not be made available as part of the library collection, nor should it be given a platform to influence readers’ opinions and beliefs. 

Unfortunately, anti-censorship advocates continue to defend material that has no educational or moral value, levying content inappropriate for library shelves. This can be confusing for the reader, and particularly for those who are not well-educated about the subject. As such, it is both imposing and dangerous if these materials are left unchecked by trusted institutions such as libraries. 

Although free speech is of utmost importance, it should always be balanced as part of a wider policy of ensuring user safety in our nation’s libraries. The free exchange of ideas should be encouraged and guided by content suitable for libraries. With this in mind, books, music, movies, and magazines should be screened for appropriate content and removed from the shelves if found offensive. Libraries provide us with a great platform for learning, and it is only right that we maintain its sanctity in the process.
