The idea of the Empire State Building allowing dirigibles to dock was an ambitious endeavor that faced several challenges. An estimaited 250,000 people attended the opening of the Empire State Building in May of 1931, marveling at the worldâ€™s tallest building. But among that audience, there were some who hoped the building could become something more: a place for dirigibles to safely dock. However, even though these dirigibles had existed since the late 1800s, allowing them to dock at the Empire State Building was no easy feat.

The first major obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the lack of a suitable infrastructure. Dirigibles were very large and powerful vehicles unlike any other form of transportation, and accommodating them required specially designed equipment. For the Empire State Building to accommodate a dirigible, it was necessary to construct a unit of mooring masts and cables on the top of the building. This unit was made of very tough steel, reaching more than 200 feet into the air, and required skilled workers to install in such a precarious location.

In addition to the infrastructure, existing safety protocols also posed an obstacle. As dirigibles were quite unstable, their pilots needed to follow thorough guidelines to ensure a safe docking experience. This meant providing the pilot with access to a mooring mechanism and keeping potential hazards, such as the high winds surrounding the Empire State Building, under control. The builders of the Empire State Building had to iron out the technical details of such protocol before dirigibles could even dock.

Other issues included ensuring the pilots had access to suitable navigation
