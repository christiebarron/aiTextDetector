The Empire State Building was not only an iconic monument during its time of construction, but an engineering marvel that literally shook the world in its wake. This incredible structure enabled the city of New York to have one of the first structures that allowed for dirigibles to dock. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to carefully consider the numerous obstacles that came with installing a mooring mast which allowed for dirigibles to dock.

One of the primary obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in installing a mooring mast was the incredibly high winds that surrounded the structure. Being located in New York City, the windstrength and velocity could reach extreme levels. Taking into account the fragile nature of the dirigibles, the designers and engineers had to develop a mooring mast that could withstand such levels of windforce. As a result, the mooring mast was designed with a shaft that was set have an incredibly low coefficient of wind drag, allowing it to remain flat and more aerodynamic even in high wind conditions.

Another major obstacle faced by the engineers of the Empire State Building was the physical size of the mooring mast. The mooring mast was to be erected atop the highest point of the Empire State Building and had to be tall enough to ensure that dirigibles could dock safely and securely. In order to meet this challenge, the mooring mast had to be of the highest quality, ensuring that it could resist corrosion from the various climatic conditions and tensions from the heavy mooring cable. It was also designed to be as lightweight as possible, so it
