I remember a time when I was at the grocery store with my mom. There was a long line at the checkout and we were stuck waiting for what seemed like an eternity. I could feel my patience wearing thin, but then I noticed how patient my mom was being.

She was slowly walking up and down the aisles, looking for small items we needed for dinner that night. She was taking her time, talking to people and making conversation with the other customers and the cashier. She was always smiling and making sure to thank everyone. 

Although I felt frustrated by the long line, I couldn't help but be impressed with my mom's patience. She never once complained or acted annoyed. It was a reminder of how important it is to remain understanding and tolerant in these situations.
