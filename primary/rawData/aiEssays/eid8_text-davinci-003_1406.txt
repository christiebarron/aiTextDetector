I was at the park throwing a baseball with my daughter when I suddenly heard laughter coming from across the park. We both looked over to see a mom and her son playing tag. The moment I heard their laughter I felt something in my heart click. It was a feeling of pure joy and contentment, and I hadn't felt like that in years. 

My daughter and I started aiming the baseball at each other, me pretending to be the pitcher while she tried her best to swing the bat. The silly faces we made each time she swung gave us both a good laugh. I noticed that the laughter coming from the woman and her son had started to die down, and I realized that we were encouraging each other to laugh more - her son was enjoying himself more with each passing second.

The high-pitched laughter that was ringing through the park now was infectious. Soon, the entire park seemed to be filled with different types of laughter. Everyone was partaking in some kind of game or activity, but it was as if everyone was in on the same joke, and everyone was eager to join in. 

My daughter and I continued playing until the sun began to set and the park was lit up with the warm glow of the sunset. We started walking back to our car, when I noticed that the the mom and her son were still playing tag - I smiled to myself, knowing that we had helped rekindle the laughter in their lives. As I watched them playing, I felt a warmth in my chest, and I knew that no distance was too far if laughter was involved.
