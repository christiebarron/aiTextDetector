The setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” plays a large role in highlighting the cyclist’s emotional journey. The setting establishes a grand, adventurous stage where the cyclist must summon strength, courage, and resilience in order to make it through the difficult terrain. The physical description of the environment, including the rocky hills and muddy roads, helps to convey a sense of challenge that is acutely felt by the cyclist.

Despite the challenges ahead, the cyclist is able to remain optimistic thanks to the inspiring environment that surrounds him.
