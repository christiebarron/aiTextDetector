The Empire State Building is a structure steeped in American history and renown. From the time it was initially proposed in 1929, there was a drive to make the building accommodate for the presence of dirigibles as much as possible. There were many obstacles that had to be overcome to create the mooring mast, many of which are described in Marcia Amidon Lüsted's book, The Mooring Mast. 

One of the main engineering issues that the mast presented was its potential to break free of the building, especially in dangerous weather conditions. This made it imperative that the mast be built in such a way that would stop it from moving around too much in windy conditions and thus keep dirigibles as safe as possible. One of the most difficult tasks that the engineers encountered in this respect was finding a material that was light enough to fit the mast design but robust enough to withstand the forces that the wind and dirigible would exert on the building – a task which eventually was solved using a special alloy beam.

Another major obstacle that had to be tackled in the construction of the mast was the positioning of the 80-foot-tall spire. As the mast was made of multiple parts to allow for efficient packing and transportation, the diameter of the widest part at the mooring platform was nearly six feet. As such, the engineers had to find a way to secure the spire in place without disrupting the smooth airflow along the mast’s length. This was achieved using a combination of torque rods and pressure fittings along each section of the mast to ensure a smooth flow of air around the sp
