When I first met my future husband, I was nervous, but the moment he cracked a joke, I laughed and the tension melted away. We exchanged a few more witty banter and the rest of our conversation flowed easily. From then on, we would joke around together and laugh a lot.

Our first dates were filled with laughter. Our favorite thing to do is go to the comedy club and we would laugh until our sides hurt. Laughing was definitely a big part of our relationship.

Things got really serious when we had to make the decision to move in together. I told him that I wanted to make sure we always stayed happy and laughed together. He agreed and promised that he would always bring a smile to my face.

Fast forward a few years, and weâ€™re now happily married and still laughing together. I know that laughter is the key to a successful relationship, and I thank my lucky stars every day that we share it!
