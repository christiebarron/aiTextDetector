I remember the first time I met my new boyfriend, I was so nervous about making a good impression that I found myself oversharing about my hobbies and interests and telling exaggerated stories about my life. We were both trying to impress each other, to get the other person to like us. 

After a few minutes of awkward conversation, my boyfriend started telling me jokes, mostly about himself, but even those I had heard before made me laugh. We started going back and forth and before long, the whole atmosphere was filled with laughter.

It made me feel warm and cozy inside and I loved it. We both laughed until we had tears in our eyes and our stomachs ached. After that, I felt so much closer to him. In that moment, laughter connected us and it felt like we had been friends for a long time.

I later learned that laughter is an important part of a relationship and that it helps build a strong bond between two people. It's something I will never forget and it's something I remind myself of whenever I'm feeling down or nervous. Laughter is a beautiful thing and it will always have a special place in my heart.
