As a librarian, I am often asked about the need for censorship in libraries. My answer is this: Censorship has no place in libraries. 

Libraries are essential community resources, providing a wide variety of materials, services, and information to the public at large. They have the power to shape hearts, minds, and ideas. But such power can be stifled by censorship. The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech, a fundamental democratic principle. Censorship of books, movies, and other materials limits the ability of citizens to obtain knowledge and make informed decisions. 

When it comes to censoring material, librarians must play a delicate balancing act in order to maintain their commitment to promoting knowledge and diverse perspectives. It is important to recognize that freedom of expression can include a wide range of ideas, values, and expressions that some people may find offensive. A library's mission is to provide resources and access to a variety of opinions and ideas, so it is counter-productive to censor material in the name of protecting people's feelings. 

It is also important to recognize the subjectivity of censorship. What one person considers offensive may be viewed as perfectly acceptable by another person. When librarians censor material, they enter into a realm of arbitrariness and personal taste which does a disservice to the library.

Ultimately, censorship in libraries is a slippery slope that should be avoided altogether. Librarians should be advocates for open access to information, not gatekeepers of acceptable ideas or topics. Censorship limits intellectual freedom and negatively impacts our library collections
