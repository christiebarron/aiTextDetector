I remember the first time I ever laughed with my boyfriend. We had been dating for a couple of months, and everything was still new and a bit awkward. We had gone out to dinner and were walking back to his place afterwards. As we walked, we were looking at the stars and discussing some of the constellations we could make out. 

Out of nowhere, my boyfriend called out the name of one of the constellations – Pegasus – but instead of saying it exactly right, he ended up saying “Pegasusas.” I started to giggle as soon as he said it and he looked at me in surprise. Then, he smiled and started to laugh too. 

It was a beautiful moment because it was the first time we laughed together. Until that moment, it felt like we were still feeling each other out, and then all of a sudden, we were united in laughter. That moment marked the start of a strong and unbreakable bond between us.
