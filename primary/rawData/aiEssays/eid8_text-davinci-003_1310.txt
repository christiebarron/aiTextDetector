It had been a long day at work and I was looking forward to spending some time with my best friend. We hadn't seen each other in months, so I had been looking forward to it.

When I finally arrived at her place, I found her in the kitchen, making dinner. I noticed her eyes twinkling with mischief, and before I knew it, she was carefully setting up an elaborate practical joke.

It was all I could do to keep from laughing, but I was determined to play it cool. She finished giggling and asked me to come sit at the table. She said, "I've got a game for us to try!"

It was funny and we were both having a blast, but as my friend continued to spin her ridiculous scenarios, I kept getting the uncontrollable urge to laugh. I managed to keep it together for a few minutes, but then... we just burst out laughing.

Neither of us could control it and we just kept laughing until our sides hurt. Our laughter connected us in that moment and, for a brief second, I felt the genuine love and friendship between us in a way that I hadn't in months.

It was one of those perfect moments, and I will never forget it.
