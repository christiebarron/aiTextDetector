The Empire State Building was built during the Roaring Twenties—a time when airship travel, or dirigibles, was a rapidly growing industry. Inspired by the grandeur of the era, designers of the building wanted to make it accessible to dirigibles so that visitors could arrive in style. This presented a number of difficult engineering challenges, however, as the engineers had to solve the unique problem of safely docking these massive airships. 

One major challenge of allow dirigibles to dock was the shifting winds in the New York City area. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book The Mooring Mast, the fluctuating winds along with the skyscraper’s huge height made a reliable mooring point hard to find. At the time, the closest the engineers could come to a securely stable location was the roof of the 80th floor. However, this was still not ideal, as it was nearly 1,000 feet in the air, and passengers had to be taken up and down the building in a dedicated elevator. This created a difficult logistics problem, as it was not possible for the dirigibles to stop and loading passengers could take long time.

In addition, the team had to contend with weight limits. For the airship to successfully dock, it had to be able to fit in the mooring masts’ cradles, which in turn could safely accept a load of up to 50,000 pounds. Any heavier and the mooring mast structure could buckle if winds were strong enough. Fortunately, most airships of the time weighed
