In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is presented with a difficult, but rewarding journey. The setting is a prominent feature in the narrative that provides a challenging backdrop for the cyclist's journey.

The terrain of the early part of the cyclist's route is rural and hilly. The roads are winding and mostly unpaved, forcing her to ride at a slower pace. The surrounding countryside features a vast, unspoiled landscape, often without a guardrail to provide safety from a potential plunge off the road. These features combine to make a potential hazard for the cyclist, and require her to practice caution as she navigates.

As the cyclist continues on her route, she enters a more urban setting. The roads become better paved and the environment more heavily trafficked with cars and other cyclists. Despite these changes, the cyclist still has to be very aware of her surroundings and follow the rules of the road, as it can still be potentially dangerous. The cyclist begins to get comfortable with her form and speed, emphasizing the constant focus required throughout her journey.

The varying setting allows the cyclist to adjust to different obstacles as necessary. The cyclist must challenge herself and be aware of her environment
