I remember last month I went to my local bank to get some paperwork done. Unfortunately, each teller had a long line of people waiting and it seemed like it took forever to get to the front. Despite the long wait, I stayed in line, refusing the urge to cut. I stayed patient throughout the entire process and kept a peaceful, understanding demeanor. 

Eventually, I reached the front of the line and was able to finish the paperwork. Although it took a lot longer than expected, I was proud of myself for remaining patient and not giving in to any negative feelings. Through this experience, I realized the importance of staying patient, even when the situation seems difficult.
