Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson
Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were two of the most influential presidents in American history. Both men had very different backgrounds, personalities, and political ideologies, but they shared a common goal of making America a better place. In this essay, we will compare and contrast Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.
Theodore Roosevelt was born in 1858 in New York City. He was the son of a wealthy family and grew up with a love for nature and the outdoors. He attended Harvard University where he excelled academically and athletically. After college, he became involved in politics and eventually became the governor of New York before being elected as Vice President under William McKinley.
Woodrow Wilson was born in 1856 in Virginia. Unlike Roosevelt, he did not come from a wealthy family but rather grew up on a small farm. He attended Princeton University where he also excelled academically before going on to study law at the University of Virginia. After practicing law for several years, he became involved in politics and eventually became the governor of New Jersey before being elected as President.
One major difference between these two presidents was their political ideologies. Theodore Roosevelt was known as a progressive Republican who believed that government should play an active role in regulating business to protect consumers and workers. He also believed that America should be more involved in international affairs to promote democracy around the world.
On the other hand, Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat who believed that government should have limited involvement in business affairs but should play an active role in promoting social justice through programs like his New Freedom plan which aimed to break up monopolies and promote competition.
Another major difference between these two presidents was their approach to foreign policy. Theodore Roosevelt is perhaps best known for his “Big Stick” diplomacy which emphasized military strength as a means of projecting American power abroad. This approach led him to intervene militarily in places like Cuba, Panama, and Mexico during his presidency.
Woodrow Wilson, on the other hand, was a proponent of “moral diplomacy” which emphasized promoting democracy and human rights around the world. This approach led him to intervene militarily in places like Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico during his presidency.
Despite these differences, both presidents shared a common goal of making America a better place. Theodore Roosevelt is perhaps best known for his efforts to protect America’s natural resources through programs like the National Parks System and his support for conservationism. He also worked to improve working conditions for Americans through laws like the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act.
Woodrow Wilson is perhaps best known for his efforts to promote social justice through programs like his New Freedom plan which aimed to break up monopolies and promote competition. He also worked to improve working conditions for Americans through laws like the Clayton Antitrust Act which aimed to prevent unfair business practices.

His legacy can be seen today in programs like the National Parks System which he helped create.

In conclusion, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were two very different presidents with very different backgrounds, personalities, and political ideologies. However, they shared a common goal of making America a better place through their progressive policies aimed at protecting consumers, workers, and natural resources while promoting social justice and democracy around the world. Despite their differences, both men are remembered as some of America’s greatest leaders whose legacies continue to shape our country today.
