One of the best memories I have with my sister was a time we shared together laughing and joking as we waited on the train to come in and take us home. It was midsummer and the air was thick and hot, making it hard to stay focused for long. 

We were killing time, telling stories and tidbits about ourselves and each others lives, but making sure not to forget to have a few laughs along the way. It was the perfect balance of serious and silly, and the belly laughs and smirks we shared kept the heat at bay.

Our train finally came and we spilled inside, nearly tipping over from the surprise at its eventual arrival. We continued our laughter as we found seats and caught up on the huge amount of news that had gathered in the hours we had been apart. As we went deeper into the ride, I knew we were preserving a piece of ourselves between two passengers who were effectively sharing one single moment.

It's one of those memories that I cherish and will always remember, one filled with laughter and the refreshing feeling of being connected to someone else in the most intimate way. I know that without the laughter, our experience of that day and the train ride wouldn't have been nearly as incredible.
