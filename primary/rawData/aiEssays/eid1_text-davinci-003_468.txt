Dear [name of newspaper],

I'm writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In my mind, computers have had a largely positive impact on society, ushering in more efficient methods of communication and collaboration, opening doors to the workplace for people with disabilities, and providing access to a wide variety of information and entertainment.

That said, computers aren't, and shouldn't be, a substitute for human connection. Too often people become so immersed in their computer-driven lives that they miss out on the real world. Whether through neglecting physical activities or spending too much time playing video games, excessive computer use can have serious physical and mental health implications.

Therefore, I believe it is important to strike a balance between using computers as a helpful tool and finding ways to break away and appreciate the world around us. By introducing daily activities such as walking, swimming, or simply chatting with a neighbor, we can find a comfortable equilibrium between the cyberspace world and the real one.

I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that the benefits that come with computer use outweigh the drawbacks, but it is important to think about the repercussions of spending too much time in front of a screen and make sure to stretch our wings.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
