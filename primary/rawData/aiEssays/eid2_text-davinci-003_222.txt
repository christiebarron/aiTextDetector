When discussing censorship in libraries, the fundamental question is whether to restrict the availability of certain materials that some may deem offensive. The protection of speech and access to information is a cornerstone of our democracy, and libraries should not impede the flow of ideas nor should they be obligated to shield the public from potentially uncomfortable material.

To begin, libraries should not censor books, music, movies, or magazines available in their collection. It is important to remember that books on the shelf unopened are not being forcefully pushed onto unsuspecting patrons; instead, each individual has the right to decide for themselves what material to read, watch, and listen to. We cannot expect libraries to act as a censor, removing books and other items that may contain or express certain ideas or opinions that some may find offensive.

Further, while libraries may strive to be inclusive, they should abstain from using their power to restrict any access to intellectual material. Libraries are responsible for curating their collections—and should strive to include materials from all different backgrounds and perspectives—but that should not justify censoring any books on the shelves. No one person or group should be able to determine what material is available for patrons; instead, we should trust in the public to make their own decisions about what materials to engage with.

In conclusion, a library's mission is to enhance knowledge and understanding of the world. If libraries started to remove certain materials because of certain ideas they expressed, they would be preventing patrons from accessing key texts, stifling conversation, and undermining the importance of an informed democracy. Instead of removing offensive material, libraries should provide an open platform for readers and
