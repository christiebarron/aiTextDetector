In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting directly impact the cyclist's experience. The road, for instance, is full of "rocks and broken glass," reflecting the rough, hostile terrain the cyclist is trying to traverse. This makes the journey especially difficult, as maneuvering through such dangerous conditions requires great skill as well as a certain level of bravery.

In addition, the setting is characterized by a lack of food, water, and shelter. This implies that, as the cyclist pedals through the terrain, they become increasingly exhausted without the necessary energy, leaving them to battle further fatigue. Moreover, the elements of heat, wind, and dust further complicate and impede the cyclist's journey, as they must constantly contend with their effects.

All of this combines to create a daunting challenge that the cyclist must overcome. This environment is not only physically demanding; on an emotional level, it tests the cyclist's endurance, resilience, and determination. They must remain focused and driven, despite the punishing conditions and seemingly impossible task before them. As such, the features of the setting have a profound and direct effect on the cyclist's experience, motivating them to push through the adversity and complete their journey.
