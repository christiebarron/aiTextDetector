The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” effectively communicates the theme of hope and resilience. In the poem, Ho focuses on a hibiscus in the wintertime, which is symbolic of the struggles and challenges faced in life. The poem’s final lines hint at the idea that although the cold of winter may be overwhelming and many challenges difficult to face, there is always a chance for renewal and a chance to begin again.

The poem mentions the hibiscus “burbling, unwavering guile” and they are a symbol of the perseverance and dedication of the speaker. They stand out in the wintery landscape and refuse to give up despite the cold and the snow. The poem ends with “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?” This suggests that the speaker has something challenging coming up and is waiting for the end of winter and the return of spring to take on the challenge. The use of the hibiscus, in conjunction with the migration of the geese as a symbol of return and renewal, suggests that the speaker is determined to both persevere and also find a new beginning after winter. 

The poem effectively conveys the message of hope and resilience in the face of difficult times. The hibiscus is a reminder of the speaker's strength, and the promise of the geese in the spring symbolically demonstrates the speaker's resolve to keep going.
