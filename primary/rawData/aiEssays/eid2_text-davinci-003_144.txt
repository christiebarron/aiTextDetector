As librarians and patrons of libraries, we recognize that censorship can be a tricky and potentially controversial topic. In the age of swift and widespread access to media, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ensure that our libraries remain welcoming and safe environments, while also safeguarding the right to free expression. As such, I believe that when it comes to censorship in libraries, a balance can and should be struck between protecting vulnerable individuals and preserving free speech.

At its core, censorship in libraries is about protecting individuals from dangerous or offensive materials. In some cases, this may mean removing books, music, movies, or magazines that contain abhorrent content. This could range from reading material that promotes violence or hate speech to movies with inappropriate or explicit content. Taking these types of materials off the shelves is not only necessary, it is paramount in order to provide a safe environment for those who visit the library.

At the same time, however, libraries should not remove books or other materials from their shelves solely because they may be offensive or disagreeable to a certain individual or segment of society. Doing so would be in direct violation of the right to free expression, which is one of the cornerstones of democratic societies the world over. We must never forget that the freedom to think, express and learn without fear of censorship is a fundamental human right. 

As such, when addressing the issue of censorship in libraries, it is essential to strike a balance between protecting vulnerable individuals and preserving free speech. Libraries should remove only materials deemed to be genuinely dangerous or offensive, and never remove material solely because certain individuals or groups may disagree with its content
