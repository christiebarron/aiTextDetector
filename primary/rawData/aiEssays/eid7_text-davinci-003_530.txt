I was at a movie theater recently and the line was really long. I was waiting to get my tickets, but the line was taking forever. Everyone around me was getting frustrated, but I stayed calm and reminded myself that I would get to my seat eventually.

One woman in the line behind me was especially impatient and kept complaining about how long it was taking. I decided to initiate a conversation with her and remind her how good the movie we were about to see was gonna be. This cheers her up a bit, and she ended up thanking me for talking to her. We talked for a while, and eventually the line started to move. 

It was a small gesture, but it felt good to be patient. I could see the frustration all around me and was glad I was able to help one person in line, even if it was just a bit.
