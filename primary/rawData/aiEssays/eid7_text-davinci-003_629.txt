I witnessed a true act of patience not too long ago. My friend had tried to put together a puzzle for almost three hours. She was determined to finish it. But after a few hours of working hard, the puzzle was still incomplete.

I watched as she took a deep breath and closed her eyes for a few moments. She then opened her eyes with a newfound calmness, and slowly started putting the pieces together again.

It took her almost two more hours, but she eventually completed the puzzle. She persevered and never complained during the entire process. It was incredibly inspiring to watch. 

Her patience and dedication to the task at hand made quite an impression on me. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.
