I had been away from home for three years when I returned to visit my family for the first time. I was naturally very excited to see them, but there was an elephant in the room that created a bit of awkwardness as well.

We had planned to have dinner together so I set off for their house early to prepare a meal. When I arrived, my parents were already there, waiting for me anxiously. We made small talk for a bit, but then there was a moment of silence that seemed to stretch on forever.

Suddenly, my dad broke the tension with a joke. I laughed and so did my mom. We all burst into laughter, and the awkwardness of the situation melted away. Everyone was more relaxed, and we ended up talking and laughing for hours.

It was so great to see them laughing and smiling, and I was so relieved to be able to break the ice and reconnect with my family again. That night, laughter truly was the shortest distance between us.
