The development of the Empire State Building in New York City presented the engineers of the project with a unique challenge never before faced: how to allow dirigibles, or giant airships, to land and dock on the roof of America’s tallest skyscraper. While the idea made sense at the time, as it could have provided the perfect signage opportunity as well as direct means of transport between the building and the rest of the world, the builders faced a multitude of obstacles in bringing the idea to fruition.

The designers of the Empire State Building had to take a variety of factors into account when constructing the mooring mast. This mast was a tall pole affixed with motors and prop shafts which the dirigibles could latch onto, allowing them to dock with the building. Despite the complex engineering needed to make this possible, the first obstacle faced was the aesthetic of the idea. It was decided early on that the adding of such a mast would compromise the overall look of the building, which featured intricate Art Deco-style ornamentation. To keep the look, it was decided that the mast would simply blend in with the design, and so the construction team used a standard architects creating a highly detailed lightning rod made out of metal and embedded in the building’s exterior, thus camouflaging the mooring mast.

A further obstacle was the strength needed to hold back the airships, which can be thousands of times heavier than a balloon. Engineers worked to make sure the mast was strong enough to lead a force greater than the weight of the airship, and couldn’t fail in high winds
