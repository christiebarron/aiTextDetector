I remember one time I was on a long drive home from a business trip. I was trying to make the best of it and keep my spirits up, but the traffic was horrible. It was the kind of snarl that just seems to go on and on with no end in sight. As we inched along the highway, I became increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress. It was then I noticed that my traveling companion was quite calm and composed in the face of the situation.

Rather than complaining, he was focused on the radio, occasionally making small talk to help make the time go by more quickly. He didn't show any anger or impatience, but simply stayed positive and even-keeled no matter how bad the traffic got. His attitude was truly inspiring. 

I eventually realized that he wasn't just putting on a brave face- he was genuinely being patient and understanding. He was taking the situation as it came and not letting it drag him down. His attitude rubbed off on me, and before long I was feeling calmer too. 

We eventually made it home, and I was so grateful for his patience. His attitude started off as a source of annoyance for me, but it ended up being invaluable. I'm glad to have such a patient and understanding friend.
