The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" greatly affect the cyclist, who is the main character of the story. The three main elements of the setting are the terrain, the temperature, and the elements.

The terrain of the countryside is the primary setting feature influencing the cyclist. The cyclist must navigate winding roads, inclines, and descents. The terrain, combined with obstacles like potholes, tree roots, and jagged rocks, makes the road difficult to traverse. This physical nature of the terrain can both challenge the cyclist, creating a sense of danger, and give him a sense of freedom and exploration.

The temperature of the countryside also increases the intensity of the cyclist's experience. The heat of the sun, especially when paired with the effort of pedaling up steep hills, results in higher temperatures, further intensifying the physical experience of the cyclist.

Finally, the elements of nature—wind, rain, lightning, etc.—can further challenge the cyclist and increase the sense of danger in the story. The unpredictable nature of the elements adds an unpredictable strength and danger to the journey, especially when the cyclist must contend with the terrain and the heat.
