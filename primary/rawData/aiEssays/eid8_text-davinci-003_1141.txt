I remember the sound of my best friend's laugh like it was yesterday. We had become friends in high school and had shared plenty of laughs over the years, but this particular moment stands out in my memory.

We were out one night at a party, but it wasn't the typical kind of gathering. We were all dressed to the nines and had come together to support my friend's aunt who had just taken over the family restaurant. It was full of unfamiliar faces and people from the corporate world, and feeling a bit out of place, we decided the best thing to do was to crack a few jokes and get the evening started.

So that's what we did, each of us one-upping each other with silly puns and poor jokes that soon had the entire room filled with laughter and clapping. Without us even realizing it, we had become the entertainment for the evening and filled the room with a brilliant and cheerful atmosphere. 

And then, as usual, my friend delivered the punch line to a joke that I hadn't even heard the setup for. It was so ridiculous, so stupidly funny, that hearing her say it sent me into a fit of uncontrollable laughter so intense that I had to pause our conversation and just concentrate on catching my breath.

As I looked at her, I thought to myself how blessed I was to have this wonderful person in my life. A person who could make me forget my troubles and believe in the power of laughter. A person who truly knew the importance of being able to find the funny in life.
