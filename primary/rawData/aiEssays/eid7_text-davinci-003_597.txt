I remember the day my best friend asked me for help with her chemistry project. She had been studying for weeks but was still struggling to understand the finer points of the lesson. She asked if I could come to her place and explain it all to her. 

At the time I was really busy with my own research projects and was trying to finish a paper by the end of the week. My first impulse was to decline the offer, but I could see how much she needed the help. I decided to be patient and take some time out of my day to explain the concepts to her.

We ended up spending the entire evening going over the equations and making sure she understood each one. She got it by the end and thanked me multiple times for helping her. I felt good about being patient and taking the time to help out a friend in need.
