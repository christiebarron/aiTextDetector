The memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez provides readers with a unique and powerful look at how his life has been shaped by his family, heritage, and the places he has lived. Through a series of deeply personal stories and reflections, Rodriguez creates a mood of warmth, love, and appreciation for the close connections he has with his family, friends and the places he has lived.

The memoir is cleverly divided into several chapters, each centred around a specific place Rodriguez has lived in with each being filled with memories, pictures and stories of his family history. This structure provides a gentle reminder that Rodriguezâ€™s life has been shaped and constantly amended by the people and places he has experience from his childhood home in New Jersey, to Cuba and then finally his new home in New York. This narrative is further enhanced by the careful selection of photographs which both serve to commemorate the family events, vacations and dinners of his life, and ultimately provide readers with a deeper insight into the ideas, moulds and stories which have shaped the person he has become.

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez exudes a sense of hope and happiness which is often conveyed through his tone of voice, his storytelling and the stories themselves. Even in his discussion of the pain felt after he had moved away from home, Rodriguez instills readers with an optimism that no matter what, he can always return to his roots as these memories will always remain in his heart. As readers, this makes us feel an immense sense of comfort, understanding that Rodriguez has remained a part of his family even when times have been challenging.
