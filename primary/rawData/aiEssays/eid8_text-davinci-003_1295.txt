I was on a hike with my best friend. It was a beautiful day out, the sun was shining, there was a light breeze, and the birds were chirping. We had been walking for what felt like hours without speaking, but I was enjoying the moment. Suddenly, my best friend stumbled and twisted her ankle. I was so panicked and worried, but she said quickly, “Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.” She then tried to laugh, but winced in pain and just managed a smile. I was so relieved my friend was ok that I started laughing. We both couldn’t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. I had to help her down the hill, so I got underneath her and we started slowly walking. We were laughing about everything—the pain, the fact that we had gotten ourselves into this situation, and the fact that we were so close to the finish line before this happened. As we slowly made our way down the hill, I was so glad that we could laugh in a moment that could have been filled with anxiety and stress. Laughter had brought us through together.
