I was out for dinner with my best friend last night, and the conversation had lulled a bit. I was looking around the restaurant and noticed a pair of couples that were visiting from out-of-town. One of the men had a very thick accent and he was trying to make a joke, but no one was laughing.

My friend and I exchanged glances, and I could tell that he had the same idea as me. We both started laughing, which immediately caught the attention of the group at the other table. The people all turned and looked at us, and I could feel the tension in the air begin to dissipate. 

The man with the accent continued with his joke, and this time people actually laughed. We all started to chat with each other and within minutes, we had all become fast friends. It turns out that the man with the thick accent had traveled from Sweden to visit his family, and the other couple was from Brazil. We talked for surprisingly long time and laughed until our sides hurt.

It was really amazing how laughter was the bridge that allowed for a connection to form in this strange, seemingly foreign environment. Being able to laugh together signifies a feeling of openness and vulnerability, and it was actually a really beautiful thing to witness. 

I'm so happy that my friend and I were able to break the ice in that moment and help everyone let go of their inhibitions. It just goes to show that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people, no matter where they come from.
