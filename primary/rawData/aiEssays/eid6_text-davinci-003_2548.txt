The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic skyscrapers in history, known for being the first full-service building with its own power plant and for giving passengers an aerial view of New York City from its observation deck. Throughout its history, the Empire State Building has gone through many changes and upgrades; one of these changes was the installation of two mooring masts, intended to accommodate airships or dirigibles. Although it appeared to be a simple solution, accommodating these dirigibles required a significant amount of planning and countless obstacles. 

When architect William Lamb pitched the idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, planners were wary of the difficulties associated with accommodating these large craft. The mooring mast would need to be both durable and secure, allowing for the safe docking of large dirigibles in windy and inclement weather. This structure would need to be secure enough to prevent the ship from becoming damaged or destabilized due to wind, and would need to be lightweight enough to be able to withstand the force of a dirigible landing on the mast. Additionally, the mooring mast needed to be unobtrusive, so as to not interfere with the building or obstruct views from the observation deck. Eventually, engineers developed a breathtaking engineering solution, making it possible for dirigibles to land safely on the mooring mast, taking in passengers and cargo from all over the world. 

Despite the engineering difficulties associated with the mooring mast, dirigibles were not able to take advantage of the technology developed by engineers due to the impact of the Great Depression
