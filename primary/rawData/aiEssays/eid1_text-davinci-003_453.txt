As technology advances and more and more computers fill our everyday lives, it is necessary to reflect on the effect and impact they have on us. Computers, with their promise of increased productivity, convenience, and entertainment, can also have a detrimental impact on our lives and our societies.

Research conducted by the World Health Organization has suggested that people who spend a great deal of time on their computers are more likely to experience physical, mental, and psychological effects. These health issues may include a higher risk of the development of musculoskeletal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome; increased anxiety and depression due to changes in social interaction in virtual communities; and sleep disturbances due to extended hours of work.

In addition, computers can lead to an overload of information and excessive multitasking, which can lead to errors in judgment, poor concentration, and inefficient decision-making. All of these effects can lead to an overall decrease in productivity, thereby reducing the quality of our lives.

It is well-documented that people who spend too much time on the computer tend to lose touch with the real world and the relationships they share with their family and friends.
