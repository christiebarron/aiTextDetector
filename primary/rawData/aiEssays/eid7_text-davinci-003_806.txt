I was volunteering at a soup kitchen the other week and came across an older woman who spoke very little English yet needed assistance with the most basic of tasks. I could have easily become frustrated - constantly having to slow down and explain concepts and phrases she didn't immediately understand.

But instead, I forced myself to be patient. I kept my demeanor friendly and showed her empathy. I repeatedly assured her that I was there for her, and I would help her in any way I could.

I was successful in teaching her the basic skill she needed that day, and when I had completed my volunteer hours and returned home, I felt proud of the way I had handled the situation. Knowing that I had maintained a patient and understanding attitude had been rewarding.
