The construction of the Empire State Building represented an ambitious and remarkable feat of engineering, showcasing the advanced technology of its time in a spectacular new way. One such innovation that accompanied its construction was the plans to allow dirigibles to dock. Unfortunately, these plans were hampered by numerous obstacles, making the actualization of docking stations for dirigibles a challenge. 

In the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the unique technical challenges associated with the construction of the Empire State Building’s docking station are discussed. The biggest concern during the construction of the mast was ensuring that it was strong enough to in order to provide a secure connection between the building and the dirigible. It needed to be strong enough to withstand strong winds, heavy rains, and turbulence caused by the dirigibles themselves. Additionally, the building at the time was not wired for electricity, so the mast needed to be constructed without the aid of any electricity-powered machinery or tools. Moreover, the upper limits of the window cleaners’ cradles had not yet been calculated and tested, so the designers had to be careful not to over estimate or underestimate their measurements.

In addition to the technical difficulties, the builders also had to consider the political and financial challenges of providing a docking station for the dirigibles. The mooring mast project was extremely expensive, due to the rental of the building, necessities for infrastructure, and the cost of manpower. Furthermore, plans for the docking station had to meet regulatory standards of both the city of New York and the federal government. The building process thus
