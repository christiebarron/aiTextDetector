I remember when my best friend and I were in fourth grade. We had been best friends since third grade and were really close. One day during lunch, we were both sitting at the same table with our lunch trays. We were talking and suddenly started to laugh uncontrollably. It was over something so minor, but it totally cracked us up. 

We laughed until the tears started rolling down our faces. We were so loud that it caught the attention of the other kids in the cafeteria and soon everyone around us was laughing with us. Even the lunch ladies joined in. 

It was one of the best moments of the year and we couldnâ€™t stop laughing until lunch was over. Everyone talked about the moment the entire day. It really brought us closer as friends and reminded me how strong our bond was. 

Laughter is one of the best feelings in the world and I will never forget that moment of pure joy with my best friend.
