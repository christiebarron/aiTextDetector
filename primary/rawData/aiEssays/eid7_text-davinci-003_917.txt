I pride myself on having a patient attitude, but I'm constantly put to the test. Recently, I was traveling with a large group on an overseas trip and things were not going as planned. We had rental cars that were late, repeated flight delays, misplaced luggage, and a few unanticipated detours. It was not the most pleasant of experiences. 

But instead of panicking or getting frustrated, I put my patience to work. I stayed calm and supportive even when things weren't going my way. I made sure the group was taken care of, ensuring everyone had somewhere to stay, a ride to the airport, and a map to get where we were going. And though we ran into several unexpected issues, I kept a level head to help us navigate our way back on track.

I'm proud to say that our group made it to our destination safely, on time and with all the bells and whistles we planned for. To me, this experience perfectly showcased how patience and understanding can help us get through tricky situations and make the best of a bad situation.
