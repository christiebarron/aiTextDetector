I remember the first time I laughed with my best friend, Mike. We had been close since high school, but never quite made it past the occasional quick joke between classes. It was a particularly tough day at the office, so when my shift ended I decided to swing by his house to share some of my frustrations and vent.

When I arrived, he had some funny stories to share. We joked about our past classes and teachers, and some of the funny situations we had found ourselves in over the years. We could not help but find each others stories hilarious, and our laughter quickly escalated from chuckles to hysterical guffaws. 

Pretty soon we were in a fit of laughter, and the energy between us was contagious. I felt my tension from earlier in the day slipping away as we laughed together, and the connection between us felt stronger than ever.

I quickly came to understand why it's true that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. Laughter truly is the best medicine, but I'm so thankful that it also has the power to strengthen relationships too.
