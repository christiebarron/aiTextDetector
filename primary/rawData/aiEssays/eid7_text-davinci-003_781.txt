As a mother, there are lots of times that require me to be patient. Recently, I took my children to the park. On the way there, one of my kids asked to stop off and buy some candy. Knowing that we were already running late and I didn't want to set a bad example of indulging in sugary snacks before lunchtime, I had to be patient with my son's wish and explain why we wouldn't be stopping off to get it. Even though it was hard, I was patient and was able to explain why it was better for us to continue on our way to the park. I'm happy to say that my son was understanding and we were able to enjoy an happy day together at the park.
