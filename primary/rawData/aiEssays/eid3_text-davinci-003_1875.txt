The setting featured in Joe Kurmaskiâ€™s Rough Road Ahead plays a major role in impacting the cyclist's experience. As the cyclist, we are presented with a winding and narrow mountain road, treacherous in its terrain. This is immediately established as a difficult path, and the cyclist must herculean effort to traverse it. Her face is described as concentration and fear, and shadows loom in her peripheral vision; the setting immediately creates a mental and physical tension. 

The physical environment of the setting poses a threat to the cyclist. Her bike is set to a low gear, requiring her to use immense physical strength to maneuver along the dangerous mountain. Her progress is repeatedly halted by the many sharp turns and tight curves, forcing her to respond in order to stay upright. These demanding conditions serve to test her strength, skills, and determination. 

The backdrop of the setting creates an intimidating atmosphere. Rugged cliffs, high up on the side of the mountain, challenge her resolve as she makes her way further up. A vast abyss lies below her, giving cause for concern. She swallows her rabbit breath, instilling in her a sense of uncertainty and dread that heightens the challenge.
