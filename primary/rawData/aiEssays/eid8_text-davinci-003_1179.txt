I have plenty of happy memories, but one of my all-time favorite stories involves laughter and an unlikely encounter.

A few years ago, I had taken a day off to visit a friend, and we decided to take a drive out to the country for some fresh air. Once we got out there, we decided to take a little walk and check out the scenery. 

As we were walking down the road, we spotted an old farmhouse off in the distance. We were curious and decided to go check it out, but when we got up to the house, we noticed that no one was home. 

There was an old man sitting on the porch, and he asked us in a gruff voice what we were doing there. We both started to laugh; he had completely caught us off guard! Even though he wasn’t smiling, we could tell that he was amused by our situation, and it wasn’t long before we were all laughing together.

He ended up inviting us in for some tea, and the rest of the afternoon was spent swapping stories and laughing. By the time it was time for us to leave, we had become fast friends.

I'll never forget the feeling of that first laugh, and I still chuckle every time I think about it. Laughter truly is the best medicine for any situation.
