I remember the first time I met him. It was six months ago, on the day of my brother's wedding. We had just come out of the church and were mingling around with the other guests. He looked awkward, standing in the corner and not talking to anyone. His shirt was a little too small for him and his tie was too tight.

I couldn't help but laugh. He blushed, but then smiled. We started talking and every time I said something, he would laugh. After a while, I discovered that we shared a lot of the same interests and had the same strange sense of humor.

The laughter brought us together that day, and that spark continued to grow day after day. We quickly became close friends and then, a few months later, we started dating.

Now, every day is filled with laughter. We laugh at all our silly jokes, offbeat comments, and all the awkward moments. I wouldn't change a single thing because I truly believe that laughter is the foundation of our relationship.
