I recently had a situation where I had to be very patient. When I was out shopping, I was in line to pay at the register, and the woman in front of me had her credit card declined multiple times. She became increasingly flustered and embarrassed, and started to cry. Seeing this, I wanted to help her out as best I could, so I offered to pay for her items with my card so she would not have to deal with her issue in front of all of us. She appreciatively accepted my offer and thanked me. I was very patient with the whole situation and even though everyone else was becoming impatient behind me, I felt it was important to make sure the woman was taken care of.
