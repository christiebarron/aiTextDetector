Dear Editor,

I write to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in our society. There is no doubt that computers have had a tremendous impact on our lives, both in positive and negative ways.

On the positive side, computers are far more beneficial than detrimental. Computers have opened up doors for new opportunities and increased efficiency. They allow us to learn and work from the comfort of our own home. With computers, students can access online resources for their studies and researchers can conduct deep analysis of data. Moreover, a computer connected to the internet can be an invaluable tool to stay connected and share information.

However, it is important to remember that with great power comes great responsibility. The convenience brought by computers can also lead to problems such as physical and mental health issues. For example, too much time spent in front of computers can lead to poor posture, fatigue, stress, and eye strain. Additionally, continuously using the internet can lead to information overload, making it increasingly difficult to focus and complete tasks.

In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we work and learn, but they should be used sparingly. We must all be aware of the potential risks and make sure to practice responsible use of computers.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
