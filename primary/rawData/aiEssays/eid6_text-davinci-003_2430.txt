The ambitious ambition of the builders of the Empire State Building to allow for the docking of dirigibles was met with several obstacles. Built in 1931, the eighty-eighth floor was designed with a mooring mast, providing a possible pathway for the huge airships of the time. 

The most obvious obstacle that design engineers needed to overcome when it came to designing the mooring mast was aerodynamic in nature. In order for a dirigible to approach, dock and remain stationary with the building, the mast had to be sturdy and provide minimal drag, or wind resistance. Also, the tower had to be sufficiently tall so that it could accommodate the height of the dirigible. Constructing a mast that was three hundred and fifty feet tall posed a challenge, as it needed to be strong enough to support the weight of the airship while providing the least amount of wind resistance.

Technical difficulties and budgets were additional hurdles the engineers encountered. To lower the cost of production, engineers had to make use of existing building materials and equipment. They opted with steel cables, guide rings, and heavy pulleys, as the existing design components were familiar and agreeable to their pocketbook.

The engineers of the mooring mast had to deal with the unpredictable nature of weather. The Empire State Building already suffered from winds of over two hundred miles an hour, so it was essential that the engineers design the mast to withstand such high winds and turbulence. The engineers also had to be able to trust the airship's navigational systems and countermeasures in the instance of a mishap, and the mooring mast had
