The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" plays an important role in the story, as it affects the cyclist's experience. The story takes place on the main road of a small town in Wisconsin. It is warm outside, and the road is dry and hot. 

The dry and hot road conditions create a difficult and dangerous environment for the cyclist. The heat and sunlight increases the cyclist's fatigue, making it harder for him to focus and maintain balance, as well as making it all the more difficult for him to climb the hills. Additionally, the flat, monotonous landscape and lack of trees, storefronts, and other distractions gives the cyclist little to focus on, making him all the more conscious of his environment. All of these conditions make it challenging for the cyclist to enjoy his ride and push through the hills in this hard terrain.

The setting also affects the cyclist's emotions.

Additionally, the desperate and seemingly endless climb ahead of him creates feelings of frustration and despair.
