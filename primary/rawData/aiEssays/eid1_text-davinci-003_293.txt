Dear Editor,

As a resident of this area, I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people today. While it is true that computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, I firmly believe that they have more negative than positive effects.

Firstly, reliance on computers has caused us to lose the ability to think for ourselves and make decisions on our own. We have become so used to trusting our computers to do the work for us, that we can longer effectively use our own judgement and knowledge.

Secondly, computers have caused us to become deeply embedded in our virtual lives. We spend more time on our phones and computers looking at our social media profiles, rather than spending quality time with family and friends. This has led to increased levels of isolation and loneliness, as well as decreased levels of productivity.

Finally, computers have brought about the emergence of artificial intelligence. This technology has caused a great deal of disruption to many areas of work, leading to unemployment and job insecurity for many people.

Overall, I firmly believe that computers have more negative effects than positive ones. I urge the readers of this paper to take this into account and reflect on how we can better mitigate the negative impacts that computers have on ourselves and our communities.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
