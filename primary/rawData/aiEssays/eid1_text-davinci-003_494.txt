Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on peopleâ€™s lives. In this day and age, computers are everywhere and play an integral role in how we live. While computers can certainly be useful and efficient at helping us accomplish tasks and connect with people, I believe they have had a mixed impact on society and have both positive and negative effects on people. 

On the positive side, computers have made our lives easier and more convenient. By connecting people all over the world, people can easily collaborate and interact with one another. Even something as trivial as purchasing a plane ticket or checking the weather is made much simpler with the use of computers. Additionally, computers are incredibly helpful tools for people studying or working in technology. 

However, on the negative side, I believe that computers can cause people to become too dependent on them and lose out on meaningful human connections. With social media, people are spending more and more time on their computers instead of spending time outside and being active. It can also lead to a strain in relationships as people prefer to be on their phones or computers rather than talking or spending time with their partners.

In conclusion, while computers can provide a lot of benefits to people, they should be used with caution and in moderation. We can better our lives by spending less time on computers and more time fostering meaningful relationships with our loved ones.

Sincerely,
