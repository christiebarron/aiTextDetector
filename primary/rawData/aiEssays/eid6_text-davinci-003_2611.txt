The Empire State Building was constructed in 1931 with the intent of being the world’s tallest building. While it certainly achieved that goal, it had an even grander ambition—to become a hub of air traffic, with dirigibles allowed to dock at the building’s 78th floor. In his book The Mooring Mast, author Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The first challenge was the fact that dirigibles, or blimps, tended to be too large to dock. The plan had been to construct a tall mast at the 78th floor with a net, called a mooring mast, that the blimps would be able to catch onto. Each balloon would be equipped with large hooks that could attach to the mooring mast and allow the passengers to disembark. 

The main issue was that, while the blimps were quite large, their natural buoyancy kept them slightly aloft and this, combined with their tendency to bob and drift in the wind, made them difficult to accurately anchor. If they weren’t properly secured, they could pull themselves free from the mooring mast as they drifted. Thus, the builders had to come up with a way to better secure the blimps and keep them in place.

The engineers solved the problem by constructing a massive metal checkerboard at the base of the mooring mast, beneath the 78th floor. This device provided great stability for the blimps and allowed them to dock without
