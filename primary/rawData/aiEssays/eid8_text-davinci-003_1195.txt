I was experiencing a rough day at school and walking home from my classes had me feeling defeated. I was so immersed in my thoughts that I didn't notice my neighbor climbing the stairs until he was standing right beside me. He said hello in a sweet, friendly tone and I told him hello back. We exchanged a few more pleasantries, but it wasn't until we were both laughing about something silly he said that I actually snapped out of my funk. 

The light-hearted conversation we shared as we climbed the rest of the steps had a way of brightening my mood. He was so kind and understanding, and it felt so good to laugh with someone and see the tension in my body relax. When we parted ways, I found myself smiling all the way home, feeling a sense of peace and ease that I hadn't felt in days. I can still remember how laughter felt that day and how it brought me closer to my neighbor.
