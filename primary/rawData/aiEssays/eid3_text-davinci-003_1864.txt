The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” serves to heighten the tension of the cyclist’s journey and highlight the obstacles in his path. The terrain of the countryside is largely rural, made up of patchy shrubbery, rolling hills, and unwelcoming farms. This landscape alone is enough to make the cyclist’s task more difficult, but the descriptions of the actual roads are even more daunting. On his journey, the cyclist faces narrow roads without room for him to move out of the way, potholes that could cause a puncture and threaten him with a breakdown, and sharp stones that line the roads and are designed to catch unsuspecting cyclists and their bikes. Kurmaski’s imagery of the narrow road, potholes, and lurking stones heightens the tension of the story and puts the cyclist at a greater disadvantage.

The cyclist’s isolation from other people and from the outside world is also key to the setting. The cyclist does not encounter any other riders or people throughout his entire journey; instead, the only thing that he can rely on for assurance are the rugged roadside cottages that break up the otherwise hostile landscape.
