Dear Editor, 

I am voicing my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is my belief that computers are becoming essential in todayâ€™s world, as well as potentially dangerous when used improperly.

On the positive side, computers not only provide us with the ability to communicate, but also give us access to a vast array of knowledge and information. Computers can help us to stay organized and efficient by managing our schedules and activities faster and more efficiently than ever before. Additionally, the use of computers has enabled us to make innovative advances in science, technology, and medical research, improving our lives in the process. 

On the flip side, however, computers can also be extremely detrimental to our health when abused. The increase in computer usage has resulted in an increase of such health risks as repetitive stress injuries, vision problems, carpal tunnel syndrome, and more. Furthermore, research has linked increased computer usage with mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and OCD. Therefore, it is important to use computers in moderation in order to avoid any of these issues.

In conclusion, I believe that the use of computers can have both positive and negative effects, depending on the level of usage. It is essential to maintain a healthy balance between using this technology and utilizing other activities, in order to ensure that we reap the benefits that computers have to offer without any of the detrimental health risks.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name
