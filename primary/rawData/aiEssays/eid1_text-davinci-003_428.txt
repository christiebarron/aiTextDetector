Dear Editor,

I'm writing to voice my opinion about the impact computers have had on our lives. My opinion is that the effects of computers have been overwhelmingly positive.

It's impossible to deny that computers have changed the way we live, how we work and how we interact with the world. We are now able to be more productive and save money by automating mundane tasks, reducing the amount of time we spend on them. We can also keep informed on current events, thanks to instant updates from news outlets delivered directly to our computers.

It's also true that computers have made us more connected than ever before. We're now able to communicate with people around the world, either through messages or video calls, without having to leave our homes. This has opened up opportunities for people that weren't available before, such as being able to work remotely or form friendships online.

We are also able to access vast amounts of knowledge at the click of a button, which helps us to become better informed and more educated.

In conclusion, computers have proven to be a powerful force not just in our everyday lives, but in our future as well. I believe that the positive effects they have had have made our lives better in many ways and I urge your readers to consider this.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
