The other day I was in line at the supermarket, when a couple in front of me got into a heated argument. I could feel my frustration starting to build from the delay and how everyone in line was being so disruptive, but I reminded myself to remain patient and not to get angry. 

Instead, I counted to 10 in my head, took a deep breath and stepped back. After a few minutes, the couple finally calmed down, apologized to each other, and left. 

Once again, patience had been my ally and my temper had not got the best of me. I may have been late in completing my errand, but the important thing was that I had remained calm, compassionate and understanding throughout the situation.
