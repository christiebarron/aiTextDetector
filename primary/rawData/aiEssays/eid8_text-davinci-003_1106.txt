I’ll never forget my first date with John. We had arranged to meet at a local cafe and I was so anxious about making a good impression. We hit it off right away, talking about anything and everything for hours. He made me laugh almost non-stop throughout the date – I was in stitches!

I particularly remember when I was telling him about a funny incident at work. I had such a fit of laughter that I could barely keep talking. John couldn’t keep a straight face either and we were both in hysterics.

The other customers in the cafe were giving us funny looks but it didn’t stop us. We laughed until our sides ached and I felt so relaxed and at ease with him. It was an amazing date and I was so glad that we had connected on that level. 

I’m still with John today and it’s the laughter that always brings us back together. He’s my soul mate and I love that I can rely on him to make me laugh all these years later.
