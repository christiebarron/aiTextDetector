I recently experienced a situation where I had to show a great deal of patience. I had received a package from Amazon that I was really looking forward to and couldn't wait to open it. However, when I went to open the package I realized that it had been taped shut and it would take a bit of effort to open it. I noticed that my father was watching me and I could sense that he wanted to help me by opening it. 

I knew that I should let him do it, since he's always been very eager to help me, but I also wanted to try and open it myself since it would give me a sense of accomplishment. So, I took my time and fiddled around with it, trying to find the right angle to pop it open.

My father seemed slightly frustrated, but he stayed patient and allowed me to finagle my way through the package. After a few minutes of frustration, I managed to open the package using nothing but my own power. When it was opened, my dad just smiled and gave a nod of approval.

I was impressed by how patient he had been in allowing me to figure out how to open the package by myself. It was an important lesson in being present and valuing the process, rather than the outcome. Even though it seemed like a small moment, I was proud of myself for being able to open the package without help, and proud of my father for his patience.
