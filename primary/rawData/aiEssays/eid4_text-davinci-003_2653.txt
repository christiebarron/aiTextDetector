The final line of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” speaks to the resilience of nature in the face of adversity. After watching the hibiscus branch remain firm and unbroken as a winter snowstorm passes, the speaker turns their focus within, symbolizing the power of internal growth in the face of challenging circumstances.

The “test” referenced in the poem is an apt metaphor for the various struggles we all endure in life. Whether it’s a physical, mental, or emotional trial, the speaker finds solace in the notion that our individual strength and determination can help us overcome even the most daunting of challenges.

Just as the hibiscus branch remains firm in the winter storm, the speaker finds strength in their facility to weather life’s storms just as the hibiscus will. This is further reinforced through the imagery of geese that migrate in the spring, symbolizing the carpe diem mentality that hard times pass and it’s necessary to rise up through them.

The poem speaks to the power of optimism in the face of challenges; lessons we can all benefit from in trying times. As long as we put our efforts towards achieving our goals, just like the hibiscus branch, “when the snows melt” we can reach our final destination. Through the metaphor of the hibiscus, Ho is conveying the message that even in times of hardship and turbulence, with persistence, optimism, and most importantly, hope, we can all make it through whatever life throws our way
