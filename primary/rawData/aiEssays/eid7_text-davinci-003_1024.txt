I was at the airport, waiting for my flight for what felt like hours. The flight had been delayed several times, and my patience was growing thin. I was getting more and more frustrated as the minutes ticked by. 

Finally, after some more delay, the airline announced that my flight was officially cancelled. I was angry and ready to complain, but I noticed that there was a long line of people just like me. Instead of being impatient, I decided that being patient was my best course of action. 

So, I waited in line, and soon enough I was at the counter talking to the airline representative. I could tell the representative was really trying to help me and I could tell he was doing the best he could under the circumstances. 

I was kind and understanding, and tried to remain calm and patient throughout our conversation. The airline representative did everything he could to get me on a flight as soon as possible, and I was extremely thankful for his help. 

In the end, after being patient, my frustratingly delayed experience ended with a smile on my face. And I was thankful to have been able to remain patient throughout the process.
