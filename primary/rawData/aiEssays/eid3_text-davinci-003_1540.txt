In Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead', the features of the setting have a large impact on the cyclist. The settings of the story consist of a winding hilly road, accompanied by limited visibility from the fog and rain. 

In the story, the downhill section of the road causes the cyclist to lose control and results in the accident. The downhill grade of the road makes it more difficult for the cyclist to control his bike and his speed, since gravity is pushing the bike forward. The combination of low visibility from the fog and rain further complicates matters, as it eliminates the cyclist's ability to see the upcoming terrain and prepare for it accordingly.

The fog and rain also contribute to the cyclist's fatigue. As the cyclist rides through the fog and rain, some of his energy is diverted in an effort to keep himself warm and dry. This increase in energy expenditure contributes to the cyclist's overall exhaustion. 

The terrain of the road additionally contributes to the cyclist's fatigue by forcing him to continuously adjust his body and bike in order to take the turns that challenge his balance and stability. This is particularly difficult given the limited traction of the tires resulting from the presence of the fog and rain.
