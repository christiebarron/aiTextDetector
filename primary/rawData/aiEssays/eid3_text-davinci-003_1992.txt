The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" have a considerable impact on the cyclist  as experience of the environment changes through different settings. The suburban settings suggest a much more organized, regulated and maintained roadways, which contributes to a smoother cycling experience that the cyclist enjoys during the beginning of the story. The cyclist revels in the convenience of the traffic lights, stop signs, and the threat of an accident very minimal. These settings make it easier for the cyclist as they have a sense of security despite the hustle and bustle of cars passing by.

The rural setting poses a much greater challenge to the cyclist. The cyclist has to be more vigilant and nimble due to the lack of street markings, warning signs and various other architectural indicators. This lack of security and convenience means the cyclist must always be alert and ready to adjust their riding accordingly. The cyclist has to avoid numerous hazards that the rural setting offers such as potholes, sand, wind, even animals. Loss of balance and control is a real risk with the road surface being uneven, bumpy and narrow. The cyclist is forced to anticipate the bumpiness of the terrain and adjust their speed to suit the particular environment.
