I was out with a group of friends the other night, and we were all having a great time. We were talking and laughing about a variety of things. At one point, someone told a really funny joke that had everyone in stitches. We were all bent over, laughing and wiping tears from our eyes.

The moment was incredibly special to me. Even though these were all relatively new friends, all of us together in that moment felt like family. No matter what was going on, everyone was united in our collective joy. 

That's when I realized how powerful laughter can be. It's a force that can bring complete strangers together and make them all feel part of something greater. Laughter, in this case, was the shortest distance between us, and that connection was beautiful. 

It's a moment that I'll never forget. Afterwards, we all went our separate ways, but the shared laughter still binds us all together today.
