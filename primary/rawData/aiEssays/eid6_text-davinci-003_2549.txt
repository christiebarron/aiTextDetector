The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to create a facility for docking dirigibles. These included technological, economic, political and safety issues.

The primary technological issue was the challenge of safely securing a large airship to the building. Initially, the designers decided to use a series of steel arms, known as mooring masts, which would be extended over a 200-foot gap between the building and the airship. This concept was approved, but a major problem arose in finding a way to structurally connect the arms and the building. After much experimentation, engineers eventually settled on a clover-shaped track which would allow the masts to be inserted through slots in the building's side and attached firmly.

The economic challenge posed by providing dirigible docking facilities was substantial. Not only did installing mooring masts involve significant engineering costs, but also the expense of making them strong enough to hold the weight of a large airship. Furthermore, operating a mooring station was estimated to cost thousands of dollars a year. This meant that there had to be a strong economic case made to justify the expense.

The project also faced political obstacles. After the builders had secured the right to moor dirigibles at the Empire State Building, they had to secure the permission of the Federal Air Ministry, who were concerned that allowing dirigibles to dock there would disrupt air traffic. They demanded that the mooring masts be equipped with lights so that pilots could distinguish them from the rest of the building.

Lastly, safety concerns had to be addressed. As
