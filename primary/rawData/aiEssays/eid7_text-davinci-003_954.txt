 

Recently, my boss asked me to take on an extra project at work. It seemed like a lot of extra work, but I gritted my teeth and took it on. I was a little overwhelmed, so instead of rushing through the work I stopped and took a few deep breaths. I reminded myself that I was capable of completing the task, and that it would be worth it in the end. 

I took my time to make sure everything was up to standard, and I made a conscious effort to remain patient even when the project seemed daunting and overwhelming. When I felt my patience waning, I took another deep breath and focused on the end result. I didn't get frustrated and instead remained steadfast in my finished product. 

By the time I handed in the project, I felt a huge sense of pride. I was pleased that I had been patient throughout the entire process - even when I felt like getting frustrated - and I was glad I had kept an open and patient mind. It really paid off in the end!
