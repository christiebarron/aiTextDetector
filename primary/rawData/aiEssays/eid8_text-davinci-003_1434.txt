I remember the first time I met my wife. We were coworkers at the time, but had never spoken to each other. One day, I decided to break the ice and introduce myself. When I walked up to her, I thought of a joke I had heard recently and decided to try it out. I asked her, “Why don’t scientists trust atoms?” I waited a moment and answered my own joke with, “Because they make up everything!”

We both started laughing and I was so relieved. I was afraid to make a fool of myself, but it turned out to be the best thing that could have happened. From that moment on, we were both incredibly comfortable with each other. We talked and laughed together over lunch and slowly started to build a friendship.

That was three years ago and today, my wife and I are happily married. We laugh together about anything and everything. Whenever things get tough or stressful, we can rely on our shared sense of humor and laughter to get us through it. I’m so thankful that I took a risk and told that joke, as it’s become one of the defining moments of our relationship and led us to where we are today.
