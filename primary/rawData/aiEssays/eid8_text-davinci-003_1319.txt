I was walking down the street, feeling a bit overwhelmed by life and my thoughts were beginning to spiral into despair. All of a sudden, a stranger walking towards me on the sidewalk caught my eye and a broad smile flashed across his face. For no reason at all, he started to laugh and then I found myself chuckling, too. 

We both stopped walking, looked at each other and burst into fits of laughter. We hadn't exchanged a single word, but somehow, this stranger had managed to make me laugh. 

It felt so good to laugh like that, after so many weeks of feeling so down. This strange man and I stood there in the middle of the street, laughing our hearts out until our sides ached and tears ran down our faces. 

Finally, we both slowed down and smiled at each other. We said our goodbyes and went our separate ways, but the memory of our shared laughter still brought a smile to my face. I had made a connection with a complete stranger, solely through laughter, and that felt so good. That moment of laughter shared between us, and the lightness it had brought me, served as a reminder that joy and happiness can still be found and shared, even in the darkest of times.
