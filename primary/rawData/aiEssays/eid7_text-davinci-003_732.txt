I recently went to the store to get some groceries. I had a lot of items to pick up and knew it could take a while. As I was picking out my food, I noticed the person in front of me had some difficulty deciding what they wanted. I knew the cashier was running behind and I didn't want to make the line any longer, so I waited patiently. The person eventually made up their mind after spending about 15 minutes in the aisle. When they finally reached the checkout, I noticed the cashier was getting noticeably frustrated, but I remained composed. I let the cashier know that I didn't mind waiting for them to take their time picking out what they wanted. After the cashier finished with their order, they thanked me for being so understanding. I was happy to know that my patience had a positive effect on the situation.
