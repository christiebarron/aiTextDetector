I remember being in an incredibly long line at the grocery store check out before the pandemic. I was already in a sour mood as I was late for an appointment, but was still trying to get groceries in before going to it. After spending more than an hour in the grocery store and another 45 minutes in line, I finally reached the check out. Just as I was about to order the items I had, a friendly elderly gentleman came up behind me and asked if he could "cut in".

Now, I was already a bit exasperated at this point and my initial reaction was to wave him off, but since I'm an avid believer in politeness and respect, I decided to be patient and swallow my impatience. I stepped aside and let the elderly gentleman go first. It seemed to take forever as he pulled out change from his pocket, rummaged through his wallet, and asked for discounts on certain items.

The cashier was equally patient and understanding, giving him offers and discounts whenever possible. Right before, I was about to lose my remaining patience, the elderly gentleman finished his order and apologized for taking so long. I smiled and told him it was no problem at all, and thanked him for making my already rushed day a bit easier.

I ended up being 15 minutes late for my appointment, but I was proud of myself for being patient in that situation. It was definitely a learning experience for me and it showed me the importance of valuing others and the virtue of patience and understanding.
