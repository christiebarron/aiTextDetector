I was out shopping one day and, as always, there were huge crowds. I was waiting in line at the checkout when I noticed a woman in front of me struggling. As it turns out, she had forgotten her wallet, and she was worried she wouldn’t be able to buy the items she had just picked out. She explained who to the cashier, who offered her a gracious smile and said, “No worries, take your time and come back when you’re ready.”

I expected the woman to be shamed or embarrassed, but instead she just stood there and took a few deep breaths. I could tell she was trying to be patient with herself and not let this difficult situation take away from her joy. After a few moments, she thanked the cashier and walked away.

I felt so inspired by her ability to handle this tricky situation with grace and composure. To me, it was a reminder of the importance of having patience, even in difficult moments. I smiled to myself and thought to myself, “That’s what being patient looks like.”
