I was out on a date with my boyfriend. We had just finished dinner and were heading back to our house when my feet started hurting. My boyfriend noticed my look of discomfort and starting laughing. I asked him what was so funny and grinned when he told me that he needed to carry me home. Immediately I burst into laughter, shaking my head in protest. But he wouldn’t relent so I finally gave in, knowing I wouldn’t win this one.

He bent over and gently lifted me up, cradling me in his arms and marching forward. I felt so embarrassed walking down the street, but there was laughter in my voice: the contagious kind that makes you want to laugh even if you don’t understand it. I just couldn’t help it. We passed by people on their way home from dinner, who stopped and smiled as we walked. Even my embarrassment couldn’t stop me from laughing as we made our way back home.

It was such a silly, small moment, but it felt so beneficial. It reminded me of the importance of humor in any relationship. No matter how hard life can be, there’s always time to share a laugh and some joy. We both needed that reminder that night.
