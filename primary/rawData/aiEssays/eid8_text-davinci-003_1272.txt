I had been dating my boyfriend, Mark, for a few weeks when we decided to go out for some drinks with a group of our friends. It was a great chance for us to get to know each other better, but I was still feeling a bit nervous. 

When the drinks arrived, our conversation got off to a great start, and it wasn’t long before I started to relax. Eventually, the conversation shifted to funny stories, which is when things really kicked off. We swapped tales of wild adventures and ridiculous pranks, but it was Mark’s stories that really had me in stitches.

He had us all in fits of laughter and I found myself feeling more and more relaxed with him. I could feel this special connection growing between us and it made me happier than I’d felt in a long time.

The night was a huge success, and as we left the bar, I realized that I had discovered something truly important about my relationship with Mark. That night, I learned that laughter was going to be the key to our success.
