I was out with my friends at a comedy show and I was having a great time. We were all guffawing at the jokes and I was snatched back to reality when I felt a tap on my shoulder from the person sitting next to me.

As I turned around, I was met with bright eyes, a wide smile, and a tall glass of red wine held in shaking hands. I smiled back, unsure of what was happening.

He jokingly asked me if I was enjoying the show and as soon as I started to answer he burst out in a fit of uproarious laughter. I was instantly taken aback, but I soon found myself in the throes of laughter with him.

We spent the whole night talking and laughing together, and while the show went on we talked about our lives and joked around with each other. As the night drew to a close, I asked him for his number. He smiled and said yes, telling me that it was the best night he had had in a long time, and thanked me for making him laugh.

I walked away with my heart full and a newfound friend who I know I can always turn to to make me laugh.
