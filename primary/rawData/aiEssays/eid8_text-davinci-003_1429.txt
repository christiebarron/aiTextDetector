I remember it like it was yesterday. I had just been invited over to my best friend's house for dinner and was really looking forward to it. We hadn't seen each other in weeks, and I knew she had some great stories to tell.

We settled in and started catching up on each other's lives as we usually did. As we talked, we started to bring up some old times and soon enough we were both laughing so hard that tears came to our eyes. We couldn't stop laughing until there wasn't a single sound left in the room- our rumbling laughter was the only thing filling it.

After that special moment of laughter, I knew that our friendship was stronger than ever. I thought to myself, 'Laughter is the shortest distance between two people'. I recall feeling a flow of warmth and love that can only come from two people sharing a genuine moment of laughter.

Ever since that day, laughter has remained an important part of our relationship. When we fight, when we laugh and when we are sad, we rely on this special way of connecting. Thatâ€™s why to this day, laughter is the foundation that holds our bond together.
