The Empire State Building was a marvel of engineering when it was completed in 1931, but the architects created something truly revolutionary by including a dock for a dirigible on the roof of the building, a complex and challenging feat. This would revolutionize transportation and many saw the potential, but there were a lot of obstacles that had to be overcome in order for this to become a reality.

The first obstacle to the dirigible dock was the fact that the dirigible needed a safe landing area with no obstructions. This was quite a problem since the Empire State Building was in the middle of one of the most densely populated cities in the world. To solve this, the architects called in a specialized engineer from the German company, Krupp. He designed a rectangular mooring area, or mast, on the roof of the Empire State Building, with a steel structure that had a wooden deck suited for the size and shape of the dirigibles, and was able to hold them in high winds if necessary.

The next obstacle was to ensure that the air around the mast was stable enough for the landing and docking. This proved to be quite a difficult process due to the intense air currents surrounding the building, as well as the high levels of heat and humidity in the summer months. To counter this, the engineers installed large fans near the top of the mast to push the air away from it, helping to create a pocket of still air around the mast and ensuring that the dirigibles had an easy landing.

The last major obstacle was the fact that the Empire State Building sits atop an active waterway, and this caused
