The ending of Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” speaks to the idea of perseverance and resilience that is often found in both Chinese culture and nature itself. The protagonist has worked hard throughout her school year, but still has not achieved a good grade in English. However, as the poem draws to an end, it appears that she has come to accept her situation and resolved to try again in the spring. By ending her poem with “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” she alludes to the notion that the turning of the seasons brings with it new perspectives and hope.

This idea of renewal is somewhat of a rhetorical device that is often used in Chinese literature and art. For example, Hou-tien, a traditional Chinese painting style, would often include landscapes of colorful flowers and birds to symbolize seasons of promise and new beginnings. Additionally, Chinese literature often includes poems that signify and celebrate nature as a way to awaken a transcendent awareness and renew one’s spirit and beliefs. In this same way, “Winter Hibiscus” ends with spring in order to evoke these notions of hope and the idea that the protagonist will try again in the coming months. 

Writing with an air of acceptance, “Winter Hibiscus” portrays a powerful message of resilience. It highlights the idea that even in life’s most difficult times, taking solace in nature can bring a sense of peace,
