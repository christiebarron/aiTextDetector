I remembered the day when my son was learning to ride a bike. He had been trying all week, but he just couldn't perfect the timing of pedaling and balancing. He kept tipping over, getting frustrated and wanting to give up.

I could see the disappointment in his face, but I knew he'd eventually get it if he kept practicing. So, I didn't rush him or pressure him. I just encouraged him and reminded him to keep trying. I told him that even if he fell it was still progress and not to give up. 

My patience paid off as he finally got it. He started pedaling and balancing on his own and he was so proud of himself. It was a great moment for both of us.
