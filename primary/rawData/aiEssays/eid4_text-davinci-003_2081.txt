The poem ‘Winter Hibiscus’ by Minfong Ho is a reflective-style poem that touches upon themes of hope and unity in the face of difficult moments. The poem’s end line is filled with meaning and reflects the memorable journey that the hibiscus flowers take and serves as a bridge between the present and the future. By connecting the hibiscus flowers’ comeback in the spring to the speaker taking the test again, the poem suggests that even though the speaker may have gone through a difficult situation and a potentially failed test, they remain hopeful and determined to pass in the future. 

The hibiscus symbolizes resilience and hope. In the poem, the flowers have gone through a difficult time. Even though they have been frozen and broken in the winter snow, they still come back in the spring when “the snows melt and the geese return.” This suggests that no matter what may come, the hibiscus flowers (and by extension, the speaker) will still find courage and strength to continue and survive. 

Moreover, the return of the hibiscus flowers in the spring also symbolizes the potential for change and growth. Even though the speaker may have failed the test in the past, they remain determined and hopeful that they will pass the test when the hibiscus flowers come back in the spring. The particular focus on the hibiscus flowers budding suggests that the speaker is focused on their own journey of self-growth and development, whilst also reflecting on their path of perseverance and resilience.
