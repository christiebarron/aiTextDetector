I remember the day I met my future husband like it was yesterday. We were both in line for the amusement park rides, and neither of us was especially looking forward to the long wait. He must have noticed my obvious boredom, because he suddenly started to say something and I couldn't help but giggle. The next thing I knew he was beaming at me with a huge smile and I couldn't help but smile back.

He started telling me jokes and funny stories and I could tell that he was really trying to make me laugh. I think it was that moment that I knew he was the one. We continued talking and he kept making me laugh until it was finally our turn to get on the ride. We continued talking throughout the ride, but all I could think about was how much he had made me laugh and how happy that had made me feel. 

From then on, laughter has been an important part of our relationship and we have always used it as a way to bridge any difficulties that may come our way. Ten years later, we've been married for five and still can't get enough of each other's company, even when we both know the other has heard the joke before. So I'm grateful for that day in the amusement park, when a little bit of laughter brought us together and changed our lives forever.
