Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers and how they impact people. It's clear that computers are part of our everyday lives and have become an important tool for our society. From managing finances to helping with research, computers have become essential for our modern lives.

At the same time, however, I believe that computers can have a negative impact on people, too. Spending too much time online can be isolating, leading to feelings of loneliness and detachment from the real world. Furthermore, spending too much time on a computer can cause stress, leading to health issues, such as headaches and insomnia.

To combat these negative effects, I believe it's important to find a healthy balance between computer use and real life interactions. Allowing yourself to take a break from the computer and engaging in face-to-face interaction can bring many benefits to your wellbeing.

On the upside, computers can help us connect with people from all over the world and help us stay updated on world events. In the business world, computers can help us make informed decisions quickly, improve communication between employees and cut cost significantly. 

As you can see, computers can be both a blessing and a curse. I urge your readers to find a healthy balance between computer usage and real life so that we can all reap the benefits of being connected, without sacrificing our mental and physical health.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
