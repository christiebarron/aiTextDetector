When I was in college, I had the opportunity to spend a semester abroad. It was a great experience, and one I wouldn't have traded for anything, but there were a lot of adjustments that had to be made in order to make it a success. Adapting to an unfamiliar language, different customs, and a different way of life was quite the challenge.

No matter how difficult things got, my patience kept me going. I tried not to compare my foreign experience to what I was used to at home, and instead, I tried to learn the language and build relationships with locals. I would often find myself feeling frustrated when language barriers caused miscommunication, but I kept reminding myself to remain patient.

It was hard learning how to do things differently and having patience as I adjusted to the new environment. There were times when I failed and people looked at me in confusion--times when I felt like giving up. Fortunately, with patience and practice, I eventually got the hang of things.

The patience I learned during my time abroad has stayed with me. It taught me that things don't happen overnight, and that different methods can yield the same result. I learned to appreciate differences and to embrace new experiences. Ultimately, it made me a better person.
