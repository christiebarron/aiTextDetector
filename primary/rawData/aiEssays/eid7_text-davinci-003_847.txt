I remember one time when I was grocery shopping with my mom and we had spent a long time in the store. We had gone up and down the aisles multiple times and we were both exhausted and ready to go home. As I was about to push the cart to the checkout line, my mom realized that she had forgotten something. She quickly ran back to get what she needed, leaving me to wait with the cart. 

I must admit that I wasn't too pleased with the idea of waiting. I was tired, and I was ready to go home. However, I remembered my mom telling me to always be patient, no matter how difficult it may feel. So, I decided to take a deep breath and be understanding of the situation. 

I stood there with the cart, not complaining, not groaning, not moving. I just stayed there, patiently and calmly, until my mom returned a few minutes later with what she had forgotten. We could then check out, which made me quite happy, but I was proud of myself for managing to stay patient in spite of wanting to leave.
