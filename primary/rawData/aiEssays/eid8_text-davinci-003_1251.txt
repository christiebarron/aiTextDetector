I was out for dinner with my husband of two years, celebrating our anniversary. He brought me to my favorite Italian restaurant, an old family establishment that I'd loved since I was a kid. We were both in great spirits, laughing and talking about our lives and the funny things that had happened over the past year. 

Near the end of dinner, the waiter came over again to show us our bill and wish us a happy anniversary. My husband and I shared a knowing smile and we both couldn’t help but laugh. It felt like such a special moment and we had to giggle a bit at how nice it was that the waiter had remembered. 

My husband then proceeded to pay the bill and, as the waiter was thanking him, he winked and shared a joke to make us both laugh. The combination of my husband's joke, the waiter’s gracious congratulations and the personal connection between us all created this carefree, happy atmosphere that I found myself falling into. 

It was a wonderful feeling that I'd never forget. In that moment, I was struck with the recognition that laughing together strengthens relationships and as I looked at my husband, I was filled with an overwhelming sense of appreciation and love.
