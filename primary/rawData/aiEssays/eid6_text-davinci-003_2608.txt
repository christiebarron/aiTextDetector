The Empire State Building was a great feat of engineering and construction when it was unveiled in 1931. As one of the tallest structures ever built, one of the most innovative features planned for the Empire State Building was the ability for dirigibles such as airships to actually dock and land on the building’s roof. However, this plan was fraught with difficulty and numerous challenges had to be overcome before the airship mooring mast could actually be erected.

One of the biggest issues was the design of the mast. Early ideas included a movable platform, or a davit-like device that could be lowered from the building’s roof. However, these solutions had the potential to obstruct the traffic flying in and out of the nearby airports. The mast itself also had to be incredibly tall, as the dirigibles that were flying in those days could be up to 400 feet in length. Furthermore, the mast had to be able to withstand the strong winds that would often billow across the sky. This meant that the mast had to be built to be incredibly stable and robust, while also being lightweight and attractive.

Another issue that had to be addressed was the cost. Building such a tall structure was incredibly costly and the costs had to be kept down as much as possible. Furthermore, the building had to be insured for the possibility that an airship could potentially crash into the Empire State Building. It was decided that the airships would be tethered to the building with wire ropes in order to minimize the risk of a disaster.

The final issue was the problem of access. The moor
