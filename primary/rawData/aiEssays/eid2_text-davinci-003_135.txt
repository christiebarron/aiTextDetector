In a time where censorship runs rampant, it is time to take a stand against the complete and total removal of materials from libraries due to the opinion of a few. Libraries are a significant source of education for many, and restricting the types of materials that can be acquired limits the opportunities for learning and understanding.

Censorship has been argued since ancient times, but it is especially pertinent now when much of what is deemed “offensive” is constantly changing. Equally important is the human right to freedom of speech, which is essential to societal progress. Therefore, the sudden removal of materials from libraries due to their “offensive” content is a violation of this right.

Libraries should offer a wide variety of materials to its patrons, including controversial works in order to foster critical thinking. Furthermore, libraries should provide educational resources on topics deemed “offensive” in order to better understand its content. Limiting access to certain types of materials only serves to discourage self-expression and intellectual freedom. 

It is important to understand that limiting access to materials will not stop their consumption; it will only drive it underground. Resources such as books and movies tend to acquire a certain amount of taboo when they become censored, further enticing the consumption of the material. Therefore the limitation of resources previously available through the library may have a negative impact on society at large.

All in all, censorship in libraries should be a last resort. Managed in a responsible way, libraries should provide its patrons access to a variety of materials as a well as educational resources to better understand their content. This allows for intellectual freedom
