In the early days of air travel, the mooring mast for dirigibles on the now iconic Empire State Building spanned the last 400 feet of the skyscraperâ€™s sleek, streamlined frame. While this idea seemed revolutionary and routine in theory, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles in actually accommodating the docking of dirigibles. 

The Empire State Building was designed to support the heavy weight of an airship mooring mast, which measured an impressive 24 feet wide, 48 feet long, and weighed approximately 24 tons. However, engineers quickly realized that the average, run of the mill mast could not support the sheer size and weight of the dirigibles, and thus began to research more advanced materials to construct the mast itself. This inspired the use of steel trusses and girders, a rather innovative development at the time. 

Furthermore, the size and shape of the mooring mast posed unique difficulties in terms of its integration within the Empire State Building. The architect Robert Forster Mills was tasked with integrating the mast into the steel structure of the building and the task proved to be quite difficult. In particular, Mills had to design the tower such that two steel platens, or platforms, could be connected to the top. 

The build of the mast also brought forth a myriad of engineering challenges. Due to its sheer size, the mooring mast had to be divided into two sections in order to fit within the confines of the Empire State Building. This meant that the two platens needed to be securely held together. To do this,
