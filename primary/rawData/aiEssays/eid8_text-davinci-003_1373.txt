I love the sound of laughter; it always brings a smile to my face and lifts my spirits.  Last week, my best friend and I were having coffee and catching up for the first time in ages. We had been best friends since childhood and it felt great to connect after so long. 

After exchanging news about work and family, we got to reminiscing about the old days. We were soon laughing hysterically at all the silly things we used to do together, including our crazy nickname for the principal at our old school. 

Every time we thought we had stopped laughing, one of us would hit the other with another anecdote and we were off again. After what felt like hours, our laughter began to slow until we had composed ourselves again. 

Laughter was definitely a bridge that helped us reconnect and made us feel closer and more connected than ever. It was a reminder that we would always be the best of friends no matter how much time passed.
