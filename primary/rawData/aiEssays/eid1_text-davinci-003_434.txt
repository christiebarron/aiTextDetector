Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on humanity and to persuade readers to agree with me. The use of computers has become so ubiquitous that it affects almost all aspects of our lives, providing us with a wealth of knowledge and tools that have increased our efficiency and productivity.

From a professional standpoint, computers have enabled us to communicate effectively and quickly. We no longer have to wait for a response from a distant source for hours but can now send and receive messages within minutes, allowing work to be done in record time. Furthermore, the internet has united us in ways unimaginable, providing us with a treasure trove of information accessible from the comfort of our homes.

On the other hand, itâ€™s undeniable that computers have caused the human race to become more sedentary. With our bodies becoming increasingly dependent on computers and devices, the physical toll has been immense and the inactivity has caused declines in overall health. 

Therefore, I believe that we must find a balance between using computers for their beneficial purposes and also getting up and moving. By doing this, we can unlock the potential of our machines and benefit from a world where humanity and technology are in harmony.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
