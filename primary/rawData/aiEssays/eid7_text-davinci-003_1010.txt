 

I was at the park with my family one summer evening. We were there to have dinner and enjoy the sunset. Everything was going smoothly until a large flock of geese began to land in the field nearby. My children were excited to see the birds and ran off to take a closer look.

As they were running, one of them slipped and fell on the ground, scraped her knee, and began to cry. I was so tempted to lose my temper and yell at my child, but I knew that wouldn't help the situation at all. Instead, I kept my cool and calmly helped my child to her feet. I ran my fingers through her hair and comforted her, reassuring her that everything was going to be alright.

As we walked back towards the picnic area, I noticed that my patience had paid off. My daughter was no longer crying and was instead pointing out different birds and jumping with joy to see them all around her. That moment made me proud because I had put my own feelings aside and done what was best for my child. Being patient teaches us to practice understanding and tolerance, and I was happy that I was able to demonstrate that emotion with my family that day.
