I was out for a run with my friend one day when we ended up near a playground. We had been joking around most of the day so I thought it would be funny to "play" on the swing. 

So I hopped on the swing and, as I started pumping my legs, all I could think about was how silly I must have looked swinging at my age. I knew my friend was watching me, so I decided to start singing "The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round" at the top of my lungs. 

That's when I heard my friend burst out laughing. I hadn't noticed that some of the kids at the playground had paused their games to watch me and most of them were snickering, too. 

It was that moment that I realized how laughter has the power to bring people together. I could tell by the way my friend was laughing that he thought it was hilarious that I would be so silly, and I was happy that I had made him laugh. We continued talking and we even got some of the kids at the playground to join in our laughter and fun. 

It's funny to think that the most meaningful moment I had that day was the result of something so silly. But I guess that's the power of laughter and how it can bring out the best in people.
