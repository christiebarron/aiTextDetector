Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the various effects that computers have had on people in recent years. It is my belief that computers and the advances in technology associated with them have had only positive effects for most people.

First, computers have enabled greater opportunities for communication. From emails to social media, to video conferencing, computers have made it so much easier for people to connect with others who are near and far away. This has made our world a much more interconnected place and has opened doors for people to connect across cultures, borders and seas, something that wasn't possible before computers.

Second, the use of computers has significantly increased the efficiency with which people can carry out their daily tasks and projects. From tracking expenses to coordinating complex projects that require data input and analysis, computers have revolutionized the speed and accuracy with which information is gathered and processed.

Finally, computers have enabled access to an unimaginable amount of knowledge. Whether it is a medical condition, international politics or any other kind of information, computers have allowed us to reach levels of knowledge that a few generations ago would have taken years of research or would have been unavailable altogether.

For these reasons, I believe that computers have had overwhelmingly positive effects on people. I am confident that the readers of this newspaper will agree.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
