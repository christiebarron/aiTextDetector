The Empire State Building was constructed in the early 1930s, at the height of dirigible travel. As a result, one of the most unique and daring aspects of the building was its inclusion of a docking mast for these airships. Despite the boldness of this decision, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of challenging obstacles to make this dream a reality. 

The most prominent obstacle was the mechanics of the mast itself. The “Mooring Mast”, as it came to be known, was designed to be a single central mast with cables running up to the peak floor of the Empire State Building. Its dimensions needed to be exact in order to ensure the dirigible could land safely, and its construction required strict adherence to a complex process. In addition to this technical challenge, the mast itself needed to be constructed atop the building, posing another level of difficulty to the engineers.

Another obstacle presented was the unruly New York weather. High winds were naturally a major concern for a hulking airship, and Gusty winds in the cities of New York posed a major threat to any would-be moorers. Furthermore, the thick fog that sometimes graced the cities skyline could render flying a dangerous challenge. Testing the winds, temperatures and wind directions at the peak of the Empire State Building had to be done to calculate safe landing times. 

Finally, as ample security around the building and landing area was key, a variety of security protocols were put in place. This ensured the safety of the crew and passengers, and running such safety standards conveyed its own wealth of issues.
