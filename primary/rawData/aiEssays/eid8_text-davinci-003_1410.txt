My family was always so serious, it seemed like the only time anyone laughed was when we were making fun of each other at dinner. That all changed on Christmas morning when I was a kid.

My siblings and I woke up early, but it seemed like Christmas would never come. Finally, my parents said we were allowed to open our presents. We all rushed to the Christmas tree and started tearing away the wrapping paper with what seemed like lightning speed.

The funny thing was, none of us had any clue what we were opening; my parents had done a great job of wrapping everything in plain paper, so it was a guessing game. One by one, everything revealed it's contents and we were all so surprised.

That's when the laughter began. Everywhere I turned I saw a big smile and lots of chuckling. My brother received a pair of Christmas chickens and was absolutely delighted. My sister got a special edition Barbie that she's been wanting for ages. The reality and surprise of what was under the wrapping paper made us all laugh and it felt so amazing.

We joked about our presents and about how funny it was that we had no idea what we were getting. The laughter continued for the rest of the morning and we all enjoyed the moment together.

It's been years since that Christmas, but I still feel the warmth when I think of that joyful morning and the laughter that filled our home.
