I was recently at a get-together with all of my closest friends, and we were just lounging all around the room, catching up. We were all talking and laughing when suddenly my friend, who happened to be a little bit on the nervous side, cracked a joke that didn’t go over too well. The whole room became silent and everyone just stared at her.

But ever the optimist, I saw this as an opportunity to show my support. I smiled and laughed, and soon everyone else started to join in, until the whole room was in hysterics. Even my friend who had made the joke was laughing.

It was such a simple moment, but it felt so powerful to take the initiative and make sure no one felt left out. I know that the moment won’t alter the course of history, but it definitely left an impression on me. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
