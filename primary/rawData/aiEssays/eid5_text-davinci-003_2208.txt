Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, is an exploration of identity, memory, and culture. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez has a specific mood that he creates and engages with his readers.

The mood of the memoir is nostalgic, melancholic and thoughtful. Rodriguez tells stories of his upbringing in New Jersey and his visits to his parents' ancestral homes in Puerto Rico, and shares deeply personal moments, such as the moment he leaves home to pursue his dreams on a scholarship to Parsons. Each story is filled with emotion and vivid description. From the moments that he remembers his grandmother telling him stories in Puerto Rico to the days of teenage angst and crushing over “the boy down the block,” these moments are captured with a nostalgic, melancholic and thoughtful tone.

The mood that Rodriguez creates in his memoir reflects the duality of his life, from the past to the present, from the security of the home he was born into to the unfamiliarity of the home he has created for himself in fashion design and New York City. Rodriguez captures the complexities of his experience, from the lighter moments to the darker ones, with a thoughtful nostalgia. He also celebrates the joy of memories and of embracing his own history and heritage.

This nostalgic, melancholic, and thoughtful mood sets the tone for the memoir and creates an experience that is both familiar and unique. Rodriguez's memoir is not only an exploration of his life and identity, but also an exploration of emotion and memory, and how they can build a foundation of understanding and appreciation of our own lives.
