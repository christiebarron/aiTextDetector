I was caught in a moment of intense belly laughter with my friend. We had been out all day running errands in the hot afternoon sun and had decided to take a break and enjoy some lunch at a nearby cafe. As we waited for our food to arrive, the conversation naturally drifted towards the current happenings of our lives. We were chatting away, sharing stories of our recent successes and failures, when suddenly a quote from a show we both loved began to flash through my mind. I started to recite it, and as soon as my friend recognized it, we both burst out into laughter.

The well-timed joke served as a release for all the stress of the day, and for a few moments, our cafe felt like the only place in the world. Our laughs were contagious and soon people at the other tables were joining in the joy. Even the waitstaff standing behind the counter could not help but smile as they watched us continue to giggle into our coffees. Laughing together in that moment reminded us why we had been friends for so many years - we share a creative bond as well as a strong friendship.

The five minutes we spent laughing together had managed to do what hours of deep conversation could not - it had brought us closer than ever before, and we both knew that this moment between us would never be forgotten.
