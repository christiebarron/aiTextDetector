Narciso Rodriguez's memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' is an autobiographical exploration of his journey from his Cuban-American roots to his successful life as a fashion designer. The time and place of his upbringing are captured vividly, and it is this vividness that creates the unforgettable mood of the memoir.

From the opening chapter, a melancholic tone is established through Rodriguez's account of his disorienting move from the heat and energy of his beloved Miami to a cold and quiet town in New Jersey. The emotions of the young Narciso, torn away from his Cuban heritage and his Cuban American childhood friends, are presented extremely well and make the reader acutely aware of his struggles and his experiences of culture shock.

As the memoir progresses, we are given an insight into Rodriguez's home life as his story moves between its influences and its effects on his sense of identity. The warmth in the conversations between Rodriguez and his parents are very real and palpable and make the reader feel a part of the family in the same way that Rodriguez was a part of it himself. These moments of intimacy contrasted with the wooden chill of the New Jersey winter and the dryness of the desert in the desert outside of Las Vegas are vividly evoked.

The mood of Rodriguez's story is unique and moving and takes us on an inward journey for culture shock and loss of identity. These raw emotions make the reader uncomfortable but also compel us to keep on reading and feeling. Through his anecdotal experience, he empowers us to confront our own sense of heritage, identity and belonging. These are all themes found in his memoir that
