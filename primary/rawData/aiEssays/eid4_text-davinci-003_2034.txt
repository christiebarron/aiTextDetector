The ending of Minfong Ho's poem, “Winter Hibiscus”, implies hope. In the poem, the narrator sees a hibiscus flower that's blooming in the cold winter season, discussing the difficulty of making something grow when the conditions around it aren't exactly ideal. By ending the poem with “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, Ho adds a hopeful note - the narrator is hopeful that they will prevail despite the odds.

The imagery of the poem also adds to the hope. The return of the geese and animals in the spring, the melting of snow and the budding of the hibiscus flower signify renewal and a fresh start. The narrator is encouraged by the resilience of the hibiscus and the promises of a new season, knowing that if the flower can bloom against all odds, then so can they.

Additionally, it’s clear that the “test” being referred to in the poem is less about a literal test, and more about the challenge of life. The narrator is hopeful that when faced with the same challenge again, things will be different because of the changes that occur over time. In the same way that nature transitions from season to season, the narrator is hopeful that they will be able to adjust and grow, too.

The combination of imagery and hope make the ending of the poem powerful and important. It speaks to the idea that no matter what obstacles we face
