I was working a busy shift as a cashier at the local grocery store when an elderly woman stepped up to my register with her items. As soon as she began to unload her groceries, she apologised for the amount of items she had. She went on to explain that she was on a very tight budget and had been clipping coupons for weeks to make her money stretch.

I could tell she was embarrassed and offered her a reassuring smile. I told her that it was no problem and that I was happy to check her out. She thanked me, but then asked if I could check 48 items out of the 50 she had, as she realised that that she had inadvertently missed her coupon for two of them. 

I could see she was feeling discouraged, so I smiled and told her it would be no problem. I explained that it's been a slow day and I was able to get her all fifty items at the discounted rate. She thanked me with a twinkle in her eye and told me that she was grateful to see someone with patience these days. 

I watched her walk out with a renewed pep in her step, and it filled me with a sense of satisfaction that I had been able to help her. Being patient with her had resulted in a moment of kindness that put a smile on our faces both.
