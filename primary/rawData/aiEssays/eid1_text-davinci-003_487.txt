Dear Editor, 

In today's world, it is hard to deny the profound effect that computers have on people's lives. The proliferation of these gadgets has produced a seismic shift in how people communicate, work, and conduct business. Despite the wide-reaching benefits that can come from computers, there are also potential pitfalls associated with their usage.

It is no secret that computers can have a negative impact on people's social lives. Those who spend too much time in front of the screen may find themselves with strained relationships and miss out on meaningful face-to-face interactions. Additionally, it is important to remember that technology can breed unhealthy habits, including addiction, which can lead to further problems in people's lives.

Still, computers have their advantages. They can provide people with an unparalleled level of convenience, efficiency and even productivity, especially when it comes to accessing information or completing a task. Computers are also a great way for people to connect with others, allowing for the sharing of a variety of material, from music and videos to photos and ideas.

In the end, it is easy to see the double-edged sword of computers and their effect on people. While care must be taken to ensure that usage does not spiral out of control, their influence should not be downplayed. Whether computers are used for entertainment, work, or interpersonal communication, their contribution to our society should not be underestimated.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
