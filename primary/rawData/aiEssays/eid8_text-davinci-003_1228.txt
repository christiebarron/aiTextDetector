I remember one of the funniest moments with my partner. We had been out for dinner and were on our way home. I had made a joke about us getting lost and he laughed it off. We had been walking in circles for quite some time and then, just as we were about to give up, we suddenly saw the familiar sight of our road. We both laughed in relief, holding onto each other as if to save ourselves from falling over in a fit of laughter. We made it home and that moment of shared laughter was the sweetest thing ever. Even during our toughest times, I can still remember that silly moment of shared laughter and how much it meant to us. Laughter is indeed the best medicine, and it certainly creates the shortest distance between two people.
