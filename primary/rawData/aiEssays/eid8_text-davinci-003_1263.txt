I was on a date with a guy I'd been seeing for a while, and I hadn't managed to get a laugh out of him the whole night. I'd tried cracking jokes and telling funny stories, but it just seemed like he was never going to crack a smile. 

Finally, I decided to take a leap of faith and tell him a story that my grandmother had once told me. It was an old family joke, the kind of thing you can only appreciate if you know the family's background. I could tell he didn't even know what to expect, but I went ahead and told him the story anyway.

Sure enough, as soon as I told him the punchline, he broke out into uncontrollable laughter. He was laughing so hard that he had tears streaming down his face. I couldn't help but laugh along with him. 

Just seeing him laugh was enough to let me know that we had a connection. It was a moment I will never forget, and it's something that we laugh about to this day.
