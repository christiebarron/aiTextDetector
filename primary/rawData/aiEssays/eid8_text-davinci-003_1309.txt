My sister and I have always been very close. We were always there for each other in tough times and we could always count on each other for a good laugh. 

One day, she came to visit me and we decided to catch up over lunch. We decided to go for burgers. We were chatting about our days and catching up on everything that had happened since we last saw each other when I made a joke about my recent break-up. I expected my sister to laugh, but her face suddenly turned serious and she said, "That's not funny." 

At first, I was taken aback and embarrassed, but I quickly began to laugh. She joined in soon enough, but it was the kind of laughter that was more embarrassed than joyful. We both knew the joke was a little tacky, but in that moment, it was the kind of laughter that brought us even closer. 

Laughter has always been an important part of our relationship, and it's one of the things that make us so close. Whether it's a polite giggle at a cheesy joke, or a genuine guffaw that brings tears to our eyes, it's these moments of shared joy that bring us closer together and remind us that family is the most important thing.
