The setting of the story 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski plays an important role in the cyclist's journey. The obstacles that the cyclist encounters on his journey contribute to the overall tone of the story.

The cyclist moves through a rural landscape with roads and trails through the woods. This creates an atmosphere of isolation, reflecting the cyclist's personal struggle. Although he is travelling on established roads and paths, the cyclist is ultimately alone in his quest and the surrounding environment reinforces this feeling. The roads are old and the signage is limited, leaving the cyclist perpetually uncertain about where he is headed. The cyclist must rely on himself, his wits and strength, to get wherever he is going. 

The journey is made both more daunting and more rewarding by the lack of modern amenities that would normally be encountered in a busier and more accessible terrain. There are no cars on the roads, no stores or towns. Instead, the cyclist encounters farms, streams, rivers and other natural features of a rural terrain. As the cyclist cycles further off the beaten path, road surfaces become rougher, hills steeper and wider rivers crossed more often. These more isolated sections of the journey place a stronger emphasis on endurance and
