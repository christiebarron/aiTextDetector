Dear Editor,

The debate over censorship in libraries has long been a contentious issue. On one side are those who argue that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be made available if they are considered offensive or inappropriate. However, on the other side are those who believe that censorship in libraries violate our rights as citizens to access whatever information we choose to access.

There are strong arguments in both cases and it is important to consider them both thoughtfully. On the one hand, some materials may be considered offensive and inappropriate, and the vulnerable members of society have the right to be protected from such materials. Removing them from libraries is a way of safeguarding their interests. On the other hand, censorship in libraries also restricts our rights to access information that we would be allowed to access if it was not censored. The freedom of speech is an important right and censorship seeks to limit it.

In my view, censorship in libraries should not take place. We should allow access to all materials, no matter how offensive or inappropriate, as long as they are not illegal. We should facilitate an open and informed society by making the information available and let the public decide how to interpret it. For example, libraries could provide parent guides and age ratings to materials, to help parents make educated decisions, rather than making the decision for them.

If we want to empower individuals and maximize their freedom, censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Let us make all materials available and trust that individuals can make the informed choices that are best for them and their families.

Sincerely,
