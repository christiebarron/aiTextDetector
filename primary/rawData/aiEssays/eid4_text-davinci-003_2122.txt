The ending of Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” is significant because it encapsulates an important theme of resilience found throughout the poem. By depicting the winter hibiscus surviving the harsh conditions of winter, the protagonist is able to reflect on their own experiences. The winter hibiscus serves as an example of the speaker’s fortitude in the face of adversity.

The speaker of the poem is an immigrant student taking a citizenship test, a test that is emotionally taxing due to the fact that it is shrouded in doubt and fear. By paralleling the struggle of the winter hibiscus to their own everyday struggle, it allows the speaker to gain a sense of reassuring strength. At the same time, it also serves to put their own struggles in perspective by showing them that they can withstand what is being asked of them in the same way that the hibiscus survived winter. 

The winter hibiscus stands as a beacon of hope for the protagonist, an example of renewal and resilience in the face of difficult circumstances. After watching the winter hibiscus survive, the speaker is further encouraged to take the citizenship test again when the snows melt in the spring. Thus, the notion of hope is ultimately embodied by the winter hibiscus and the eventual comeback it will have when spring arrives. Although the speaker may have doubts and fears in their own life, they can take comfort in the idea that they, like the flower, will have their moment of renewal as well.
