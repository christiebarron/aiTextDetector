I was recently volunteering in my local library and had the pleasure of interacting with many different people. One day, I encountered an older woman who was struggling to use the computer. I noticed she was attempting to use the machine for a lengthy amount of time, visibly becoming frustrated. I approached her and asked if she needed help. She initially declined, but I persisted and gently offered to help. I expected her to become frustrated with me, however she was pleasantly surprised. She explained that she was trying to complete her taxes and was having a lot of difficulty. I patiently showed her how to navigate the website and complete the necessary forms. Although it took some time, she seemed grateful for the help, and I felt good knowing I was able to make a difference.
