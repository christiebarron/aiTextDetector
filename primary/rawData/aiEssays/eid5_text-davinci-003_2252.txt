The memoir "From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" by Narciso Rodriguez is a deeply emotive and personal account of Rodriguez's biographical journey. Rodriguez's memoir captures the mood of a man who both clings to the memory of his late mother and is able to reflect on her influence in his later success as a fashion designer. As Rodriguez explores his identity and talent, he does so with an underlying tone of melancholy and nostalgia.

The memoir paints a vivid picture of Rodriguez's childhood in a tight knit community of mainly Cuban refugees in New Jersey. Through describing the many facets of his upbringing, from meals shared with extended family to nights spent attending church functions, it is easy to draw comparisons to a joyous, innocent epoch. This feeling of nostalgia and security is imbued throughout the entire work, allowing for a nostalgic and comforting atmosphere that persists despite some painful memories Rodriguez outlines.

The memoir goes on to detail Rodriguez's career path and how his mother's commitment to her family and to the Catholic Church informed his own artistic impulses. Again, the tone here is one of both appreciation and sadness as Rodriguez looks back at a life now gone. The author's ability to revisit those memories with warmth and emotion provides a mood of appreciation and reverence that drives the narrative.

The mood created within this memoir is ultimately one of hope, remembrance and appreciation. It is a testament to the power of our stories and emotions and the influence a loving mother can have on the
