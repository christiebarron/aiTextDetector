I recently had the pleasure of spending time with my dear grandmother. She's 98 years old and has been living alone since my grandfather passed away a few years ago. 

One day, when I was visiting her, I noticed she had a large pile of mail she hadn't opened yet. She mentioned she was having difficulties with opening some of the envelopes, so I offered to help her. As I started to open the mail, I was taken aback by the sheer number of letters and bills. It became clear that the task was going to take me much longer than I had anticipated.

My grandmother, however, remained patient and calm the entire time. She even thanked me for helping her out and told me she was proud of me for being so helpful and understanding. Her stoic patience was particularly noteworthy considering the magnitude of the task. 

I'm always amazed by my grandmother's zen-like nature and how easily she remains steady through difficult situations. Her patience is a quality I truly admire and one that I hope to emulate in my own life.
