I recently had to go to the DMV to register my car. I arrived early, expecting a long wait in line. But I was pleasantly surprised when the wait was only about 30 minutesâ€”all the tips I read about going early really paid off! 

When I made it to the front of the line, I was met with a very grumpy clerk. He was obviously having a bad day and was scolding people for the smallest mistakes. After my turn came, I quickly realized that I did not have the right documents and had to wait in line once again. 

I was ready to lose my patience and leave, but I decided to take a deep breath and stay put. I knew it was out of my control and it was not the clerks' fault, so there was no point in getting angry. I was able to stay focused and finally, after what felt like an eternity, made it back to the front of the line. This time I was prepared with the right documents so I was able to finally get my car registered. 

As I left the DMV, I was proud of myself for practicing patience during a difficult situation. It paid off in the end and I actually experienced a positive outcome.
