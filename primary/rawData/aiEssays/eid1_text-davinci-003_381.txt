Dear Editor,

I'm writing today to express my opinion on the impact computers have had on society, and why I think that the effects have been largely positive.

It's undeniable that computers have shaped the way we interact and get things done. We can quickly and easily store and access information all around the world. Business is also changing as a consequence, with automation and artificial intelligence taking an increasingly prominent role in our lives.

However, I stand by the belief that these changes have largely been positive ones. With computers, we have more opportunities to connect with people globally, thereby widening our education, business, social and political perspectives. We are also given more freedom and flexibility to complete a wide range of tasks in more efficient and productive ways. 

I'm confident that this will continue to be the case as technology advances and more of the world's population is given access to computers. The potential for computers to unlock positive transformation is immense and I am sympathetic to the idea that most people are better off with the presence of computers in their lives.

It's clear that computers have had far-reaching implications, and I firmly believe that the majority of them have been beneficial. 

Thank you for your time, 

[Your Name]
