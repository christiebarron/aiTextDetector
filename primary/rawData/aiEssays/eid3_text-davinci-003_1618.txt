In Joe Kurmaski's story, "Rough Road Ahead," the story's setting plays a pivotal role in shaping the cyclist's experience. 

For example, the cyclist embarks on her journey on a rather untried, uncharted road and finds herself in the middle of a desert, surrounded by a dry, empty landscape with almost no signs of human life. This desolation provides a sense of isolation and fear, heightening the uneasiness felt by the cyclist as she cycles on, uncertain of her future. 

The cyclist is further disoriented by the eerie silence that permeates the area; the lack of sound and life make her hyper-aware of her vulnerability, which brings both fear and a sense of courage. As she continues on her journey, she finds herself surrounded by an intense heat, reflecting the sun and stressing her body. 

The cyclist also has to contend with the more subtle aspects of the setting, such as the inclines and declines of the terrain and the randomly placed stones, making for an unpredictable and difficult ride. It is difficult for the cyclist to make forward progress, as she must contend with the uneven terrain and sudden changes in the road.
