 

In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the main character is a cyclist who must traverse a winding and dangerous mountain road in order to reach his destination. The setting of the story is crucial to the cyclist’s journey because it features elements that directly affect his safety and success on the road.

The most important feature of the setting is the winding and treacherous mountain road. This steep terrain is filled with steep descents and sharp curves that make it difficult for the cyclist to remain in control of his bike and prevent him from going too fast. Additionally, the rocky terrain of the mountain makes it difficult for the cyclist to find a stable footing. This makes it difficult for him to brake and steer, leading to potential disaster if he is not careful. 

The road is also lined with thick brush and looming trees that further restrict the cyclist’s visibility and make it difficult to see potential obstacles in his way. As if this were not enough, the cyclist must contend with rain potentially making the road slippery, increasing his risk of slipping and falling even further. 

Overall, the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” affects the cyclist’s journey
