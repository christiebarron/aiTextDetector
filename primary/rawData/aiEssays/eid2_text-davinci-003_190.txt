Censorship in libraries has always been a heated topic of debate. There are those who argue that libraries should have free rein to stock whatever materials they deem worthy and necessary, while others feel that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. 

It is true that libraries, being public institutions, have a responsibility to protect their civil patrons from offensive materials, but it is equally true that censoring materials can have far-reaching implications. After all, the history of this country has taught us the dangers of censorshipâ€”from the censorship of the Hays Code in Hollywood to the book-burning of Nazi Germany. 

Moreover, it is not always clear cut when it comes to determining which materials are offensive. For example, a classic book like The Catcher in the Rye may be seen as blasphemous by some while lauded by others as an revolutionary piece of literature. This only serves to prove that what one deems offensive may not be seen as such by someone else. The idea of state-enforced censorship is tainted by the difficulty in drawing an objective line between what is and what is not offensive.

I believe that libraries should be neither favorable nor prejudice against any particular type of material. Instead the staff should be active and mindful in providing patrons a wide range of material and making sure to provide information that is accessible and comprehensive. Libraries should use their expertise to predict and be informed about what materials may constitute a breach in common decency and which is not. Age appropriateness is key as well and that should also be taken into consideration.

Censorship in libraries should remain
