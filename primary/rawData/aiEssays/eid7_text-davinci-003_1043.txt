I remember the time my grandma was diagnosed with cancer. I had never felt so much grief in my life before. Even though the news was devastating, my granddad remained patient. Despite the fact that they were both scared, he took care of her and supported her treatments. He knew that she needed to stay strong to make it through this difficult time and he was determined to be with her every step of the way. 

When Grandma's condition worsened, Granddad stayed by her side through every hospital visit. He was calm and supportive, encouraging her to keep going no matter how hard things got. Even when the doctors gave us pessimistic news, he pushed on with optimism and faith. In the end, he was there until the very end, and I was so grateful for his strength. His patience and dedication gave us hope and courage during a very difficult time.
