The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski consists of a cyclist pedaling in a nice rural area. The setting of this story has a lot of influence on the experience and situation of the cyclist. 

The rural setting is peaceful and quiet, allowing the cyclist to have time to process his thoughts and emotions. This gives him the time to feel his embarrassment and remorse for his actions and thoughts that led to him being in this predicament in the first place. It also gives him time to make good decisions, like deciding to find a new route after he comes to understand the road ahead is too rough.

The rural setting also makes the cyclist feel more connected to the nature around him. He pays special attention to the trees and animals and finds solace in their inability to judge or criticize him. The natural environment grants him a safe and comforting place to figure out how to maneuver the bumpy road ahead.

Finally, the rural setting helps the cyclist better appreciate his roles and responsibilities as a cyclist on the road. His respect for the environment around him increases and he comes to realize that a large part of his job is making sure he isn't damaging the roads or environment as he travels
