I was out grocery shopping one day and the store was very busy. I was standing in line with my two full shopping baskets and the line was not moving. There were a lot of people in line and everyone was getting very impatient and vocalizing their frustrations. 

I, on the other hand, remained calm and patient. I took deep breaths and told myself not to stress out. I understood that the store was busy and the line was moving as fast as it could. 

To my surprise, the customer in front of me suddenly noticed my patience and understanding. She asked me, "How can you remain so patient in all this craziness?" I simply told her that I just gave myself time to relax and understand that these types of situations are usually unavoidable. With a big smile, she thanked me for my understanding and we continued with our shopping. In the end, my patience paid off and we were able to checkout and leave the store without any drama.
