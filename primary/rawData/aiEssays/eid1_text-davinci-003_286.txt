Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people in our society. Technology has become unimaginably advanced over the last few decades, and computers have become an integral part of our lives. In my opinion, computers have done a great deal to help and benefit us. 

For starters, computers help us remain connected. Through social media and instant messaging, people can collaborate, connect, and communicate with friends and family from around the world. Computers have a number of features that have made work and studying easier. The use of technology has enabled faster and more interactive learning. 

Computers have also made countless aspects of life easier. We can now find quick answers to our queries, research different topics, and use the internet to shop for all sorts of goods. We are also able to access many services from the comfort of our homes.

Furthermore, computers are a source of entertainment. With their capabilities and processing power, computers can provide us with music, movies, games, and other forms of entertainment that can bring joy and keep us entertained.

In conclusion, computers have enabled us to improve our day-to-day lives and become more productive in our tasks. Through the use of computers, we can create, learn, and inspire each other. I strongly believe that the effects that computers have had on people are positive and I urge you to agree.

Thank you for your time and consideration
