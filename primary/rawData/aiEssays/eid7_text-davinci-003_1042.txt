I remember a time when I had to be especially patient. I was waiting for a table at a restaurant that was extremely crowded. We had been waiting for almost an hour, and I could feel my patience wearing thin. I was ready to find somewhere else to eat, but my friend wanted to stay, so I kept my cool and waited. 

Finally, I saw our name being called. I was so relieved! We were seated and offered some complimentary starters due to the wait. I was grateful for the patience I had and decided to stay for the meal. It was worth the wait.
