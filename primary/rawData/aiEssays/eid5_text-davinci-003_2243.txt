Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a mood of nostalgia as he recounts his upbringing in New Jersey. Through anecdotes and vivid descriptions, Rodriguez invites readers to join him in a journey to his childhood home.

Rodriguez paints a vivid picture of his youth, recalling the textures and scents of his family home and the particularities of his life there. Through this nostalgia, he allows readers to become acquainted with the people and places of his past. His descriptions often evoke a sense of comfort, as he reflects on his mother's cooking and his father's gentle spirit: “he stayed in the background, until my mother passed away, always influencing us and guiding us through life.” 

At the same time, the memoir conveys a deep sense of anguish and loss. The death of his mother becomes a recurrent subject, and even when revisiting fond memories of his childhood home, there is an undeniable sense of mourning in his writing. The story's nostalgia has a bittersweet sentiment — a reminder of the beauty of memories, past experiences, and loved ones, but also of what has been lost.

The conversational style of Rodriguez's prose gives insight into his innermost thoughts and feelings, and his words radiate a warm, intimate vibe. Rodriguez invites readers to dive into his memory with him, and it is through his vulnerability that true understanding is found. Ultimately, From Home conveys a feeling of deep empathy, love, and acceptance — a powerful emotion that can be shared by many.
