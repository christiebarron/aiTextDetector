The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski impacts the cyclist’s experience in multiple ways. The setting is a rough road, full of hairpin turns, sharp curves, and steep grades. This makes for a challenging and difficult ride for the cyclist. They must constantly adjust their speed and maneuver around obstacles in order to continue forward. The cyclist is also confronted with harsh weather conditions, such as strong winds, rain, and snow, which can make the journey even more difficult. 

The environment of the road also affects the cyclist’s emotional state. With a rough road and horrible conditions, it’s easy to become discouraged and overwhelmed. The cyclist is constantly pushed to the brink of their endurance, and the sense of accomplishment they feel after a successful ride may be their only reward. 

The cyclist also finds inspiration in the setting. The fear they feel and challenging course sparks a determination to power through. The cyclist is also reminded of the importance of perseverance. They see that every obstacle can be overcome if they have the courage to face it head on. Through the experience, the cyclist finds a renewed spirit and deeper appreciation for life.
