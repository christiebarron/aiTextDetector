Censorship in libraries has become a highly contested issue. Nevertheless, I believe it is necessary in some cases. Libraries are our societyâ€™s most valuable resource for accessing information, and as such, they should be respected and kept safe for everyone. 

Some believe that all materials, regardless of how disturbing or objectionable, should remain in libraries. However, I believe that certain works should not be accessible to the public. We should not be exposing impressionable young children, or even adults, to inappropriate materials. 

Evidence of what happens when materials are not censored shows that it can have a negative effect on the mental health of vulnerable individuals. A study by the Federal Communications Commission concluded that explicit material that can be accessed through libraries can cause feelings of distress or distress in those exposed to it. The same is true of literature and cinema.

It is therefore important to protect libraries from this kind of material to ensure that they remain a safe and inviting space for all. If a book, movie, or any other medium is found to be offensive, then it should be removed from the shelves. This does not mean that it has to be completely destroyed or banned though. It should be made available to those who wish to access it, through special permissions and screenings.

Libraries are an important part of our culture and should be preserved for everyone to enjoy. Censorship of certain materials ensures that their contents remain appropriate and acceptable for the general public to access.
