I remember a time when my son was going through a difficult phase. He was refusing to listen to me and I could see him becoming increasingly frustrated. I worried for his well being and didn't want to punish him for his actions, so instead I tried to be patient and understanding.

I spent more time with him, cuddling with him and just listening. I also tried to talk to him calmly and let him know it was ok to feel frustrated - I suggested that he might want to try talking about it. He eventually calmed down and we worked through his difficulties together.

Seeing him happy again was a relief, and it was a reminder of the importance of patience. With patience, I'd been able to reach him and help him work through his problems in a positive way, without resorting to punishment.
