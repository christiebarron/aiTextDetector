I used to volunteer in a soup kitchen once a week. One day, we had an elderly guest who had trouble walking and speaking. He looked a bit disoriented and confused. As I was helping him get a tray of food, it was clear he wasn't able to carry it on his own. Even though helping him slowed me down, I kept my cool and was patient with him. I made sure he was comfortable and was able to get his food without any issues.

Even though there was a line of other people waiting to be served, I made sure the elderly guest was taken care of without rushing him. I asked him questions, such as what his favorite food was and if anything else I could help him with. He was grateful for my support and it was a pleasure for me to help him out. In the end, he got his tray of food and thanked me for my patience.
