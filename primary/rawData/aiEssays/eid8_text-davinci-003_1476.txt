I'm not sure how we met, but I do know how we got close. Initially, we were two strangers, cautiously sizing each other up, trying to find some common ground. But then came the laughter.

It started out as a simple joke between us, but then it turned into something else. We both had silly laughs that could brighten up any room. We found common ground outside of our usual discussions and it felt like a shared bond between us. It was the first time we connected on something more than just the surface level conversations.

We started to realize that the time we spent together was the time we laughed the hardest. We shared more than just jokes, we shared laughter. We laughed at our own blunders, we laughed at one another's quirks, and most importantly, we laughed at the most ridiculous things. 

No matter how many arguments we had, how many differences we had, there was always laughter to bridge the gap. We laughed our way through the hardest times, and it always put us back on the same page.

Laughter became a regular occurrence for us. Whether it was the long conversations we had or the spontaneous moments of joy, our relationship was filled with laughter. We found out that it was the easiest way to connect with one another and it made us even closer.

At the end of the day, laughter was always the missing piece. It was the thing we needed to keep our relationship strong and healthy. We both realized that with laughter, we could keep the connection between us alive and going.
