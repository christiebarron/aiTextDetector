I used to work as a tutor for a high school student who was struggling to understand the material. He was a junior and had had a really tough year. Even though it took a lot of effort and time, I was patient with him and careful to communicate to him in a way that didn't make him feel overwhelmed. 

It was a long process, but eventually he started to understand the key concepts and was actually even answering questions correctly before I could even finish explaining them. There were times when my patience was stretched thin and I wanted to give up and move on, but I knew that if I really cared about the student, I had to be patient and continue to support him no matter how long it took.

In the end, he not only passed the course but got an A on the final test and even thanked me for my patience and dedication. Seeing the progress he had made and the results of being patient with him was truly rewarding.
