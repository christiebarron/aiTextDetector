It was love at first sight. She walked into the room, and I looked into her eyes, and I just knew. 

Our chemistry was instant, and soon we were in each other’s company practically every evening. It was like we had known each other our entire lives. We would talk until the wee hours of the morning, discussing our dreams and aspirations. We laughed so much that everyone around us started to take notice, commenting that they had never seen two people have such a special connection. 

It felt like the world had stopped and the only thing that mattered was us. We joked and made fun of each other without any reservations. Of course, it was all in good fun. We teased one another about our quirks and habits, but at the same time we were admiring each other’s unique perspectives and ideas. 

As we continued to get to know each other, I realised how lucky I was to have found someone with such a good sense of humour. We were able to turn any situation into something funny and just enjoy life a little bit more. Whenever we were together, laughter was the only thing that mattered. 

For the first time in a long time, I felt truly happy. We’ve been together for almost a year now and life has been nothing but amazing. We’ve come to realise that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people, and that it’s the most important thing in any relationship.
