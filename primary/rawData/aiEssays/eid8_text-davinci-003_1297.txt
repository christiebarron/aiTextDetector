I was out on a date with my then-boyfriend when I decided to tell him the story of my first job interview. I had been so nervous, and although I wasn't sure if I had gotten the job, I had felt really confident about my performance... until I had said something mortifyingly embarrassing at the end. Immediately, I started to feel my face flush and my stomach drop.

However, instead of an awkward silence or a sympathetic look, my date started to laugh. We both started to laugh hysterically, and in that moment, my embarrassment was forgotten. We were just two people thoroughly enjoying each other's company, not one of us thinking about the blunder I had made. The shared laughter created a connection between us, and I felt like this was more than just a date - it was the start of something special. 

The story of my humiliation will forever be remembered between us â€“ not as a source of embarrassment, but rather as a reminder of how laughter can be the bridge between two people.
