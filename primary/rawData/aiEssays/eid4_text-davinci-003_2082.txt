The short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho follows a young narrator who finds solace in tending to a winter hibiscus plant. At the end of the story, the narrator is asked to take a standardized test, the results of which will determine which class he is placed in the upcoming school year. He declines to take the test and instead states, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Ho’s choice to end the story with these lines conveys the importance of the natural world in the development of the narrator’s identity.

In the story, the narrator finds himself at a crossroads between securing a high-class education, as exemplified by the standardized test he is asked to take, and embracing his true identity as a steward of nature. As the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, the narrator is symbolically released from this tension. In this moment, he is met with a certainty of the forces at work in the world that he cannot deny; it is an acceptance of his place in the cycle of seasons and the natural environment he inhabits. The change of season invites him to join the migratory geese, a sign from nature to follow his own dreams and be true to his inner voice. 

The growth of the hibiscus symbolizes the narrator’s own growth and his journeys towards self-discovery.
