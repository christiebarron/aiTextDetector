It was the middle of summer and I was visiting my great-grandma at the Care Home. As I walked down the hallway to her room, I heard the most joyous sound emanating from inside; it was my great-grandma and her friends laughing. As soon as I entered the room, they all stopped and looked at me. My great-grandma called me over and introduced her friends. We chatted for a while until one of them mentioned a funny story that had recently happened at the Care Home. Everyone couldn't help but laugh, including my great-grandma and I. It was a magical moment; all of us individuals connected by laughter. 

It felt like in a moment all the barriers of time, age and generation had been removed, allowing us to connect on a deeper level. When I left that day, I was filled with a feeling of joy that I had shared a moment of laughter with my great-grandma and her friends. It was a memory that I will always cherish and that I will never forget.
