The Empire State Building, located in New York City, is one of the most iconic buildings in the world, synonymous with modern architectural achievements. However, most people don't know that the original building was designed with the intent of allowing airships, more commonly referred to as dirigibles, to dock. Chief designer William F. Lamb envisioned a mooring mast that would stretch from the top of the skyscraper, providing a platform for dirigibles to rest at the building’s summit. Despite the ingenuity of the idea, the dream of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was not realized and the plans for the mooring mast were, for the most part, thrown away in the years shortly following the building’s opening. 

The main obstacle that Lamb and the other builders of the Empire State Building faced in making the mooring mast a reality was the technology available at the time. Dirigibles were still quite unreliable during the early 1930s, a problem that was best exemplified by the crash of the Hindenburg in 1937. The historical volatility of the dirigibles posed a considerable risk of sabotage, crash, and fire hazard. Consequently, the use of flammable hydrogen was the source of considerable apprehension, and the directors of the building were reluctant to alter even the air circulation in the building to accommodate the gas-filled creations. 

Additionally, the immense size of the building was a hindrance in making the mooring mast possible. Even if the builders had managed to bypass the technological issues posed by the dirigibles, the sheer instability of
