Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the effects of computers on society. With the advancement of technology and more access to computers, the impact of computer technology has increased significantly in recent years.

I believe that computers are a great tool for improving a person's overall productivity. The ability to access information quickly and easily allows a person to complete tasks faster than ever before. Computers provide an avenue to expand one's knowledge in various fields of study. This helps with problem-solving and creativity. Computers also provide an environment of collaboration, allowing people to connect with one another much easier than ever before.

On the other hand, computers also have a negative effect on society as well. The misuse of computers can lead to cyberbullying and an increase in conflict. It can also have an adverse effect on mental health, leading to an overreliance on technology and an increase in stress.

It is important to note that while computers have the potential to create both positive and negative effects, we must use them responsibly. We should take the opportunity to use computers to our advantage, but we must also be aware of the potential consequences that come with overusing technology. By being mindful of the impact of computers, we can maximize the potential benefits of technology and create a better society for ourselves and our peers.

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
