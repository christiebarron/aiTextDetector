I was at a grocery store with a long line and I was in a rush. I had been waiting in line for nearly 30 minutes when I finally heard the person ahead of me asking the cashier endless questions. They asked about brands, sizes, and prices, and seemed to be taking forever. I was annoyed, however I tried to remain patient. 

So, I decided to take a deep breath and count to 10, asking myself why getting angry would help the situation. I began to understand that maybe this person needed time to take their time with their decision, and I also needed to respect that. I also reminded myself that I was in no rush and that the person in front of me was just doing some grocery shopping.

By the end of the ordeal, I had been in line for almost an hour. However, because I was patient with the person ahead of me and I didnâ€™t rush them, I left the store feeling more relaxed and having done my part to maintain peace in the store.
