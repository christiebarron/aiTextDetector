The Empire State Building was a grand engineering feat of its time, but the ambitious engineering project of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock posed fines risks and unique challenges. As outlined in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, these obstacles included regulations, unfavorable weather and air traffic, weight of dirigibles, and safety concerns.

To begin, regulations were a major obstacle to constructing a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building. Per the International Air Navigation Convention, dirigibles were only allowed to dock at heights that were 200 feet lower than the tallest structure within five miles. Previously, the tallest structure within five miles of the Empire State Building had been the taller Woolworth Building, but for the purposes of accommodating dirigibles, the Chrysler Building, over 100 feet shorter, was heavily touted as a suitable alternative. Without an appropriate landing platform, dirigibles could not dock and the goal of constructing a mooring mast would be unreachable.

Weather was another formidable barrier. According to The Mooring Mast, a hard wind of 10 miles per hour was needed for dirigibles to ascend into the air, and a wind speed at least double the landing wind speed was needed to provide a safe descent. On days of unfavorable wind patterns, landing dirigibles would not be possible.

Additionally, air traffic was a major concern. Building a dock for dirigibles would require the support of two or three blimps that also needed to dodge conflicting air traffic. This meant that the dirigibles would need to make several stops en route of their destination, adding time and
