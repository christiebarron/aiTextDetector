The Empire State Building, completed in 1931 and standing at 443 meters, is considered by many to be a symbol of grandeur claiming unprecedented modern architecture. Initially, the builders of the Empire State Building had the ambitious task of including an airship docking mast, at the 80th floor, to accommodate large dirigibles, a type of airship.

Though this project was incredibly ambitious and exciting, it also presented a great number of obstacles. One of the largest of these was the size of the mooring mast, as dirigibles are known for their large wingspan. Engineers had to find a way to incorporate the mast into the building design and make sure it wasn't too big or too small for the dirigible to dock. This was a challenge since the mast had to be fit into the existing design, which already had an intricate structure of metal beams and concrete. Moreover, the mast had to support the extreme weight of the dirigibles and withstand the strain of them connecting it to the airship.

Climate was also a concern for the builders since the extreme weather patterns in New York City were expected to take a toll on the metal mast. For example, high winds and precipitation could lead to rusting and other damage. The engineers had to ensure the integrity of the mast by devising a metal shield that could protect the mast from rain and other elements.

The engineers also had to think of the safety of the public and that of the dirigible passengers and crew. An additional issue that arose in the construction of the mast was creating safety measures so the dirigibles would not pose a risk
