In the modern world of virtual reality, online streaming, and magazines galore, it may seem that libraries are a relic of days gone by. But the truth is, libraries remain essential to many in the community, offering a space of reflection, learning and entertainment. Unfortunately, some libraries have responded to modern society’s changing views with censorship of their materials. 

We must look to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which guarantees us as citizens the right to freedom of speech and expression. Censoring materials in a public library goes against these basic rights. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, even if it is not widely shared, and the same should be applied to the materials in our libraries. It is not the job of library staff to force morality onto the patrons by deciding which materials should remain on the shelves. 

Furthermore, censorship does little to protect those that it is meant to safeguard. Parents can act as a proper filter when it comes to what their children should or shouldn’t be exposed to. Taking materials away from shelves does not stop the circulation of offensive materials. It merely puts up a barrier that may mean some people cannot access the materials they need or rely on. 

In addition to the effects of censorship on individual rights, one must consider the impact that these practices have on learning and education. There is a wide range of materials at our libraries that can help us to expand our knowledge. Keeping materials off the shelves does nothing but limit our ability to grow and further our understanding of the world. 

Censorship in libraries is not only wrong,
