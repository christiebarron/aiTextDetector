The construction of the Empire State Building was a major technological feat of its time, having been completed in 1931. The skyscraper was innovative for its time, notable for its extreme height and for features such as the world-famous mooring mast for dirigibles. Unfortunately, there were considerable obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in order for this novel adaptation to become a reality.

First and foremost, there was the engineering challenge posed by devising a secure and strong mooring mast to which a dirigible could attach. The mooring mast at the Empire State Building had to be considerably taller than others of its kind due to the height of the skyscraper, and so additional engineering issues had to be addressed in order to ensure the mast was stable enough to hold the weight of a large airship.

Next, the challenge of safely guiding a dirigible to the mooring mast had to be addressed, as a complex network of air traffic control channels had to be developed in order to bring the airship to the mast without incident. Without accurate navigation systems in place, the risk of catastrophe, and the connotations that could have had for the building, was too great to ignore.

The final obstacle that the builders faced was public opinion about the use of dirigibles for transportation. Although the development of dirigibles represented a major technological advance, the dangers posed by their use were still very real and public opinion leaned towards them being unreliable. This made potential investors and government regulators wary of such a radical proposal, and so much effort had to be put into promoting the concept and
