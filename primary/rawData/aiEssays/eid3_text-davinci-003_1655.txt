The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski plays an important role in the story.  The bike ride takes place on a rugged, mountainous terrain, with steep hills and sharp curves. The winding roads and lack of trees, since it’s August, create an intimidating environment for the protagonist. This setting serves to complicate the journey and creates suspense as to what will happen. 

As the cyclist journeys, his body is simultaneously exposed to the natural elements, like wind and sun, and the physical processes associated with hardship, like exhaustion and sweat.
