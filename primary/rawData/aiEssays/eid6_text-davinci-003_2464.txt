The Empire State Building was a revolutionary architectural and economic feat when it was completed in 1931. While its main purpose was to provide office space and a tourist attraction in New York City, the builders had another unique idea in mind. They dreamed of rigging the spire at the top of the building to have airships, known as dirigibles, dock on it. However, the realization of this feat was no small undertaking and numerous obstacles had to be addressed before it could be realized.

The most obvious obstacle the builders had to overcome was the difficulty in connecting the Empire State Building to the dirigibles' mooring mast without causing any structural damage. The mooring mast was to be composed of a steel tower built higher than the Empire State Building itself so that the dirigible could safely dock. As if this feat wasn't impressive enough, the mooring mast also had to be anchored to the ground. Trying to invent a method to suspend the airship while ensuring that it did not become subjected to high winds and unstable weather conditions was an even greater challenge.

The builders of the Empire State Building found a promising solution in the form of Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's 'The Mooring Mast.' It detailed the construction process for a secure and weather-resistant mooring mast that could be used for dirigibles. This essay showed how a system of cables could be implemented to secure the mooring mast to the ground and how a navigator had to coordinate the airship's approach so that it was properly connected to the mooring mast.
