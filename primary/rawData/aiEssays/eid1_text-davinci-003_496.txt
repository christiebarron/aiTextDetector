Dear Editor,

As the world advances, so too do the range of technology tools at our fingertips. Computers in particular have infiltrated all aspects of life, and the effects they have on people are undeniable.

For many people, computers open the door to endless connections and opportunities, and can be the gateway to education and career advancements. With the right tools and resources within reach, computers allow us to better ourselves and further expand our horizons.

On the flipside, computers can also be a double edged sword. With the rise of social media, computer addiction can be fed and perpetuated easily. Compulsive technology use can strain relationships and divert focus from important tasks. If a person's life is largely oriented around computer activities, such as gaming, buying, and watching videos, their ability to manage practical day-to-day activities can suffer.

At the end of the day, computers are a tool, and it's up to the individual person to determine how to use this tool. Used effectively, computers can be an asset to people and society, whereas used in excess, computers can have harmful effects. That being said, it's important for people to take a balanced approach to computer use and find a healthy balance in their lives.

Sincerely, 
 [Your Name]
