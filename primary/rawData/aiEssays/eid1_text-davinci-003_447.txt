Dear Editor,

As technology advances and computer use becomes increasingly widespread, the effects computers are having on people are becoming more and more apparent. My opinion is that the effects of computer use on people are generally positive; they can improve our lives in many ways.

Computers provide us with the opportunity to conduct research quickly and accurately, giving us the ability to access vast amounts of information at the click of a mouse. With the advent of the Internet, we now have access to an unprecedented amount of data, enabling us to expand and enrich our knowledge base. Furthermore, computers provide a platform for new forms of communication--such as email and instant messaging--that allow us to keep in touch with friends and family who live far away.

Computers also enable us to access entertainment in ways that weren't possible before. We can watch movies, listen to music, and play games from the comfort of our own home. Games have become a powerful tool for learning, as well. From teaching children to count to helping adults learn new skills, computers provide us with an array of educational opportunities.

In addition, computers can make our lives easier by automating mundane tasks, allowing us to be more productive in our day-to-day lives. With the right software and hardware, most of us are capable of accomplishing much more in a given day simply by utilizing the power of computers.

Clearly, the effects of computer use on people are overwhelmingly positive. With
