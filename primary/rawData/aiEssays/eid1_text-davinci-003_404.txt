Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. It is my belief that computers have had a largely positive effect on our lives.

With more advanced technology, computers have enabled us to do so much more in a shorter amount of time. They have made possible a type of collaboration that was not previously feasible. Whether it's studying with homework help apps or working remotely with co-workers on shared documents, computers make it easier to stay connected with others.

In addition, computers can be extremely helpful to those who are physically or mentally challenged. People with limited mobility or impaired vision often rely on computers to do things like stay current on news and trends, or even to shop or order food. By providing users with enhanced accessibility, computers level the playing field and give everyone a chance to get ahead.

Finally, computers allow us to stay entertained. From streaming video and music to playing online games, the world of computers can provide hours of entertainment. The possibilities are truly endless.

In conclusion, computers have had a tremendous impact on our lives, and I think it is an overwhelmingly positive one. I urge your readers to embrace computers and all that they have to offer. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
