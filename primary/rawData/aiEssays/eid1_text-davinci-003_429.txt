Dear Editor,

As technology advances, more and more young people are glued to their computers. But are computers truly beneficial to our lives? In my opinion, computers are not as helpful as they are made out to be.

First and foremost, too much time and focus on computer activities can have an effect on a person's mental health. Overusing the computer could lead to physical issues, such as eye fatigue and back pain, along with long term issues like depression and anxiety. On top of this, studies have shown that too much time spent on the computer can lead to a decrease in physical activity, which in turn can cause obesity, diabetes, and other health problems.

Moreover, computers limit our physical contacts and eye contacts with other people. Instead of interacting with people face-to-face, more people are now resorting to communicating through digital means, which can be detrimental to our emotional attachments with other people. Since humans are social beings, it is essential for us to have meaningful relationships with other people. 

Overall, computers are not essential items in our lives. We need to exercise moderation and caution when it comes to using them. We must also not forget the importance of other activities that require physical and emotional connections between people.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
