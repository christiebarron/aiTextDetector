I'll never forget the moment my best friend and I shared a laugh. We had been talking on the phone for hours and somehow the conversation shifted to ridiculousness. We started making jokes we both found amusing, trying to one-up each other with our puns and silliness. 

When we reached the perfect boiling point, my best friend started cracking up, and soon after I couldn't help myself and caught onto his laughter. We were laughing so hard, each of us trying to stifle the sound of our amusement, that soon more laughter erupted. We shook with glee and enjoyed every second of it. 

We eventually calmed down and weaved our way back into the serious topics that had been the primary focus before, but the thing I remembered most was the laughter. Even if our phone call was short, if the topic was serious, the laughter left this lasting impression on me. It made me feel closer and more connected with my best friend. 

The memory and the positive energy it created still reverberates to this day. Laughter is an amazing thing!
