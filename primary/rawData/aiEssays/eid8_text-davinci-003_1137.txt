It was one of those days where I just wanted to stay at home and relax. I had had a long and tiring week, so I was looking forward to finally taking a break. But then, when I was in the middle of that relaxation, my phone rang. It was my best friend, wanting to catch up after a long time apart.

I decided to take the call, and we started to catch up on all the things we had been up to in the past few months. We were both sharing funny stories, laughing and giggling in between sentences. There was something about the way we laughed together that day that just felt so natural and special.

We talked for hours that day, and although we had plenty of serious conversations, it was our laughter that made the conversation so memorable. We laughed at our own jokes, and at both of our blunders. We made fun of our own clumsiness and even laughed at the silly mistakes we had made.

After the conversation, instead of feeling even more exhausted, I felt energized. I felt like the laughter had been the perfect way to release all of the stress and tension I had been bottling up. It had been the best mid-week pick me up I could have asked for, and I knew that our friendship was just as strong as ever.
