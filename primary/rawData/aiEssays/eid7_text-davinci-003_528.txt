I remember the time I was on a long-distance flight with a friend. We were coming back from a one week vacation, and I was really excited to be home. Unfortunately for us, the flight was delayed for several hours because of bad weather. The other passengers started to get angry and frustrated, but I reminded myself to remain calm and patient.

My friend got really antsy and impatient, so I tried hard to be understanding and encouraging. I kept reminding her that the situation was out of our control and all we could do was wait. I encouraged her to take her mind off of the delay by reading a magazine or playing on her phone. 

Eventually it reached the point where people were getting too anxious and started complaining loudly towards the airline employees. I told the other passengers that if they were patient, the problem could be solved much faster and more efficiently. I think that my efforts worked because the atmosphere shifted and people started to be more calm.

We eventually made it home, but I'm proud that I was able to remain patient even in a difficult and stressful situation. Being patient can go a long way in any circumstance, and I'm grateful that I was able to apply it in this situation.
