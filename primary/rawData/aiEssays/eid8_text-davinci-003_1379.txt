I've always been a bit of a goofball, so it didn't take much to make me laugh. One day I was out on a walk with my best friend when I reached down to pick up a random stick off the ground. When I stood back up, I jokingly pretended like I was sword fighting and I started running around making funny battle noises. My best friend was so amused that she started laughing uncontrollably.

I got so caught up in the fun that I started running around like a madman, and eventually I accidentally tripped over a root and fell right on my butt. I was laughing so hard that I almost cried, and my friend was laughing just as hard. Even though I was embarrassed, I couldn't help but be grateful for that moment because it brought us closer together.

Laughter has always been an important part of our relationship, and it was moments like these that will always stay with me.
