In the early days of the Empire State Building in New York City, the visionary architects and engineers gave a lot of thought to the novel idea of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the building. Just imagine â€“ huge airships, holding up to two hundred people or ten tons of mail, floating up to the top of one of the most iconic buildings in the world! Of course, the builders soon realized that there were numerous obstacles that would need to be overcome if they wished to make this dream a reality. 

The first obstacle was ensuring the mooring mast was strong enough to support the weight of a fully laden airship. After extensive calculations, the design team determined that a steel mast with a diameter of over five feet and height of over three-hundred feet was suitable. The engineers also had to account for wind shear in the area which could potentially cause the dirigible to shift or tilt during mooring, so they designed an array of pulley systems connected to the keel of the mast which helped to secure the dirigible in place. 

The next hurdle to overcome was developing a safe way for passengers and crew to disembark. Knowing that the mooring mast would be higher than the top of the Empire State Building, the builders designed a cage elevator which could travel the remaining distance. This elevator was not only extremely functional but was also quite stylish, featuring a glass dome that allowed the passengers to take in the stunning skyline of New York City. 

The greatest obstacle of all, however, was making sure the dirigibles could land safely atop the mooring mast
