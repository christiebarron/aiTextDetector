To the editor: 

As technology continues to rapidly advance, one of the most prominent changes over the last few decades is the emergence and popularity of computers. These devices have revolutionized the way people work, communicate, and learn, and can be incredibly beneficial to business and educational endeavors. While computers are undeniably beneficial, I believe their effects on modern society should not be understated.

There is no doubt that computers have made life easier for many people, but their negative effects should not be overlooked. In this digital world, people are spending more and more time in front of screens, often disconnected from others and reality. This can lead to a decrease in physical activity, social isolation, and other long-term health problems.

Moreover, computers can also have serious psychological effects, specifically on younger individuals whose brains are still developing. Studies have shown that too much screen time can lead to depression, anxiety, and attention problems. We must be mindful of the amount of time we and our children spend with computers, and we must not let them take precedence over physical activity, socialization, and other opportunities that allow us to unplug and interact with society.

As a society, it is our responsibility to ensure that technology serves as an enabler, rather than a detriment to progress. We must be conscious of how and how much we use computers, and encourage others to do the same.

Sincerely,
