In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist has to contend with a setting full of obstacles and challenges. The rider is on a rural road with no signs or markers, only trees lining the sides. The darkness of the night falls upon the path, creating a sense of confusion and danger. The terrain is hilly and the road is covered in loose gravel, making navigation difficult.

The darkness of night can affect the cyclistâ€™s ability to see, as the rider cannot rely on the aid of street lights to provide guidance. This can lead to the cyclist becoming disoriented and lost, possibly leading to a dangerous situation. The terrain of the road is also challenging and can make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain speed and momentum. The loose gravel can cause sudden stops and stops in forward movement, making the journey more difficult and potentially hazardous.

In addition to the environment, the rider is also facing a challenging situation as they have no one to provide guidance. The cyclist is completely alone and has to find their own way. This can be a daunting experience, as the cyclist is on their own in unknown territory.
