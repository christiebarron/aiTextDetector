I remember the first time my husband and I laughed together. We had just started dating, and he had come over to my apartment to watch a movie. We were both nervous and a bit awkward, which made the movie seem to last forever. Then, halfway through, something random happened on the screen that caught us both off guard, and we both started to laugh. Before either of us knew it, we were laughing together, uncontrollably. I instantly felt closer to him than I had in months.

Eventually, our laughter subsided, and we watched the rest of the movie in a comfortable silence. After it was done, he kissed me on the cheek and headed home. That night, all I could think about was that moment of laughter, and how it seemed to bridge the gap between us. That moment set a new tone in our relationship and from that point onwards, we always had the ability to laugh together no matter what else was going on.
