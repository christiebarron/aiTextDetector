I was waiting in line for a guest list for a concert. It was already late and I knew the line would be long, but I was undeterred. I pulled out my book and got comfortable. As I read, I noticed it gradually moved faster. It wasn't until close to midnight that I made it up to the front of the line.

The person at the desk asked me for the list I was supposed to be on and fortunately, I had it. I sighed in relief but was still frustrated that it had taken so long. Instead of getting angry or complaining, I decided to be patient. 

I knew that the person at the desk had to check every list and that it was not their fault there was a line. I had to remind myself that it took as long as it did because we were getting closer to the concert, and it was probably a bigger deal than usual.

In the end, I made it into the concert without any further trouble. I was happy that I was able to stay patient and not cause a scene. Being patient can make a situation much more positive and I'm proud I was able to not ruin the night.
