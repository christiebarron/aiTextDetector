The setting in Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ is one of despair for the cyclist. It’s a long and dangerous path that he must face, with no sure signs of success ahead. The environment is cold and unwelcoming, with a harsh white sun that casts long shadows—so long that it’s unclear if the cyclist will ever reach the end. The foggy atmosphere brings a sense of mystery and fear, and he climbs higher and higher without knowing whether he’s going in the right direction. The environment is one that he can’t escape from, but he must keep going, fighting against the pain and the cold.

The bleak landscape directly influences the cyclist’s behavior. He is tired and exhausted, yet he is determined to make it to the end of the road. He faces his fears head on, pushing himself to get a few extra meters each time. Through this determination and courage, the cyclist is able to keep going despite the harsh and daunting environment. He also draws strength from his belief in himself and his mission.

The setting in ‘Rough Road Ahead’ is not only an obstacle for the cyclist
