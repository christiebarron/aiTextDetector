I was always known to be a patient person, especially when it came to dealing with people. One time, I was in a long line at the DMV waiting to get my license renewed. The line was enormously long and I had to wait a very long time. People in the line were getting increasingly irritated and some were even starting to fight. 

I kept my cool and tried my best to maintain my patience. I didn't start an argument with the people who were rude or get irritated by the long wait. Instead, I used the time to read a book, listen to music and make small talk with the people around me. 

Thankfully, when my turn finally came, I felt relieved. In the end, my patience paid off and I left the DMV feeling satisfied that I kept my calm. My ability to remain patient in stressful situations has always been something I'm proud of.
