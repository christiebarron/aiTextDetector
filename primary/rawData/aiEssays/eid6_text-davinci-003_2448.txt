The building of the Empire State Building in New York City has been cited as one of the most iconic feats in engineering feat and design. Despite being a rousing success in every other capacity, the intended purpose for the building as a docking station for dirigibles ultimately proved to be a facade and a missed opportunity due to the many obstacles the builders of the building faced.

The initial idea for the Empire State Building included the incorporation of a docking station on the buildingâ€™s 102nd floor, with 185 foot mooring masts that were to be used for passengers to disembark from dirigibles. The main motivation for the inclusion of such a station was the belief that dirigibles would become the primary form of transportation after the highway and rail systems, and as such the Empire State Building was poised to become one of the central hubs of airship travel. Unfortunately, the obstacles encountered by the planners, builders, and operators of the station proved to be too great to overcome, and the dream of the Mooring Mast never came to fruition.

The primary obstacle was the ever-changing nature of the dirigibles themselves. During the time period, airships changed in size faster than the ability to construct the mooring station at the top of the building could keep up with. The operators would have to renegotiate their agreements with the dirigible companies and make technical alterations to the station itself on a regular basis, an effort that proved to be unsustainable. Additionally, the incline of the mooring area on top of the building made it difficult for the airships to align with the mooring Mast
