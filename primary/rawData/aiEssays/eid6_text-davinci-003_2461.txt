The challenge of constructing the iconic Empire State Building (ESB), with its mooring mast, to accommodate the docking of airships posed a unique set of obstacles to its designers. The sheer size of the building, reaching a height of 1,250 feet when completed in 1931, posed an incredible engineering challenge. Its mooring mast, an integral component of the original design, was to be the tallest ever built and would have to accommodate the large Zeppelin airships of the time. 

The size of the airships presented a unique problem, because they were much larger than traditional air crafts of the era. This posed a considerable challenge to the designers of the ESB in terms of how to take the size of the airships into account and build the appropriate landing area and mooring mast in order to safely land the massive vessels. Although the ESBâ€™s mooring mast was designed to accommodate the airships, it would also have to meet certain safety standards and be capable of withstanding the load of an airship. Therefore, the ESB designers had to calculate the amount of force that would be exerted on the mooring mast when an airship was docked.

The additional safety procedure of the mooring mast retraction system was another obstacle the designers had to account for when constructing the ESB mooring mast. This was accomplished by installing lighted signals above the mast, which, when activated, would cause the mast to begin to retract. By doing so, navigating airships would be able to identify the landing area and safely dock at the ESB.
