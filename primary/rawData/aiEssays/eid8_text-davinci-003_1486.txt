It was our fifth anniversary and my wife and I had decided to take the weekend away for a romantic getaway. We had booked a cabin in the mountains, complete with a beautiful view and a roaring fireplace. 

On the first night, we decided to head to town for a nice dinner. After dining on one of the best meals of my life, we headed back to the cabin. I could tell my wife was nervous, as if something was weighing on her mind.

For some reason, she began to tell me the longest, most ridiculous story I've ever heard. It was so bad I found myself chuckling in the middle of it and by the end of it, we were both laughing hysterically.

We continued to laugh so much that I almost forgot she had been serious at the start! In that moment, even though we had both been serious moments before, it just felt like laughter was the best way to bridge the distance between us and it felt so natural and right. 

Life had thrown us a curveball but it was laughter, in the end, that had connected us and made us stronger. Even now, years later, I can still remember that night and the feeling of pure joy that came from us both finding something to laugh about, no matter what.
