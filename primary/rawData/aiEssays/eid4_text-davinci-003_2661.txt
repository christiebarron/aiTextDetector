At the end of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus,” the speaker makes an intriguing promise: “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (21-23). This declaration speaks to a sense of struggle and resilience, further accentuated by the poem’s descriptions of the harsh winter.

The speaker’s promise is likely a metaphorical indication of the difficulty associated with overcoming adversity, shown through the sample of a hibiscus, a tropical flower known for its beauty and its ability to endure even the harshest of conditions. The speaker’s promise of taking “that test again” demonstrates their commitment to fighting for what they want, even in the face of overwhelming odds. This provides a sense of optimism and hope despite the lack of comfort or assurance the poem provides.

The idea of overcoming obstacles and persevering is further demonstrated through the imagery of the “geese return[ing]” after winter (22). The geese in the poem represent a cycle. Each year they arrive, seemingly undeterred by the changing seasons and despite knowing the cold winter will soon come. Similarly, the speaker’s commitment to taking the test again is a sign of overcoming the odds and understanding that, although the testing season may come, they are undeterred by the challenge ahead.

Ultimately, Minfong Ho’s poem serves as a reminder of resilience and determination
