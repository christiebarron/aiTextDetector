I remember the time I was very excited to start a new project at work. I was assigned to a new group and had a tight deadline to meet. Despite the fact that I had no experience working with the team, and no guidance as to what I was meant to do, I remained patient.

I worked carefully to ensure that I was understanding all the instructions correctly, and tried not to rush any of the tasks. Even when the deadlines kept getting closer and the pressure to move faster was increasing, I remained calm. I surrounded myself with positive people to help me stay optimistic, and put in extra effort to make sure I was doing a great job.

At the end of the project, I was met with great success. Even though I had to wait a while before getting the results I wanted, my patience paid off and the project was a success. No matter what the project may be, I strive to remain patient and positive.
