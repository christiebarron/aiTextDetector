I was recently attending a family gathering where tensions were running high. Everyone was arguing and getting agitated with each other and I was starting to feel overwhelmed by the negative energy. However, I knew that expressing my frustration was only going to make the situation worse. I decided that the best approach would be to stay calm and patient. 

I took a few deep breaths and tried to really listen to what each person was saying. I also reminded myself that it was important to be understanding and tolerant of everyone's feelings and viewpoints. I politely responded to each person's argument without becoming too emotionally involved. 

My efforts to stay patient soon paid off. My family members soon realized that their criticism of each other wasn't going to solve anything and decided to put an end to the disagreement. I was relieved that I had managed the situation by staying patient and not letting my emotions get the best of me.
