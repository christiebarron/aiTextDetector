I had recently flown to Europe for a business trip, and I arrived at the hotel more exhausted than usual. I was informed that the room I was assigned to had been double-booked and that I would have to wait for another room to become available. Normally, this would have frustrated me to no end, but instead I remained patient. 

I knew that it wasn't the staff's fault, so I calmly told them that I would wait for the other room. I asked them if there was any way I could pass the time while waiting, and they kindly offered me a complimentary meal at the hotel restaurant. After I had been there for a while, they informed me that another room was ready. I was so grateful for their help and friendliness along the way and I was relieved that I had remained patient and understanding throughout the situation.
