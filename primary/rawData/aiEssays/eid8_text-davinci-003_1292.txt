I remember it like it was yesterday - my youngest sister telling me and my brother a silly joke she had heard, one that neither of us had heard yet. After the punchline, we all shared an initial moment of stunned silence before erupting into fits of laughter. 

My siblings and I had a lot of differences, but at that moment, it didn't matter. We were united in laughter and we were enjoying the moment that was ours. Laughter had turned a family gathering into a playful atmosphere. 

That moment wasn't about who was the oldest or who has the better job. It was about how we could all laugh together, despite our differences. We were two sisters and a brother, but we were all connected by our laughter. It was a moment that I'll cherish forever.
