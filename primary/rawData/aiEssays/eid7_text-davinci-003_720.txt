I remember a time that I was really grateful for a situation that forced me to be patient. I had agreed to look after my neighbor's children while she was gone for the weekend. I had a feeling that it could be a little hectic having four extra kids in my house and I was right.

The kids didn't understand the rules and ganged up against me when I tried my best to provide guidance. Further still, one of the younger ones was having trouble sleeping and kept coming into my room at night, which was causing me to lose a lot of sleep. To make matters worse, it was a particularly warm weekend.

However, I somehow found the patience to remain calm and help the kids with their various requests. I realized that if I responded with harshness and impatience, it wouldn't solve anything, and could actually make things worse. So instead I tried to change my attitude and approach each situation with understanding and patience.

When the weekend was over, I was really grateful that I had had the opportunity to practice using patience. The kids had responded to my calming demeanor and I had also gotten a lot more sleep than I had anticipated. It showed me the value of being patient and understanding, even when it can be difficult.
