I recently went on a camping trip with some friends. We were all excited to explore the outdoors and adventure. Little did we know that things were about to get a lot more difficult than any of us anticipated. 

On the way, our car got a flat tire in the middle of nowhere leaving us stranded. With no cell phone reception, we had no way to call for help. All of us were understandably frustrated, but one of my friends stayed surprisingly calm. 

Rather than getting angry, my friend suggested we all work together to sort out the problem. We decided to walk the nearest town, which was nearly 10 miles away. My friend kept us all motivated throughout the hours-long walk and continuously reminded us that it was only temporary.

Eventually, it started raining and the terrain became even less pleasant with every step. We were all cold and wet, but my friend still kept a cool head and suggested we should break up into two teams - one to stay with the car and the other to seek help. 

Thanks to my friend's patience, we were able to make it back to civilization and get the car fixed. His willingness to remain calm in the face of adversity was definitely inspiring and humbling.
