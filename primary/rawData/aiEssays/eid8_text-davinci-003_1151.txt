I was walking through the park with my best friend when I suddenly heard a loud and contagious laugh. I turned to see where it was coming from and noticed two older women seated on a park bench, sharing stories and chuckling heartily. 

I was captivated by the scene, and couldn't help but stand there and watch them for a few moments. The way they were laughing with so much joy and lightheartedness was so inspiring - I just wanted to soak in the atmosphere and enjoy it with them. 

My friend noticed my admiration, and quickly suggested that we join the women on the park bench. I was hesitant at first, but with a little bit of prompting, I agreed. 

We stepped up to the bench, introduced ourselves and joined in their conversation. As we talked, I found myself laughing along with them, and I noticed that even my friend was smiling. Eventually, the two older women were laughing so hard that tears were streaming down their faces. 

It was a moment of pure joy that I won't soon forget. It felt like the barriers between us were broken down, and it made me realize the power of laughter and how it can unify people. That day I learned that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people!
