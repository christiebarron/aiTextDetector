The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski paints a vivid picture of the cyclist's plight. The cyclist is on a long, mountainous journey which is full of danger and challenge. 

The constant terrain changes affect the cyclist, who must prepare and adjust his bike for each new environment. As the journey progresses, the cyclist experiences climbs, drops, and sharp turns which all test his balance, planning, and physical and mental limits. These features of the setting make it increasingly difficult for the cyclist to complete his journey and enhance the cyclist’s sense of danger and trepidation.

The cyclist also faces the mental toll of being alone in the wilderness. This creates a feeling of vulnerability for the cyclist and the setting acts to reinforce the need for the cyclist to take great care and be always vigilant. The lack of other people on the journey accentuates the cyclists’s exhaustion and his determination to complete the journey as safely as possible. 

The setting also includes physical obstacles, such as debris and wild animals, which present a challenge to the cyclist. These objects represent further barriers to his progress and further test the cyclist's adaptability and determination.
