The engineering feat known as the Empire State Building is renowned for its introduction of dirigible docking in 1931. Constructed with the intention of creating an iconic public landmark, the architects of the Empire State Building faced considerable obstacles in their mission to make dirigibles dock. Through ingenuity and perseverance, the Empire State Building defied the odds of allowing these massive airships to moor at its top. 

The biggest obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the need for a stable, vertically-oriented mast and rigging system. Dirigibles require a type of mooring mast known as a “captive mast” in order to dock, not just any pole can do. To construct such a mast, the architects had to integrate a stationary mast with a special interface between an airship and the tower. This design involves a wide mast, secured and stabilized with a series of rigging lines. Engineers crafted the mast to measure 12 inches across the base and three inches at the top and was reinforced with steel bands to ensure its sturdiness. The mast had to be secured to the top of the building, 340 meters up in the air, and feature a conical tapered design to give airships optimum maneuverability when docking and undocking. 

In addition to the Captain Mast, other specific considerations were needed for allowing dirigibles to dock. Anchor plates at the top of the building for the mast required strong winds not to shift the mooring lines. An adjustable mechanical arm was also included to support the large weight of the dirigible, and to make room for the distribution of electricity to
