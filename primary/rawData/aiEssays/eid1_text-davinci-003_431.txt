Dear Editor,

As a long time reader of your newspaper, I have recently felt strongly regarding the advances of technology, particularly in the area of computers. I believe computers have enabled people to become more productive, both on a personal and professional level.

People have access to a vast array of information, from educational publications to cutting edge research, all at the click of a mouse. We are able to connect to and interact with people from around the world, to establish networks and share information and resources. We can access all of these tools instantly, wherever and whenever we need.

However, I worry that people are becoming too dependent on the convenience of computers. Instead of challenging our minds, we often resort to easy answers that can be located through a quick Google search. We are allowing ourselves to forget, and ultimately diminishing our innovative capabilities.

We've made a great deal of progress in the last century due to our capacity for creative thinking and risk-taking. We should be able to recreate our current successes by continuing to grow, adapt and learn in this ever-evolving technological world.

With the on-going growth of technology, it is imperative that we use caution and try to maintain balance between its use and our creativity. I am confident that with practice, discipline and forethought we can continue to be productive in an ever-changing landscape, uninterrupted by our reliance on the computer.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
