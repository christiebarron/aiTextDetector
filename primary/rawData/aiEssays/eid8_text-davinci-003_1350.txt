I had always been a bit of an introvert, so I never particularly liked going out and after someone--especially someone of the opposite sex. I was always too nervous to take the initiative and never really knew what to say.

But then one day, I went to a party with a couple of friends and there I met a girl. We talked for a bit and had a few laughs, but then someone started to tell a joke and suddenly we were both in fits of laughter. 

It felt like all the awkwardness evaporated and suddenly I was relaxed and more confident. I looked over at her and she had an infectious smile that made me just want to keep laughing. We talked and joked around for the rest of the night and before I knew it, I had asked her out.

We went on many dates thereafter and when things got tense or we ran out of conversation topics, laughter was always there to help us stay connected. What started as a brief moment of shared laughter at a party had blossomed into a beautiful relationship that still exists today. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people and I will always be grateful for it.
