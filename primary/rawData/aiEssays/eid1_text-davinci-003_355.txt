To the editor:

As the computer age progresses, I am noticing more and more people falling into a sedentary lifestyle. Computers have become commonplace in our society, making life easier and more enjoyable, but with it comes unhealthy habits that can have negative effects on people’s well-being.

Spending too much time sitting in front of a computer screen is linked with weight gain, poor posture and other physical ailments. It can also contribute to poor concentration, mental health issues and affect social relationships.

This is especially true for children, who can become addicted to computer games and social media and suffer from lack of exercise. It is important for parents to set boundaries for their kids and make sure they are getting enough exercise and enjoying other activities.

With so much information accessible online, we can fall into an echo chamber of our own opinions and become cut off from the world around us. Instead, computer users should take advantage of the range of viewpoints online and expend the effort to learn about other perspectives.

In conclusion, computers can be a great asset, but it’s important to know your limits and practice healthy habits to avoid the risks associated with too much screen time.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
