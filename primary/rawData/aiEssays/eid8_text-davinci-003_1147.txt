I remember one time when my best friend and I had been at the beach all day and we were both exhausted. We decided to watch the sunset before heading home. We sat in the sand, leaning against each other for support, and watching the sky turn from bright orange to a deep pink. 

Suddenly, I couldn't help myself from laughing. It must have been the tiredness from being in the sun all day and the beauty of the sunset that made me laugh out loud. My best friend, in turn, began to laugh too. We laughed for what felt like ages, holding our stomachs and not being able to stop. 

We laughed until our sides hurt, until there were tears streaming down our faces, and until we both had to lie down to get some air. 

It's a moment that I'll never forget. That moment of complete hilarity, without any pressures or obligations, was something so special and liberating. It was one of those minutes that you'd like to just stay in forever. 

It's moments like this where I'm thankful to have a best friend so close by and always ready to embrace the ridiculousness of life with a good laugh.
