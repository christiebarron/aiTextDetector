I was on vacation with my best friend, Amanda, and we had been visiting some of our favorite places all summer. We had already seen more than we ever expected and were feeling exhausted after a long summer of sightseeing. On the drive back home, all the joy and excitement of the summer had worn off and we were both ready just to be back. 

On the last stretch of the journey, we passed through a small town and stopped at a diner for some lunch. Neither of us had much of an appetite, so we decided to order something sweet: a piece of apple pie with ice cream on the side. As we both took our first bites, something about the combination of sweet and salty reminded us both of our favorite childhood snack: peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 

We both shared a long look across the table before starting to giggle hysterically. Of course, we couldn't explain why the pie reminded us of the classic childhood treat, and it only made us laugh harder. We laughed and cried until our stomachs hurt and the waitstaff were getting uncomfortable. 

Near the end of our meal, we finally stopped laughing but we were still smiling to ourselves as we packed up and said goodbye. As we continued our journey, the joy and excitement of the summer came back to us, and we had a memory that was full of laughter, sweetness, and childhood nostalgia.
