I remember one time when my roommmate came home late at night, and she woke me up by stumbling around in the dark. Even though I had been woken up for the second time that night and I was incredibly tired, I maintained my patience. I sat up and asked her if everything was okay and she told me that she had been out with her new friends and had lost track of time.

Rather than getting angry, I simply offered her a glass of warm milk to help her sleep. She was grateful that I had been understanding and apologized for waking me up. We both chatted for a little while before she thanked me again and went to bed.

I am glad that I was able to stay patient and understanding in that situation. It could have been a much different, and far less pleasant, conversation had I let my emotions take over. Sometimes having a little patience is all it takes to make a difficult situation much better.
