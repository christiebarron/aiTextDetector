The ending of "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho brings a powerful message of hope and resilience. The main character in the poem faces a difficult and daunting taskâ€”the much-feared college entrance exam. But rather than give up, he takes courage in the beauty of nature around him to gain perspective and inspiration. 

The winter hibiscus symbolizes the main character's journey of self-growth and understanding. During cold winter days, this flower stubbornly continues to bloom, defying the season, providing a beautiful contrast to the snow that covers the ground. It stands tall and strong in the face of cold and seemingly insurmountable conditions, just like the main character who refuses to give up in the face of difficulty and fear. Instead, he finds strength in the winter hibiscus, allowing him to gain perspective and stay focused on his dream.

The ending of the poem instills in us the idea that structure can be found in times of hardship, and that with enough perseverance, dreams can be achieved. By juxtaposing the growth of the flower to the main character's journey, the poem conveys that no matter how hard the path ahead may seem, it is possible to face adversity with a sense of determination and hope. 

The poem encourages us to take courage in the beauty of the natural world around us, and to find solace in the unchanging cycles of nature. When winter fades, and the first blooms of spring come to life, the main character is invigorated with the same strength and determination of the winter hibiscus,
