I remember the first time my husband and I laughed together like it was yesterday. It was my first summer with the family, and I was feeling a bit shy and uncomfortable in my awkwardness around him. He had finally agreed to take me camping with the rest of his family and I was so excited; I wanted to make a good impression.

We had hiked up to the tent site and set up everything just as the sun started to set. We were eating our dinner, soaking in the last bit of daylight when I accidentally spilled my lemonade on the ground.

My husband started to laugh, mostly at my expense, of course. But I couldn't help but laugh right along with him. We both ended up laughing so hard that we had tears streaming down our faces and our sides were aching.

From that moment on, I knew that our relationship would be filled with so much laughter and joy. It was the moment that we let down our guards and connected on a deeper level. It's been many years since then, but I can still recall the way that first laugh made me feel as if it was yesterday.
