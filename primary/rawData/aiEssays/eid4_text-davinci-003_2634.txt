In Minfong Ho’s story “Winter Hibiscus,” the main character, a young Chinese girl named Ah Tang, is struggling with learning English and feeling out of place in her American school. Throughout the story, Ah Tang tries to learn English words and practice American customs, like playing basketball and studying for a test, but alas she fails both. The story culminates as Ah Tang and her family travel to China for the winter, leaving the hibiscus flower in their garden to die with the coming frost. 

Ah Tang's mother's words at the story's end; "When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again," signify something much larger than a single test. This ending speaks to the idea of resilience and hope. Despite the frost that will soon come and seemingly kill the hibiscus flower, Ah Tang's mother can find optimism in the fact that when they return in the spring, things will be better. This hope rings true, as the same hibiscus flower Ah Tang thought was dead ends up in bloom in the spring and full of beautiful pink flowers. 

This ending also serves as a representation of Ah Tang's newfound hope and resilience. Just as her mother has faith the hibiscus will return in the spring, Ah Tang herself has faith that with the passing of time the difficult winter of acclimating to a new culture will pass, and she will one day be successful in taking the test.
