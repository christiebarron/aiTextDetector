It was my brother’s fifth birthday party, and I remember the room was filled with children, balloons and a very large, helium-filled balloon right in the center of the room. As I looked up at the balloon, I noticed a huge smiley face printed on it. I was thrilled to finally have a chance to give my brother the gift which I had been planning for so long.

So I guess it was only natural that the moment I called out the surprise and unveiled the gift, the entire room erupted into peals of laughter. Everyone, in their own little bubble of joviality, turned towards me with bright and cheerful grins. 

My brother was overjoyed, and he hugged me tightly. He couldn’t stop laughing, and it wasn’t long before the entire room joined in. The atmosphere was contagious and it seemed like the laughter in the room amplified all of the positive energy. 

We all celebrated and enjoyed the laughter that had become so integral to that moment. Even the large, helium-filled balloon seemed to be smiling approvingly, as though it was happy to be the source of joy and happiness for all of us that day. Everything just felt so light and wonderful, and I’ll never forget the joy and laughter that filled that room.
