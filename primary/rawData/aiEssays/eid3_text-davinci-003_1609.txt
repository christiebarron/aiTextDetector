In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist is faced with a number of challenges in their time on the road. From the beginning of their journey, the cyclist must face the rugged terrain. Sharp rises, curves and descents can tire out the cyclist quickly, leading to a grueling ride regardless of the speed they are traveling. On top of the difficult conditions of the road, the weather can also play a major factor in the difficulties the cyclist must overcome. Heat in the summer can make the cyclist’s effort feel more intense due to the additional perspiration produced, making the journey more uncomfortable and having the cyclist utilize more energy. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the cold in the winter months can add further wear and tear on the cyclist, as their body works extra hard to keep them warm on the journey.

The cyclist also must face the forces of nature during their ride. Weather can take away the cyclist’s visibility and make it more difficult to traverse the rugged terrain. Wind in particular can be a major adversary during a ride. Large gusts can cause the cyclist to slow down and even tip over their bike while smaller gusts can be tiring
