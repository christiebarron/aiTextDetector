The concluding line of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” is both a metaphor and a reminder of how life often presents us with challenges that cannot be directly overcome. The poem examines the struggles of a student and her family who are attempting to create a better future for themselves during difficult economic times. The student has decided to take a test that could qualify her for a prestigious school, but she is overwhelmed by the pressure of achieving a high score in order to gain admission. 

The final line of the poem serves to emphasize the point that even if the student fails the test, there is still hope for a successful future. Just as the hibiscus is able to wait through the harsh winter, the student himself can endure the test and prepare for a better outcome. In this way, the poem is comparing the student's courage, resilience and strength to that of the hibiscus, and the truth behind the line is that the student will never truly be defeated. 

The idea that there is always hope, no matter what the current situation may seem, is an important one. In this way, the poem is a reminder to the student that there are countless opportunities out there, and simply because one obstacle has been encountered and could potentially be impossible to overcome, they should not give up hope. Minfong Ho has created a powerful image that speaks of perseverance, strength, and hope. Whether one's current situation is as dire as that of the student in the poem, or if one is simply stuck in a rut, the poem serves to encourage the reader
