I remember the day fondly - it was a Sunday afternoon and my family had gathered together for a potluck. We were all sitting around the table, eating, sharing stories, and laughing. 

My uncle had just finished telling a funny anecdote about his time in college. We were all in stitches and unable to stop laughing. Suddenly, my brother came up with an even funnier story about a recent experience he'd had. His impressions and the way he told it had everyone laughing even harder. 

Our laughter echoed throughout the room and I couldn't help but feel so close to each and every person in the room. In that moment, it felt like no matter what was going on between us, we could always come together and laugh like this. That's when I truly realized that laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
