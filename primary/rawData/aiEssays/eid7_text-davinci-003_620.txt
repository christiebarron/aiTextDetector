I recently took a flight to a new city – my first time away from home in a while. I was excited and a little bit nervous, too.

The check-in process was long, since the airline was overbooked. I kept my cool and waited patiently in line, not wanting to make the situation any worse. After checking in my bags and getting my boarding pass, I expected to board soon.

When it was time to board, though, I noticed that the process was going very slowly. The gate attendant was taking her time with each person and being precise. My patience was being tested, and I wanted to board the plane as soon as possible.

But instead of losing my temper, as I have done in the past, I decided to just be patient. I focused on my breathing and was mindful of my surroundings. Once it was my turn, I was greeted by the attendant with a warm smile, and my patience paid off. 

You never know what is happening on the other side, so it’s always best to practice patience. That experience taught me that patience brings understanding and the rewards can be great.
