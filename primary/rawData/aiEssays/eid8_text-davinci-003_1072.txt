It was a normal day at school and my best friend Tommy and I were walking down the hall toward our next class. I was feeling particularly silly and started to laugh for no real reason at all. Suddenly, Tommy shot me a look and cracked a joke, and that only made me laugh harder! We both ended up laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces.

At first, all the other students stopped, stared and started laughing with usâ€”there must have been something truly hysterical about the whole thing! But soon after, everyone was joining in, and soon the hallway was filled with laughter.

It felt like the happiest moment of my life, realizing just how important laughter can be in connecting two people together. Of course, we ended up being late to our next class, but it was totally worth it!
