The ending of Minfong Ho's poem, “Winter Hibiscus”, speaks to resilience and optimism in the face of hardship. The speaker seems to be experiencing a difficult time upon hearing of a test they must take, and this is symbolized by the hibiscus which, although in winter, can still be found and admired. This suggests that the speaker is able to find beauty, and peace, even in times of hardship and pressure.

This makes the ending of the poem even more impactful. The speaker presents us with a hopeful visual of the future in which the hibiscus is budding again and the snows have melted and the geese have returned. This is symbolic of the return of a better, brighter time for the speaker, which gives the impression that, after the tests and difficulties of life, everything will eventually get better.

The message of “Winter Hibiscus” is one of hope and resilience, which is something we can all relate to in our own lives. Whether it is dealing with academic exams, or physical and mental struggles, knowing that one can survive and come out of such experiences stronger is something that can bring tremendous comfort. This is why “Winter Hibiscus” ends with the speaker's intention to take the test again in the spring. That, even in the face of hardship, they will be able to push through and come out the other side stronger. It is a powerful reminder that, with enough willpower, we can make it through anything.
