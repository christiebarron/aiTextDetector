I was walking through the park with my best friend when I suddenly heard a loud, unexpected laugh erupt from her. I stopped and asked her, “What’s so funny?” 

She told me that, just now, a group of teenagers had walked by and one of them had made a silly, sarcastic comment about her having an old-fashioned umbrella. It was such an unexpected comment that it had taken her by surprise and made her laugh.

We continued walking but kept looking over our shoulders, hoping to catch another glimpse of the group of teens. My friend couldn’t help but giggle every time she recounted the comment that had been made. 

Eventually the two of us were nearly doubled over with laughter, clutching at each other in helpless mirth. 

The silly comment had broken the ice between us, and our afternoon was filled with laughter. It was one of those moments that I will never forget, and I’ll always be thankful for the humor that brought us closer as friends.
