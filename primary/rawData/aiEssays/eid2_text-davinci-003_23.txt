Censorship in libraries is a subject that has drawn intense debate for years. There are those who feel that certain materials, such as books, movies, music, and magazines, should be banned if found to be offensive in any way. However, there are those who view censorship in libraries as an infringement of our First Amendment rights and it is offensive to our freedom of expression.

Those who believe in censorship of library materials most often agree that such censorship should be limited to materials depicting graphic violence, hate speech, or inappropriate sexual content. They suggest that items found to be objectionable in such areas be removed from the shelves and only made available upon request, with parental permission if necessary. In their eyes, this measure helps to protect children and other vulnerable populations from being exposed to materials potentially damaging to their mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing.

On the other side of the argument, those opposed to censorship view it as a slippery slope leading to a suppression of intellectual freedom. They see it as an unjustified invasion of our constitutional rights to access and share knowledge, especially on a subject which is so inherently subjective. To them, it represents a danger to open dialogue, art and educational expression, as well as the ability to explore controversial topics in a safe, risk-free learning environment.

In the end, it is difficult to say definitively whether censorship in libraries is the right choice. While both sides of the argument have valid points, perhaps the best approach is to take a balanced, measured approach that allows libraries to continue to be the diverse, inclusive places of learning they are meant to be while still providing safeguards against materials
