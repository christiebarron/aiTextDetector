I was walking to my car after a long day of work when I noticed a woman struggling to cross the street. She was walking with a cane and I could tell she was having difficulty. Without thinking twice, I offered her a hand, but she politely declined. She must have been embarrassed and I felt bad for her.

That's when I decided to stay and give her help. I offered to walk her across the street and hold her arm and she reluctantly accepted. We crossed the street together and walked in silence. I thought she might be angry with me, but then she smiled and thanked me for my patience.

That moment made me realize how important it is to be patient with people. Even though this woman was struggling, she could still manage it on her own. I was glad I waited for her and gave her the help she needed.
