I have a younger brother who has always been a bit of a rascal. Growing up, he was always mischievous and had difficulty following rules. 

I remember when he was about 10 years old and was really trying to get away with something major â€“ he had decided to take my bike for a ride without me knowing about it. I had gone to school that morning without realizing what he was up to. When I came home, my bike was missing, and I knew immediately that he had taken it.

I was incredibly frustrated, but I knew I had to remain patient and calm. After doing some searching around the neighborhood, I eventually found my brother riding my bike several blocks away. He was really embarrassed and apologized for taking it without asking, but I could tell he was afraid to look me in the eye.

Rather than get mad and scream at him, I explained that he was wrong for not asking before taking my bike, but that I understood why he wanted to take it. I then offered to take him to the park if he wanted to ride. 

We both rode our bikes to the park, and I made sure to keep an eye on him while he was there. He apologized several more times over the course of the afternoon and I eventually let him off the hook. Even though I was still a bit angry and frustrated about the entire situation, I knew it was important for me to stay patient and try to make the best of it.
