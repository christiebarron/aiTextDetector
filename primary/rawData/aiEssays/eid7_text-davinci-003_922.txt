I recall a situation from a few years ago when I was asked to substitute teach a junior high math class for a few days. I was nervous but determined to do a good job. On my third day, the students were especially unruly, talking out of turn and not paying attention. I realized right away that I was going to have to take a different approach if I was going to get through the class.

So, instead of getting angry, I stayed calm and patient with the students. I moved to each group of students, speaking to them one-on-one and reminding them of their responsibilities in the classroom. I also took the time to listen to their individual stories and appreciate their ideas and opinions.

My patience with the kids paid off in the end. Not only did they start to pay attention during class, but they eventually respected me as a teacher. It was a great reminder that being patient and understanding pays off in so many different ways.
