I was out with a group of friends and after a few drinks, we all started to get very silly. As we were talking and laughing, I suddenly heard something that made me burst into knowing laughter. My friend had been sharing the details of her recent date, and when she finished, she tossed off with a wry smile, "The date ended with me tripping over his welcome mat and landing flat on my face!"

None of us could help but collectively roll with laughter. It was so ridiculous, and yet so relatable. From there, the conversation shifted. As we all started talking about our dating mishaps, it eventually evolved into a full-on roast of each other's past experiences. Nothing hurtful was said; we were just sharing comical anecdotes and laughing together. 

Eventually, we all started to settle down again and go back to our original conversations. As I sat there, I was so grateful for the experience of shared laughter. It was a reminder that no matter how much life throws at us, we can still come together and find joy in one another's presence.
