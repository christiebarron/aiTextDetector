This in an interesting, and thought provoking, ending to Minfong Ho’s story ‘Winter Hibiscus’. The reader, at this point in the story, has encountered the main character and their understanding of a very specific test in their school. This test is significant to them because it is a gateway to a brighter future, and based on their score on this very test, their career prospects could very well be determined. 

However, by the story ending in this manner, it implies a hopefulness for the character. The phrase ‘When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding’ is quite allegorical. The geese returning and the snow melting after the winter is symbolic of a new beginning. The hibiscus budding shows that no matter the season of life, there is hope that things will not remain the same forever. New life will always come, as will new opportunities. 

The character, promising to take the test again in the spring, is a way of saying that they will still attempt to strive for a better future no matter the situation that they’re in. The phrase ‘take that test again’ implies that despite having taken the test in the winter, (which may have potentially been difficult for them) they are still willing to put themselves out there and try again. The story hints at a degree of determination, faith, and resilience from the main character, showing that regardless of the odds, they still believe in themselves.
