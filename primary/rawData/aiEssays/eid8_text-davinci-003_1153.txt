I remember when I first met my now best friend. We had just started our first year of college, and we were assigned to be roommates. We were both having a hard time adjusting to college life and were struggling with anxiety and fear of the unknown. 

One day we decided to get out of our dorm room for a little break and we ended up walking around campus. We stumbled into this park on campus, and there was a large group of people playing a game of tag. We just stood there, watching, and before we knew it we were both laughing hysterically at the silliness of it all. We looked at each other in surprise, and that's when we knew we would be friends. We stuck around and continued to laugh together, and since then, laughter has always been a part of our relationship. 

Whenever we face challenging times, we always look to each other to share a laugh and get us through. Laughter has a way of connecting us to each other, and to our own resilience. It reminds us of the silliness of life and helps us to move past any troubles and remember what matters. Without laughter, our friendship would certainly not be as strong or special as it is today.
