The developers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing the docking of dirigibles. In the 1920s, this was a new area of technology, and the Empire State Building was one of the first large structures built to accommodate dirigibles, also known as airships. The complexity and size of the task required the development of specific infrastructure and specialized equipment.

The first major obstacle was in adapting the building to the specific needs of dirigibles. The Empire State Building was designed with an open shaft on the top of the building that enabled a docking mast to be installed. The docking mast was designed to include a system of strong steel cables and a large winch which allowed dirigibles to securely and safely connect and dock. The setup also included a series of large and strong rings designed to handle the cables, as well as an additional mooring mast.

Another challenge was in providing a safe atmosphere for the occupants of the dirigible. Therefore, the design for the docking mast included an enclosed system of observation rooms and windows, which enabled the control room and operator to observe the dirigible during docking. 

Finally, the Empire State Building required the development of a new system in order to ensure the safe docking and mooring of the dirigible. This system included radio beacons, radio masts, and navigational aides, which were all necessary to ensure the safe and proper docking of the dirigibles.

Overall, the developers of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in allowing the docking of dirigibles. By developing new infrastructure, specialized equipment, and navigational aides
