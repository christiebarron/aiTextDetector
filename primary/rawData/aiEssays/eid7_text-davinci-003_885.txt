I was recently giving a presentation at work to a large group of people. Halfway through, the projector suddenly shut off and all the technical equipment failed. Everyone began to become frustrated and some people were even getting angry. 

I knew in that moment that if I got flustered it would only make the situation worse. Instead, I took a deep breath and calmly asked if anyone had a laptop or iPad I could borrow so that I could continue the presentation. After a few minutes, someone lent me one and I was able to continue. 

Throughout the entire fiasco, I was patient and kept my composure. The situation eventually resolved itself and the presentation went on without any further problem. I was proud of myself for maintaining my patience and not escalating the situation.
