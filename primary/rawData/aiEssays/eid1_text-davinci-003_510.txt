Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people today. I believe that computers have been both a blessing and a curse to humanity.

On the one hand, computers have revolutionized how we gather, sort and access information, thereby making life and work so much easier. It is now possible to engage in online learning, work from home and keep in touch with friends and family from the comfort of oneâ€™s own home. In addition, the prevalence of computers has decreased the amount of time people spend traveling to and from meetings and appointments.

On the other hand, computers have had a slightly more negative effect on people. There is an increase in the amount of time people spend on their devices and in front of screens, which can lead to a decrease in physical activity, sleep deprivation and eye strain. Furthermore, the use of certain devices and apps can lead to a decline in communication and interpersonal skills, as well as create a mental barrier between people.

Therefore, I strongly believe that people should use computers judiciously and balance their computer usage with regular physical activity, healthy sleep and real-face interaction with loved ones. Real meaningful interaction is still the most important factor when it comes to true human connection.

I hope that readers will take my opinion into consideration and take steps to create sustainable balance in their lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
