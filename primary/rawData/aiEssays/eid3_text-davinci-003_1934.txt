In Joe Kurmaski’s short story ‘Rough Road Ahead’, the features of the setting play an important role in affecting the cyclist. Through the landscape, the weather, and the difficulty of the terrain, the cyclist experiences moods which are significantly different from those when indoors. 

The story’s setting is among the rolling hills of Kern County, California. The hills create an atmosphere of both adventure and a constant challenge. Although the scenery might be beautiful, the cyclist must face the reality of a strenuous physical test as they battle against the ever-changing inclines and declines as well as battling against the fierce sunlight.

The weather further complicates the situation for the cyclist. The story is set in midsummer, when the sun is unrelenting in its intensity. This further compounds the difficulty of the cyclist’s already strenuous journey. Furthermore, the dry air can leave the skin taut and make breathing uncomfortable for the cyclist.

The terrain also creates additional challenge for the cyclist. The roads are narrow and winding with little room for manoeuvring. Additionally, loose rocks and gravel make the road a difficult surface to ride on. All these together create a difficult ride
