When I was in high school, I was an assistant teacher to the kindergarten class. One day a new student, Max, walked in and he was very shy. He had a hard time making friends and participating in class.

I was determined to help him out, so I made it my mission to get him to open up and enjoy school. Every morning I would make him feel special by greeting him first and asking him how he was doing, and I would even give him extra hugs and high fives.

It took a few weeks of being patient and understanding, but eventually Max began to come out of his shell. He started bonding with the other kids in the class and smiling more. Seeing him gain confidence and start to enjoy school was rewarding. 

I knew Max was still a bit shy and it would take more time for him to feel completely confident, but I was proud of the progress he had made. I kept being patient and understanding, and sure enough, by the end of the school year Max was a totally different person!

It was very rewarding to see how much he had grown and the lessons he had learned. It was a great reminder of the power of being patient and understanding.
