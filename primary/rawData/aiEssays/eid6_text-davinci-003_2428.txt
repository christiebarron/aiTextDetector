The Empire State Building was a marvelous architectural marvel when it opened in May 1931. Its greatest engineering feat was its 86th floor- mooring mast, designed to allow airships, or dirigibles, to dock at the top of the building. This feat was remarkable for its time, but it also posed a great challenge for its builders as they navigated how to make dirigibles dock safely onto the building.

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced with the mooring mast was the technical challenges of its construction. The mast had to be cantilevered out of the building in order to accommodate the mooring lines of the airship without interfering with the 86th floor observation decks. To build the mast, the builders had to create a steel box beam to endure high winds and extreme weather conditions, while still allowing the airship to dock easily with the mooring lines. This was a complex engineering feat that had to be accomplished using techniques and materials that were cutting-edge for the time.

The next obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to address was how to securely dock the dirigibles to the mooring mast. This required an intricate system of pulleys, winches, and specially designed mooring lines, developed to ensure that the airship was properly secured to the building. The engineers also had to employ a system of control cables to be used to guide the airship into position. In short, docking the dirigible to the mooring mast was no small feat and took careful planning and engineering prowess.
