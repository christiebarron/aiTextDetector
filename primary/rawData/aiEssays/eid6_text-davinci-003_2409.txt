The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a daunting one, as the architects and builders faced numerous obstacles in their endeavor. “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted outlines the complex engineering, technological, and financial hurdles associated with such an ambitious project.

The sheer size of the project was intimidating. According to Lüsted, it required “a very large opening in the roof, making a structural support of the roofing possible.” It necessitated the building's elevation to 1,250 feet and the construction of a 200-foot steel mast mounted on the roof. The massive mast was necessary in order to give the dirigible moored at ground level enough slack to maneuver properly. The architects also had to plan for the complex system of docking mechanisms, which included lockable cables and retractable walkways.

Perhaps the greatest obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building had to do with the sheer weight of the dirigibles that would attempt to dock. According to Lüsted, the combined weight of the dirigible and its 4-ton mooring mast topped out at close to 50 tons. The strain of the added weight isn't to be underestimated; the building had to be rigid enough to support such a tremendous force.

In order to remedy this issue, the architects of the Empire State Building had to design the building’s structure in such a way that it could withstand the additional load without compromising its cost or integrity. The mast and its associated hangers and support cables had to be designed to bear
