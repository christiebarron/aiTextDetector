I remember one of my first dates with my now-husband like it was yesterday. We had gone to see a comedy show and were laughing all night. We had talked and laughed for hours, our laughter echoing in the theater.

When the show was over, we decided to go for a walk. It was a beautiful night; the stars twinkling in the clear sky, the moonlight casting a warm glow over us. We walked hand in hand, letting conversation and laughter flow naturally between us. 

At one point, my husband stopped and pulled something out of his pocket. He handed it to me and said “I got you something.” It was a small, plastic pig with ears that went oink when you squeezed it. We both started laughing and couldn’t stop. We joked about how hilarious it was and about how we’d have to have a pig for a pet.

The laughter only stopped when we got to the end of the street, and my husband had to leave. The memory of that night will always stay with me, and I’ll never forget the sound of our laughter, echoing in the night.
