Censorship in libraries has become a much-debated issue recently. Many argue in favor of libraries removing books, music, movies, and magazines that are deemed offensive, while others are sternly opposed to any kind of censorship in libraries. I believe that censorship in libraries should absolutely be avoided, as it violates the right to freedom of information. 

Libraries are a place of knowledge, where all kinds of books, magazines, and other media should be made available to the public, no matter how controversial or uncomfortable the topic might be. Books that might be seen as offensive can provide an important source of information about the cultures, values, and beliefs of certain groups of people. To censor these books would be to deny people their culture and eliminate a valuable source of knowledge. Furthermore, taking action to censor any kind of knowledge would be a huge violation of our right to freedom of information and essentially mean oppressing the publicâ€™s ability to think for themselves. 

It is widely accepted that libraries should block access to vulgar and sexually explicit materials. However, libraries must still come up with ways to make sure that materials such as these still remain available, but with access limited to adults. This way, people that are interested in accessing these materials can do so while protecting children from exposure to content they should not see. 

Furthermore, taking out any types of materials from circulation could send a disconcerting message that the library is censoring information, and discourage patrons from utilizing the library. This could leave people feeling ostracized, or otherwise targeted by the library, and discourage them from being involved in
