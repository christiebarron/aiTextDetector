The process of constructing a landmark structure like the Empire State Building was no easy feat. Any builder faced numerous challenges and troubles before the crowning achievement of such a marvelous structure. In this case, the builders and engineers of the Empire State Building faced the daunting task of allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. This process was complex and involved several obstacles, which are highlighted in Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's story "The Mooring Mast."

The first and foremost obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the weight of the structure. The building was much heavier than it was necessary to support the docking of a dirigible, so significant reinforcements were needed to accommodate such an unusual task. A steel mast rising 1000 feet into the air was erected, and the structure had to be fortified with ancillary columns, cables, and rivets to ensure that it could withstand the extreme forces exerted on the occupants of the dirigible.

The outer building of the Empire State Building was another challenge that needed to be overcome. The thin layer of tiles that covered the building was not strong enough to accommodate both the docking of the dirigible and its occupants. The building had to be outfitted with a steel terrace cantilevered out from the wall, adding both enough stability and a wide berth for the dirigible's passengers to disembark.

Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building had to confront the factor of wind speed and direction. High winds could prove to be detrimental for the integrity of the structure, so an anemometer was installed to measure the speed and direction of the wind at any
