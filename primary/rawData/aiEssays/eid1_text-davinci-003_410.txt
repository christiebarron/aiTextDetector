Dear Editor, 

In this day and age, technology use is at an all-time high and computers are more important than ever. However, it can be argued that the dependence on computers and technology can have a negative effect on individuals. 

The reality is that computers have made lives easier and more convenient in many ways, from providing faster methods of learning, to providing an easier way to get information. But the ease of use can lead to a lack of physical activity, leading to decreased overall health. Too much computing also leads to a decrease in interpersonal communication, resulting in a lack of emotional intelligence. Peopleâ€™s attention spans are being stretched thin, with the influx of notifications and updated news, resulting in chaos and stress. 

It is important to use technology in moderation. We should use it to better our communities and promote healthy lifestyles, not encourage unhealthy behaviour. Technology must be used in ways that bring people together, not replace human interaction. We should strive to use technology as a tool and not allow it to become a crutch. 

To create a better and more healthy society, it is important to recognize the impact of technology use. I urge readers to think twice before indulging in an excess of technology and to consider how it may be impacting their lifestyle choices. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
