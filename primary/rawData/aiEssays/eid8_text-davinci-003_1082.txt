I've been with my best friend for years, and one of her favorite things about us is how much we laugh. Sometimes it's loud, uncontrollable guffaws that draw stares from people passing by on the street. It's like we just can't help it; funny things just come out of each of us and suddenly we are both laughing and the whole world has faded away. I remember one time, we were outside walking around, just talking and goofing off, when she stopped and pointed to my forehead. It took me a second to realize she was pointing at a giant leaf that had somehow found its way onto my face. We both burst out laughing, and soon enough everyone around was chuckling, too. 

We've been through a lot together, but it's moments like this, silliness and sharing a laugh, that make everything feel worth it. We laugh until our sides hurt, and even when the joke has been forgotten we still laugh, just because we are happy to be together. Laughter is what brought us together and laughter is what will keep us connected for years to come.
