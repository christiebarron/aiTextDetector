I recently went out to my local grocery store to buy some items and as usual the store was incredibly busy. Despite the crowds, I decided to stay and find what I needed. I patiently waited in the long line at the checkout, watching as the lines slowly moved forward.

I started to get frustrated when a customer in the line ahead of me had a problem with their card, causing the line to come to a complete halt. I could feel my temper rising, but then I thought about how I would feel in their situation. I decided to focus on my breathing and be patient.

Eventually, the customer was able to resolve the issue and the line started moving forward again. As each customer in the line arrived at the cashier, I could see that they were starting to get antsy. I kept my focus on the situation, hummed a few tunes, and reminded them to smile.

When it was my turn to check out, I thanked the cashier and gave her a friendly smile. As I left the store, I had a feeling of contentment knowing that I had kept my composure even in a difficult situation. Being patient is not always easy, but it is always worth it.
