I remember when I was a child, I was surprisingly patient during a long car journey with my family. Everyone was complaining about the lack of sleep and boredom of the seemingly endless road, but I was happy to just observe the scenery and keep silent. 

At first, my brother would poke and tease me, but I would just ignore him. I knew it was a long drive and that there was nothing that could be done about it, so I tried to remain calm. 

After a few hours, everyone gave up complaining and began to enjoy themselves. We turned up the music and actually started to sing together. We would take turns spotting various landmarks and animals, it was actually quite fun. 

We made it to our destination eventually and I was proud that I had remained patient throughout the ride. It actually taught me the power of being calm in moments of frustration, and it has been a lesson I've kept with me ever since.
