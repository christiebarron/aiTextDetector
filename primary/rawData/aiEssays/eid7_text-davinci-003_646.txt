I was in a grocery store the other day, and I noticed a family ahead of me in line with a few items. It was pretty clear that they were not familiar with the store's layout and couldn't find everything they needed. The line was getting longer and the store was getting busy, so I could tell a lot of people were getting impatient.

But I decided to take a breath and be patient. I smiled, waited in line, and offered to help them find a few of the items they were looking for. We had a nice chat, and eventually they got all of their items. Even though it took a little bit longer than normal, I was happy to help. 

Being patient in that moment was the right thing to do, and I'm glad that I put the well being of another family ahead of minor inconveniences.
