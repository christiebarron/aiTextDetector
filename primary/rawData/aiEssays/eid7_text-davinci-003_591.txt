I recently had a hard day in my office. It seemed like nothing was going right and I was getting frustrated. My coworkers were frustrated with me, too. I could feel their eyes on me as I tried to calm down.

My manager noticed that something was wrong and came over to check up on me. Instead of scolding me or getting angry, she asked me what was wrong. I explained the situation to her and I could feel my frustration come to the surface.

But instead of getting angry, she listened. She told me to take a few deep breaths and concentrate on the task at hand. She reassured me that she was there for me if I needed help and was confident that, together, we could find a solution. 

I did as she suggested and slowly started to feel calmer and more confident. With her help, I was able to tackle the problem head-on and found solutions.

I was amazed at how patient and understanding my manager was. Taking a few moments of her time to be patient and listen to me turned my day around. She showed me that, sometimes, slowing down and being patient can help you find a solution and remain calm.
