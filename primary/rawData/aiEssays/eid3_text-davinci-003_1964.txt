In Joe Kurmaski’s story “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist experiences a journey that is largely determined by the setting around him. The rough terrain of the road he traverses is the first major feature of the setting which affects the cyclist. The journey is full of obstacles; from potholes, to shifting rocks, and other debris, the cyclist must constantly be on guard as he navigates his bike upstream.

But in addition to the physical hazards of the road, the cyclist also has to contend with the elements of the environment. In some places, the road is steep, causing anxieties about accelerating downwards with little control. He is exposed to the intense midday sun, and must brave the winds, raining mud and dust, which make it difficult to focus on the journey ahead. The vast openness of the countryside gives him plenty of opportunity to view the challenges he faces but also leaves him feeling isolated and alone.
