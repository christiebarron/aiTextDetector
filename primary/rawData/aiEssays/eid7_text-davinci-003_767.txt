 

I was recently in line at the grocery store, when an elderly woman arrived at the register in front of me. I could tell that she was having difficulties counting out her change, as her fingers shook and her mind seemed to wander. The cashier looked a little impatient, but I just decided to let nature take its course. 

After a few frustrating minutes, the woman slowly managed to count out the right amount of change. Though it was taking a while, I was patient with her, and I knew that rushing her wouldnâ€™t solve anything. 

Seeing that I was being patient and not pressure her, the woman actually seemed to relax a little bit. She thanked me for understanding and then continued on her way. 

At the end of the day, a little bit of patience really did go a long way. I felt glad that I had been able to help her out and make her shopping experience much less stressful.
