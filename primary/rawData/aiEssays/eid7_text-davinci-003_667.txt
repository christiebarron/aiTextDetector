I was out shopping recently at a rather overly crowded mall. I waited and waited in line at the check out stand, growing increasingly impatient. But when it was finally my turn and I realized I didn't have enough money, I was embarrassed. I had assumed the store took credit cards, but I was wrong.

The cashier was understanding and kind. He didn't rush me, instead he asked if I wanted to run to the ATM and come back. I quickly agreed, thanking him for being so patient in the process.

He smiled and nodded and I rushed off to retrieve cash. When I returned, the line had gotten bigger, but he remembered me and I was able to complete my purchase. I thanked him again and was on my way. He was so patient and kind with me even though I was inconveniencing him; I will remember his kindness for a long time.
