I remember when laughter brought my best friend and me closer together. We had been going to the same school since second grade and we were almost always together, but something changed when we were in the seventh grade. We had a disagreement about a friendship and it caused a rift between us. 

Things were tense for weeks, but we were still in the same classes and had to share a couple of lunch period together. Neither of us was willing to make the first move towards reconciliation. 

That all changed one day when we had a substitute teacher for math. The energy in the room shifted as soon as he introduced himself, and all of us kids started laughing and joking, including my friend and me. We conspired with each other and found ourselves in multiple fits of giggles. 

At the end of the day, it seemed like the disagreement had disappeared and we hugged on our way out. We continued to laugh and joke with each other like nothing had changed, and the friendship was quickly restored.  

It's amazing what a little laughter can do. I'm thankful that my friend and I could overcome our differences with a bit of humor and still remain good friends to this day.
