Dear Editor, 

In today's world, computers have become an essential part of our lives. They have radically changed the way people communicate, work, shop, and even think. But what are the effects that computers have had on people?

One significant effect that computers have had on people is increased productivity. By allowing us to easily access a vast amount of information and connect with people from all over the world, computers have sped up the process of getting things done. Furthermore, the use of computers has opened up new opportunities for workers to collaborate and manage projects more efficiently. 

Moreover, computers have improved the quality of our decision making. Advanced algorithms enable us to analyze data quickly and accurately and make decisions based on the latest research. This has improved decision making in business, finance, marketing, and other fields of study. 

Finally, computers have encouraged creativity. We now have access to a wealth of multimedia tools that allow us to create visually stunning content. Moreover, computers have enabled us to simulate environments that would otherwise be impossible or require expensive resources to replicate in the real world. 

In short, computers have had a positive influence on the way people think, work, and interact. They have enabled us to be more productive, make better decisions, and be more creative. 

I hope readers of this newspaper will agree with my opinion on the effects of computers on people. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name
