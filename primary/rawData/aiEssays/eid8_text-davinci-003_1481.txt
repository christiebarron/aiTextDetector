 

I was grabbing coffee with my friend when we started discussing our plans for the weekend. We were trying to pick the perfect activity when all of a sudden, I started talking in a robotic voice. I was making fun of one of our mutual friends who always talks like a robot, and it made my friend burst out laughing. We couldn't stop laughing and before we knew it, there were tears streaming down both of our faces. 

At that moment, nothing mattered more than laughing, and nothing felt more natural. We started making up all sorts of funny stories about our friend and everyone we knew, laughing until our stomachs hurt. 

It was like I was on the same wavelength of humor as my friend, connected in a truly unique way. I realized that laughter is one of the simplest and most beautiful ways to make a connection with someone, even if you don't know them that well. It was like something clicked, and since then I've been able to able to really appreciate laughter in all its forms.
