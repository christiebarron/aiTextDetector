I was in the checkout line at the grocery store, and there was an older woman in front of me with a large order and a few coupons. She had carefully laid out her items to organize and separate her purchases, but there were a few items she needed to go back and find. I could tell the cashier was feeling frustrated, having to go back and search through the shelves every time the woman changed her mind. 

Instead of getting impatient, I decided to be as helpful as I could. I offered to go and look for items that needed to be restocked and I helped bag what she had already purchased. 

I knew we could be done quicker this way, but the woman insisted on finding the items on her own. She said she wanted to make sure she hadn't missed anything. Despite our best efforts, it still took some time, but I didn't mind. I remained patient, understanding, and helped out where I could while she slowly completed the check out process. 

In the end, I was glad I stayed patient. With her thank you and a wave goodbye, the woman seemed to forget all of the time that had been spent looking for items and reconciling coupons. She moved to a place of comfort, feeling appreciated and not rushed.
