Many people believe that libraries should remove certain materials from their shelves if those materials are considered offensive. But limiting the materials available in libraries has far-reaching implications for the public, and for this reason, I am firmly in opposition to censorship in libraries.

Furthermore, removing certain books—for whatever reason—will prevent readers from gaining access to valuable information and knowledge that would otherwise be available for them to learn from. 

Another important point to consider is that censorship in libraries can lead to a slippery slope when it comes to deciding what materials should and should not be censored. It can be extremely difficult to determine what materials are considered offensive in the first place, and this is especially true when it comes to literature and art. Even if a book is considered “offensive” by some, does that mean it should be banned from libraries entirely?
