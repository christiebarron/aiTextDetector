Winter Hibiscus, by Minfong Ho, uses symbolism to explore the fear, confusion and stress of taking tests, as well as the hope of learning and progress. The protagonist is a young girl struggling to study for a test, stuck in a cycle of worry and frustration that, in the end, leads her to a moment of clarity and acceptance.

The story ends with her looking forward to the coming of spring, a time of renewal and rebirth. This, in turn, gives her hope that she can take the test again and, this time, be better prepared. Her acceptance of the fact that learning and growth take time, and that failing a test is not the end of the world, reflects the story’s message that it is possible to come out of a period of stress, confusion or fear and still be in a place of growth and learning.

The imagery of the winter hibiscus, which is often dormant and barely visible in the frosty winter, is a powerful symbol of the consequences of struggling to learn and pass exams. The flower, like the protagonist, appears “small, struggling, and confused” but when the freezing temperatures finally pass, and the spring sun brings a sense of renewal, it slowly buds and blooms, reminding us that no matter how bleak the present may appear, there is always still a chance of a brighter tomorrow.

The protagonist’s decision to take the test again serves as an example to readers that, despite the obstacles we may face and the confusion and fears that come with growth, it is possible to move past them and
