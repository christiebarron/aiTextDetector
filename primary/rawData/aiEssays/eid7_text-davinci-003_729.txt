I was in line at the grocery store and the woman at the register was having a hard time getting all of her coupons to work. She was becoming increasingly frustrated and I could tell the cashier was starting to feel overwhelmed. I could feel the tension in the air and I knew that if the woman didn't get her coupons to work, the line behind me was going to get very angry. 

Instead of adding to the frustration, I decided to remain patient and understanding. I spoke kindly to the woman and tried my best to help her get her coupons to work. After about 10 minutes, we managed to sort out all the issues and the woman got her items for a much lower price than she originally expected - and I don't think she could have done it without my help. 

The cashier was surprised by my patience and thanked me. I explained to her that the woman was just trying to get a good deal and I wasn't going to let the situation get out of hand. In the end, my patience paid off, and a potentially stressful situation was turned into something positive.
