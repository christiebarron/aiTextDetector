The Empire State Building was an ambitious project when it was constructed in the early 1930s in Manhattan, New York City. One of the most exciting aspects of the building, which was intended to be the tallest in the city, was the prospect of allowing dirigibles, otherwise known as airships, to dock at its mooring mast. Although ambitious and exciting, allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not as straightforward as it seemed. This essay will discuss the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced when allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first major obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the height of the mooring mast. This was because airships were typically of much greater length than the height of the mast. Specifically, the aircraft that were used during the era had an average length of 450 feet, while the Empire State Building mast was a comparatively small 700 feet above the ground. This led to the builders of the Empire State Building either using custom-made dirigibles that were shorter than the mast, or having to find a way for airships to dock to the mast without being able to use their full length.

The second obstacle that builders of the Empire State Building faced when the airships were docked was the risk of strong winds preventing them from safely taking off again. Wind speeds at the higher altitudes of the mooring mast were much stronger than on the ground, meaning the dirigibles were more exposed to stronger and more unpredictable gusts when attempting to take off. These unpredictable gusts meant
