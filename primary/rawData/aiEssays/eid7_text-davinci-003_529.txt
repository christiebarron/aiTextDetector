I remember a time when I was really struggling with a particularly difficult task. I had worked hard trying to complete it but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't get it done. I felt frustrated and overwhelmed, and after several hours of trying, I was ready to give up. 

But then, my manager strode up to my desk and without saying a single word, started to show me how to do the task. Even though I had spent hours trying, she sat with me patiently, guiding me through each step until I had it down. 

The patience she showed me was so uplifting and I felt that she genuinely wanted to help me out. Her kindness and patience will always stand out to me and it taught me a valuable lesson in staying calm even when tasks become hard.
