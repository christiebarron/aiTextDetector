In today’s world, the issue of censorship in libraries is one that has come to the forefront of public debate. With more and more diverse materials being made available to the public, the question of whether certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive has been widely discussed. As a librarian, I strongly believe that censorship in libraries is wrong and should not be practiced. 

First and foremost, libraries are a place for education and growth, and it’s essential that readers have access to a variety of materials. Removing certain materials for being found offensive is tantamount to being a censor and having the power to dictate what people should or should not read. It is up to the individual to make the decision of what materials they want to consume; this should not be limited by any institutional censorship.

Furthermore, censoring materials in libraries creates an environment of fear and limits important dialogue between different ideas. Removing books due to being found offensive is an attack on freedom of speech, and hinders the liberty of those whose names or works are censored. This stifles critical conversation, keeping the public from being fully informed about a variety of topics and issues. 

The American Library Association Code of Ethics clearly states that a library should provide an environment “in which all can freely inquire, deliberate, and formulate ideas,” and this cannot be achieved if there is censorship of materials due to their being found offensive. Even materials that contain controversial ideas can be a benefit to readers, as harsh criticisms can often spur meaningful debate and critical thinking.
