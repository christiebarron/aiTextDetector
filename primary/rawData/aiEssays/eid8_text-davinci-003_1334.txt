I had an incredible day out with my closest friend. We went shopping together and had lunch at a cafe. Then, out of nowhere, she started to laugh hysterically while I was in the middle of telling her something serious. I was confused, and asked her what was so funny. She told me she had just realised something hilarious about our situation, and burst out laughing again.

At first, I was a bit annoyed that her laughing was seeming to undermine what I was saying, but then she started to explain: She was laughing about how much had changed over the years, and how we had grown closer since we began our friendship. We had completely different, yet completely complimentary personalities, and all the ups and downs we had gone through together were too funny now to believe.

As I saw the hilarity in our situation too, I couldn't help but start to laugh as well. Suddenly, the gravity of the moment felt lighter, and we couldn't stop laughing as we recounted all of our memories.

As the laughter died down and our conversation resumed, I was filled with a warmth and appreciation for the friendship we shared. Sharing laughter can really be the best and most intimate form of communication between two people, and I was so lucky to experience it with someone I care about so deeply.
