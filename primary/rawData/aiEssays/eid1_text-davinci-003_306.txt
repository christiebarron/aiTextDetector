Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects of computers on people. As I'm sure you are aware, computers play an ever-growing role in our lives.

On the one hand, computers provide us with more convenience, allowing us to do many of the everyday tasks more quickly and efficiently. Computers have enabled us to access information more quickly than ever before, and this has been especially useful for students and researchers. Additionally, computers have allowed us to stay connected to our friends and family, both in our local community and across the globe.

However, I believe that there are some negative aspects to the increasing reliance on computers. There is an increasing amount of computer-mediated communication, which can lead to isolation and reduced social skills. People are becoming so comfortable and reliant on computers that they are not developing essential interpersonal skills that are crucial for successful communication in the real world. Furthermore, computers can sometimes be a distraction from more important tasks, leading to reduced productivity.

For these reasons, it is important to be aware of the potential positive and negative effects of computers on people. While computers are often invaluable tools for communication and access to information, I believe that it is important to draw boundaries between the virtual and physical realms. We should encourage the use of computers and the digital world while ensuring that it does not become our primary means of communication.

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
