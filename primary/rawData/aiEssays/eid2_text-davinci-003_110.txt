In an age of widespread access to all types of materials, censorship in libraries can serve powerful roles in protecting vulnerable minds and preventing harm to the community. Yet, when it comes to library censorship, striking a balance between citizen rights and community welfare can be a difficult process. 

At one end of the spectrum, people support a library’s obligation to uphold the freedom of expression, citing the First Amendment and the right to access information. At the same time, some materials may contain harmful elements and can incite violence, racism or any number of other atrocious acts. In light of these issues, it is important to evaluate the underlying principles of censorship and determine whether or not certain materials should be removed from library shelves. 

Though, in many cases, the presence of controversial materials can serve as a positive, educational experience; if left unchecked, these materials can also lead to potential harm. In such instances, censoring and removing materials from a library’s shelves would prove to be the most prudent decision. For example, books containing graphic violence, graphic images, or explicit themes should be removed if they are found to be offensive. Similarly, pornographic materials, music and movies containing racist or sexist themes should also be removed. 

Therefore, though libraries should strive to uphold citizen rights and the freedom of expression, it is important to acknowledge potential risks--and intervene when necessary to protect innocent minds. Censoring certain materials found to be offensive is often the best decision in ensuring a safe and healthy environment. Doing so allows libraries to provide an educational, responsible experience while keeping the community safe and secure.
