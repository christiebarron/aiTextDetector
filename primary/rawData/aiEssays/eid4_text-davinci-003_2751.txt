The ending of "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho speaks to the power of resilience. A young girl named Xiang, who fled Thailand for a refugee camp in Indonesia, faces many challenges including a lack of educational resources, language barriers, and a dismal living environment. Yet despite setbacks, Xiang remains determined to continue her studies. Her resolve to retake an exam at the end of winter, when her beloved hibiscus is beginning to bud again, serves as a metaphor to her courage and optimism. 

Xiang’s dedication to her education despite the obstacles she faces is representative of many refugee stories throughout history. People uprooted from their homelands often face literal and metaphorical winter periods where survival, rather than progress, becomes the only goal. This is complicated further by others’ attempts to limit their access to knowledge and opportunities. Yet, despite the odds, these refugees are often able to resiliently find hope in the darkest of times.

The last line of the story provides a powerful sense of hope that resonates deeply in these challenging times. It is a reminder that despite the obstacles and struggles we all face, the journey is never over. We can look to Xiang’s story to remember the strength of hope and the power of resilience for growth and transformation. Just as the hibiscus in winter must endure the cold, Xiang will continue her educational journey whenspring ends, the snows melt, and the geese return home. In the same way, we must have faith that despite our winter periods, we will continue to grow, learn, and thrive.
