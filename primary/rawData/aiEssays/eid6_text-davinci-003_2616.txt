The Empire State Building is an iconic structure, remembered for its sheer size and the ambition it took to construct it so quickly. One of the more unique features of the building, however, is the mooring mast on the roof, which allowed dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure. Building this mooring mast, however, posed a number of unique challenges to the engineers. 

The primary challenge was the extreme height of the building, its distance from the ground, and the need for some sort of structure that could support the weight of any airships wishing to dock. The Empire State Building was the tallest building the world had ever seen at the time of its construction; the mooring mast had to be built at the extreme height of the building to allow the airships to dock. This created a number of engineering challenges, such as finding materials and techniques that could support the mast against the buffeting winds at that great height.

The mast also needed to be incredibly maneuverable to accommodate airships of various sizes, shapes, and weight distributions. Additionally, it had to be able to move freely and not be dangerous to occupants of the structureâ€™s observation decks and other areas. Since the mooring mast had to operate at a much higher altitude than any of the current building designs, engineers had to create an all-new mast construction that both allowed airships to dock safely, and also made sure that regular building operations would not be interfered with.

Finally, there were the ongoing concerns of a practical nature. The mast had to be able to power the lighted beacon
