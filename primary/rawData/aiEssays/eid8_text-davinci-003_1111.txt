I had just met the woman of my dreams. She was charming, attractive and smart. We had talked for hours and I was sure I was in love. 

But I was still a little hesitant. I knew that if I was going to take this relationship to the next level, then we needed to be able to laugh together.

So I came up with a plan. During our next date, I took her to the local comedy club. I figured at least we would have a good time and maybe get to know each other a little better. 

When the comedians took the stage, I felt a slight pang of anxiety. What if she didn't like the same jokes as me? What if she wasn't amused by my sense of humor?

But almost immediately, the room was filled with an infectious laughter. We were laughing at all the same jokes, finishing each other's sentences and just having a great time. It was at that point that I realized I had met the one. 

We have been together ever since, and laughter is still one of our most treasured activities. We both know that it's one of the most important connections we can have and it reminds us every day why we chose each other in the first place.
