I was out to dinner with my best friend, who was visiting from out of town. It was the first time we'd seen each other in months, and we were both so excited to catch up. We were just about to order when my friend started to tell me a funny story about her cat. I couldn't help but laugh, but then she said something that had me in stitches. We were both laughing so hard that tears starting streaming down our faces and the other diners at the restaurant were staring. We couldn't get ourselves together, so we just finished our meal doubled over with laughter. That night was a great reminder of why our friendship is so special - our shared laughter is the glue that holds us together. We'll both remember that night as one of the funniest yet.
