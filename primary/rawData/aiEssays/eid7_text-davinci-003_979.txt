I remember a time I had to be extra patient. I was trying to volunteer at a local charity and it took far longer than I expected to go through the application process. From paperwork, to background checks, and finally the interviews, it felt like it was taking forever. I had to be patient and not jump to any conclusions or react negatively. 

Throughout this process, I kept a positive attitude and kept my focus on doing the right thing. I was able to take the long view and not let my frustration get the best of me. Even when I was asked the same questions multiple times, or when I had to wait weeks between steps, I was still committed. 

In the end, I was accepted by the charity and I was able to do the important work that I wanted to do. It all worked out because I stayed patient and stayed focused on the outcome I wanted.
