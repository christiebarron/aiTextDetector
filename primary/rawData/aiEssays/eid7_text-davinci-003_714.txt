I had been working at my family's restaurant for about three years when the pandemic hit. We had to shut down for a time and for a while, I had no idea what my next steps were going to be. I was scared and frankly, a little impatient - I just wanted to solve all of our problems immediately. 

My father, however, was different. He was calm, patient and collected. He would spend time each morning looking for ways to make up for lost revenue, and he would take long walks in the afternoon to clear his head and come up with creative ideas. He reminded us that things took time and that if we stayed patient, we could get back on our feet sooner.

And, sure enough, he was right. Eventually, we were able to start up take out and delivery services. Slowly, our regular customers started coming back, and more even joined in. Thanks to my dad's patience, I learned to tackle problems with a clear head and think of solutions more strategically.
