Many people have different perspectives on the issue of censorship in libraries. Some believe that libraries should offer only educational material and nothing can be considered offensive. Other argue that libraries should be the domains of freedom of information and allow access to all materials without censorship. I personally believe that libraries should provide a balance between accessibility to a variety of material and removal of material that could be considered offensive. 

Though libraries should continuously monitor their shelves to ensure they follow the changing standards of society, censorship has limitations. Libraries should only remove material that contains certain elements that are more prone to being offensive. Such elements are threats of violence, explicit sexual content, and strong profanity. Books, music, movies, and magazines with these elements can be dangerous for children and teens who can get access to them. They can also be disrespectful to social or political norms of a community. For these reasons,

libraries should take active measures to remove material of this kind from library shelves and replace them with books or material that is educational and accurate and respects the opinions of readers. 

Apart from this, libraries should also offer resources to allow readers to draw their own conclusions about controversial topics, instead of forcing censorship. Thus, readers can compare and contrast different perspectives, allowing them to form unbiased opinions. This ensures that everyone has the right to access information and consider the issues without being intimidated. 

Though censorship could be beneficial in some situations, it should always be done responsibly and in a manner that still allows readers access to a wide array of information. This can ensure that all citizens have the opportunity to access materials that show respect for their culture
