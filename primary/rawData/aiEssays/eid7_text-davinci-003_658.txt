I remember a time when I was patient that was very difficult. I was helping my grandparents move into a new home. My grandparents were really struggling with the move and needed extra help. Unfortunately, I had a really busy schedule and was unable to help during the day. So, I stayed up late into the night helping them unpack and organize the new home.

It was exhausting, but I kept a positive attitude. I stayed patient and encouraging even when things were not going according to plan. After several late nights, we finally got the new home organized and my grandparents were able to better adjust to their new life. I am proud that I maintained a patient attitude, which allowed them to feel more at ease during the transition.
