 

I remember one night in particular when I was staying with my best friend before the pandemic started. We were up way too late, telling stories and having a blast. After several hours of discussing every topic imaginable, we started to get a bit worn out and exhausted. 

I decided it was time for us to go to sleep, but before I could even finish the sentence, we both started looking at each other and burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. We laughed until the tears started streaming down our faces, and I couldn't help but gasp for air between the fits of laughter that shook our bodies. 

We laid there on the bed and laughed until we could hardly move. It was in that moment that I realized how special it was to have someone in my life that I could laugh with and be so silly with â€” and most importantly, that I could be so honest and vulnerable with. 

We have shared countless laughs in the years since, and I will be forever thankful that laughter can bring us so close together.
