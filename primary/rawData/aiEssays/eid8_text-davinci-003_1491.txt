I remember it clearly; it was the first time I had seen my boyfriend laugh. We had been dating for a few weeks and had experienced some of the typical first date type of awkwardness, but that night we had decided to go out for drinks. 

We were both a bit nervous and kept fidgeting with our drinks, when suddenly my boyfriend started to laugh. His laugh was contagious, and I couldn’t help but start laughing too. Soon enough, we were both laughing uncontrollably without knowing why. We had managed to break the ice and it felt amazing. 

As the night went by, we started to learn more about each other, and the laughs kept coming. Even though we didn’t know each other that well at the time, we found joy in the small jokes and anecdotes we shared. 

Now, after a few years, laughter is still an important and meaningful part of our relationship. We always take turns to make each other laugh, and it keeps us bonded and grounded. It’s still reminds us how lucky we are to have each other and share these silly moments together.
