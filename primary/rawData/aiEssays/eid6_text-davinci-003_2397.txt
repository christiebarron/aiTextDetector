The building of the Empire State Building in 1931 was a great feat. Not only would it be one of the tallest structures ever, but it also was designed with the specific purpose of allowing dirigibles to dock. This ambitious plan was met with several obstacles that the builders would have to overcome in order for these gigantic airships to have the ability to tie up at the mast.

One of the biggest challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the structural design. The plan was for a mooring mast to be constructed that would stand 200 feet above the roofs of the building, allowing the dirigibles to securely land. This required a much more substantial design than the usual steel mesh wire mast used with zeppelins in the past. To ensure the safety of the airship and its passengers, the mast had to be strong and secure against gusts of wind, while still remaining lightweight. This was achieved with a shear truss structure with two girders running in opposite directions, creating a stable and secure platform.

The second essential obstacle involves the installation of a tramway system at the base of the mast. This would be required to allow for the delivery of supplies and equipment to the observation rooms located inside the Empire State Building. To execute this, a space needed to be created for personnel to easily access the observation area at the top of the mast. This was done by installing a ramp system from the roof of the building to the observation space, with a narrow passageway connecting them. On the roof of the building, a small platform was created with enough space to accommodate a win
