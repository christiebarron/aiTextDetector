I remember the day my wife and I found out we were pregnant. She was the happiest I had ever seen her. We both just stood in awed silence, letting the enormity of the news sink in. At last, we both started to laugh—it was an uncontrollable and contagious laughter, seemingly born out of pure joy.

Those moments are some of my fondest memories. We knew that we had so much ahead of us, but we allowed ourselves to just revel in the beauty of the moment. I felt a connection and a bond between us that I had never felt before.

Years later, and our house is full of children. Life is busy and hectic, and it's easy to forget the simple moments like that one. But every once in a while, I'm reminded of the amazing power of laughter—in how it connects us, unites us, and creates lasting memories.
