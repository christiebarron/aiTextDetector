I remember the time I was at the DMV to renew my driver’s license. I got there early so I was first in line, but the DMV had technical difficulties and was having trouble getting the computers to work. I expected to be there for a while, but I didn’t realize how long it would actually take.

After waiting for almost two hours, my patience was slowly fading. There were several people around me in line who were getting increasingly frustrated and making snarky comments while they waited. I was tempted to lose my temper like they were or lash out in frustration, but instead I took a deep breath and remembered why I was waiting: to renew my driver’s license.

I chose to remain patient and instead of giving into my impatience, I silently passed the time by reading a book. After three hours, the computers were finally working properly and I was able to renew my driver’s license.

By keeping my calm and remembering why I was there in the first place, I managed to remain patient despite the long wait and stay in control the entire time.
