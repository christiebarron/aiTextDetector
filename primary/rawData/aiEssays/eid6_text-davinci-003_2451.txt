The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the main issues was convincing the public that it was safe. Despite the existing technology and regulations, many people expressed doubts about the safety of the plan. There were also technical challenges to overcome, the most challenging of which was developing a spacious yet secure mooring mast that could meet the stringent standards of the Department of Commerce and simultaneously withstand the pressure of a large dirigible.

The first obstacle for the Empire State Building was to win over the public's trust. Despite the spectacular success of the Goodyear blimp and the predictions of a new era of air travel, people were still concerned about the safety of large dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. To help alleviate these fears, the Empire State Building placed an advertisement in the New York Times reading “Safety First—Anchor at the Empire State Building” in an effort to convince potential customers that their plan was trustworthy. 

The negative perception of air travel was further compounded by technical challenges faced in creating a secure mooring mast that could withstand the pressure of a dirigible and meet the Department of Commerce’s stringent standards. Unlike a blimp, which could ascend and descend with the use of a cable, a dirigible required a more sophisticated system for mooring and anchoring. To accommodate these demands, the Empire State Building hired John Prutsman, one of the country’s most innovative structural engineers, to create a secure mast that could anchor several hundred tons of airship. 

The mast had to
