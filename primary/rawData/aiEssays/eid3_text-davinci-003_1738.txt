In Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead', the features of the setting can be seen to have a significant effect on the cyclist, and the overall tone of the poem. The poem takes place in a city, perhaps the cyclist's hometown, or a place familiar to them, which adds to the feeling of the poem. The setting is described as a 'rugged landscape' with 'cracked pavement', suggesting that the cyclist is riding through a difficult and challenging terrain. The cyclist is also surrounded by 'dim smoke and vandalized walls', which suggests a hostile and danger-filled environment.

The features of the setting are essential in emphasizing the theme of the poem, which is centered around the idea of challenging oneself and pushing through difficult situations. The presence of the rugged terrain and the graffiti-covered walls convey a sense of difficulty and struggle that the cyclist must face, demonstrating the hard physical and emotional labors that one must overcome to reach their destination. As the poem progresses, the cyclist seems to become determined to navigate the 'rough road ahead' and continue their journey, which conveys a message of resilience and perseverance that can be seen as inspiring and uplifting.
