The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic skyscrapers in the world, and at its opening in 1931, was home to the first state licensed commercial mooring mast, allowing dirigibles to dock. Despite the considerable engineering feat, the creators of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles and difficulties in allowing dirigibles to dock there.

The first obstacle was the immense weight of the mooring mast, which was a crucial element in the docking of the dirigibles. The engineers had to figure out how to find the right material, build a structure that could hold the weight and provide enough security, while also allowing the mooring mast to spin as the dirigible turns. This challenge was eventually solved by building a mast made from steel, with four arms coming out of the center and a spinning top.

The second obstacle was the amount of heat generated by the airships as they rotated above the Empire State Building. The airships had to be around 30 feet away from the tip of the mast, to ensure it didn’t get damaged, and consequently, the airship’s weight was putting a lot of strain on the building itself. To combat this, the engineers reinforced the Empire State Building’s steel frames with extra steel beams and dovetail steel framing joints. 

The third obstacle was obtaining the permits required to operate the mooring mast. Dirigible pilots were not used to navigating a skyscraper, so special permission had to be granted to the engineers to use the mast. This process was a long one and involved obtaining approval from the
