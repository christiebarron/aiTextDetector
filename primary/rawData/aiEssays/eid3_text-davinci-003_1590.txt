In Joe Kurmaski's short story, “Rough Road Ahead”, the setting is an important part of the story. It is a hot summer day in rural Pennsylvania and the cyclist is travelling down an old dirt road. The road itself is bumpy and full of rocks, making the cyclist’s ride more difficult than it should be. It is also narrow, so there is very little room for error. All these features of the setting make for a difficult and dangerous ride for the cyclist. 

The heat of the day is another factor that contributes to the cyclist’s challenge. Even though the cyclist is dressed in light clothing and wearing a cooling vest, the temperature of the day still has an impact. Not only does it make it harder to keep cool, but it can also weaken the cyclist’s muscles and make them more prone to fatigue. 

The rural setting also adds to the difficulty for the cyclist. Not only is the road long and filled with difficult terrain, but there are no facilities or serviceson the way. This means that the cyclist has to carry more water and supplies with them, and any delays or unexpected events may leave them in a precarious position.
