I was shopping at the grocery store when I noticed a woman in line with me who was obviously having some sort of issue. She was trying to pay for her items, but her card kept getting declined for some reason. She became visibly frustrated and I could tell she was about to reach her breaking point. I decided to step in and offer to pay for her groceries.

She was surprised and so thankful, but when I tried to pay with my card, it was declined as well. I was starting to feel embarrassed, but the woman smiled and said "It's alright. We can figure this out." After a few more attempts, my card finally worked, and she was able to pay for her groceries. 

As we were leaving, she thanked me again for being so patient and understanding. It really made me realize that a little bit of kindness and patience can go a long way.
