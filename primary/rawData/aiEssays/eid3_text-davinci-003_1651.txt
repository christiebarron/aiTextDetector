In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist pedals their way through their own hardships, determining their own future path. The features of the setting, from the city streets of Seattle to the darkening sky of the night, add additional layers of difficulty for the cyclist to work through.

The hustle of the city streets offers both a challenge and a promise to the cyclist. The fast-paced environment makes it difficult to navigate the roads, requiring greater focus and attention than if they were on a quiet back road with few obstacles to face. Additionally, the buildings and streetscapes provide a feeling of anonymity and make it easier to ignore the world. This can help the rider to focus inward, but it can also make it harder to realize when something is wrong.

The darkening sky of the night adds to the challenges faced by the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.” The waning light makes it harder to see the road ahead, adding an extra difficulty to the cyclist’s journey. It also adds an additional layer of difficulty when it comes to staying motivated: the night begins to feel like an endless cycle with no promise of an end in sight.
