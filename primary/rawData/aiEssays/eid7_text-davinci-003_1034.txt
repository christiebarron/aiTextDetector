I was in line at the grocery store the other day, when I noticed that the cashier was having some technical issues with her register. The line was getting longer by the second and people were getting impatient. I decided to stay calm and silently be patient while others were grumbling and rolling their eyes. 

After a few minutes of troubleshooting, the cashier was finally able to restart her register. I allowed the people behind me to go ahead of me and apologized for the wait. With a smile, the cashier told me thank you for my patience and thanked me for being understanding. It made me feel good to be able to help out in my own small way â€“ and to make the cashier's day a bit brighter!
