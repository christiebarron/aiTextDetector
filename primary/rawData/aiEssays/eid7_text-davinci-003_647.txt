I had just landed my first job at an office and I was excited to show off my mad office skills. On one particular day, I got put on a project that seemed pretty simple and straightforward, but I ran into more than a few road blocks. The final part of the project entailed entering data into a very complicated spreadsheet with rows and rows of information, and another task was to match up information and compile a report. 

I was struggling to get the spreadsheet to work properly and I felt very frustrated and ready to give up. Then my manager, Jane, stepped in and offered her help. Instead of getting angry or telling me off, she was incredibly patient and understanding of my situation. She explained to me calmly and reassuringly what I needed to do to get the spreadsheet to work and how to finish the project. Despite all the mistakes I made and the time it took me to complete the project, she was very encouraging and supportive.

Thanks to Jane's patience and teaching, I was able to complete the project and learn a lot of useful information in the process. I was able to utilize and develop my skills, and now I look back fondly on my experience. I learned that patience is a powerful tool for helping people learn and grow.
