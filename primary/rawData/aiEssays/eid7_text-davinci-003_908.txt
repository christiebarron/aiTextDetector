I was in line one evening at a grocery store, waiting to check out. The store was quite busy and the person ahead of me had a lot of items. They were taking a while, with the cashier having to double check prices and take a few items out of the cart. I could already feel the impatience mounting in me but I decided to stay put and wait. 

I thought about how congested the line was and how I'd likely have to wait for my turn for a long time. Despite these thoughts, I decided to stay put and stay patient. I kept myself busy scrolling through my phone and continued to wait. I managed to stay patient and calm even as the line got longer by the minute. 

After what felt like an eternity, the person ahead of me was done and I moved ahead in line. By the time I finally got to the checkout, I was feeling so relieved for not reacting in impatience. Patience can be challenging but it's definitely rewarding in the end.
