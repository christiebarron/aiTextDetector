The building of the Empire State Building marked a great engineering accomplishment that has stood the test of time. However, the ambitious plans of the builders didn’t stop at just constructing a large building; they also envisioned the possibility of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the building’s upper levels. This concept presented a set of unique challenges, as Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes in her article, “The Mooring Mast.” 

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was creating a proper space and infrastructure for the airships to use. To accommodate airships, the builders had to construct a mooring mast to serve as a platform for the dirigibles to dock. It had to be sturdy, yet lightweight enough to be attached to the upper portions of the building without compromising its structural integrity. It also had to be tall enough for the airships to dock safely and located in a way that helped mitigate risks when the airships moved up and down. 

The second challenge was making sure the structures that enabled dirigibles to dock were suitable for frequent use. The architects and engineers had to design and construct a safe launch and docking area, as well as the necessary technologies and infrastructure to allow for the transfer of people and cargo. This included the rigging, ballast, and mooring lines for the airships. Furthermore, workspaces for dirigible personnel needed to be included, to ensure that everyone involved in the docking process did so safely and efficiently.
