Once, I was waiting in line to buy tickets for a show that I had been dying to see. The line got really long and I started to get really impatient because I wanted to make sure I got the tickets before they sold out. But, then I remembered that I should practice being patient. I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself that the line would eventually move, and the people around me deserved respect for the same reason I was there, to get tickets. I waited patiently for about an hour, and when I finally made it to the front of the line, I was relieved to find out that tickets were still available. I learned that day that patience is a virtue and can prevent some unnecessary distress.
