Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a powerful and evocative mood throughout. Rodriguez explores themes of family, identity, belonging, and acceptance as he takes readers through his journey of self-discovery and what it means to be “home”.

Rodriguez creates a melancholic and somber mood as he recounts his childhood, growing up in a poor Puerto Rican family living in New York. He documents his struggles of feeling different and being unwelcome, both at home and in the world at large. His reflection of these experiences is deeply touching and often heartbreaking, as he recounts being shamed for his color of his skin, his accent and his minimal belongings in comparison to his classmates. 

Rodriguez's journey also poignantly heartbreaking, as he unveils the complexities his family faced, but was never allowed to discuss openly. As he faced abandonment and loss, his need to “belong” and to finally be accepted, became even more acutely painful. 

Despite the heavy subject topics and profoundly sad moments that populate the memoir, Rodriguez never lets the mood of the memoir become oppressive. He captures moments of levity and moments of joy which serves to break up and lighten up the more somber scenes. 

Ultimately, the mood of the memoir captures a strong sense of nostalgia, reflection, and understanding. Although the narrative veers to times of sadness, the stream of emotions evoke a deeply meaningful narrative which profoundly reflects upon the ideas of family and belonging.
