The Empire State Building has been an icon of New York City for many years, in part because of its ability to host various modes of transportation. In particular, the building was originally built with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock at the mast located at the top of the building. However, building the mast to accommodate flying ships presented a number of obstacles that the designers of the building had to overcome.

The first challenge was selecting the proper material for the mast since the structure would need to be strong enough to support the large ships. After considering a variety of options, steel was ultimately chosen due to its superior strength and durability. This was an ideal choice for the part of the mast that extended up from the top of the building. The problem arose when an additional piece of the mast had to be designed to extend outward and attach to the ship. The designers concluded that high-strength steel presented too much of a weight issue, so they decided to utilize a lighter material to support the extension.

The second challenge the designers faced was determining the proper dimensions for the mast.  Fortunately, due to the availability of airship construction plans featuring exact measurements, the architects were able to determine the optimal length and width of the mast. Next, the engineers needed to figure out how to secure the mast to the building. After studying a variety of possibilities, they decided to anchor the mast to the structure using four large cables. This solution proved to be the most reliable and effective.

The final hurdle came in the form of securing permission from governmental authorities to operate a mooring mast at the top of the building.
