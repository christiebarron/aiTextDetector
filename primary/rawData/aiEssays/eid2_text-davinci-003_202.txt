Censorship in libraries should never be considered lightly, as it can have a detrimental effect on freedom of expression, the availability of knowledge and personal growth.

It may also deny individuals the opportunity to critically examine different topics and concepts, which is essential for personal and intellectual growth. 

In some cases, it may be appropriate to have censors in place for certain materials, such as those which are too explicit for children or at-risk youths.
