One of my oldest and truest friends is the kind of person who can light up a room with their laughter. We've been friends since childhood, so I'm familiar with just how contagious her laughter can be.

I was visiting her recently, and we had chatted for a while when she suggested that we go for a walk together. As we walked along, she began to tell me a story – some silly anecdote that I had heard before. As she narrated the story, she started to laugh, her eyes sparkling and her body shaking with every chuckle.

I started to giggle too, as I tried to picture the scene she was describing. Before I knew it, we were both doubled over in laughter, trying to catch our breath. Onlookers began to pass by and give us strange looks, but we couldn’t help but laugh.

We couldn’t be stopped – our laughter was an unstoppable force. As we stumbled back home, still laughing, I knew that our friendship would never be forgotten. Laughter will always bring us closer, no matter the distance between us.
