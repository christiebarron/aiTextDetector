The construction of the Empire State Building was an ambitious undertaking, and the inclusion of a docking station for dirigibles was a testimony to its grandiosity. However, the arrival of rigid airships challenged the builders of the Empire State Building in ways that they could not have anticipated. The difficulty of the task is evidenced in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article, ‘The Mooring Mast’.

The biggest obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was simply that no technology existed that allowed airships to safely dock to a building. Unlike docking a boat to a pier, the only suitable methods for a mooring mast involved elaborate engineering procedures. The engineers had to build obstacles for the dirigibles to avoid the skyscraper, establish a powerful wind shield to keep the mast secure, mount steel cables to absorb the force of the airships, and calculate the exact angle for the mast itself.

Further challenges included ensuring that the mooring mast was strong enough to support the airships, yet flexible enough not to break under their considerable weight. To compound matters, the mooring mast also had to remain functional in high winds, since dirigibles naturally tried to move away from the mast in gusty weather. To accommodate the massive size of the dirigibles, the base of the mast had to be wide enough to hold several of the airships, while still incorporating necessary safety features.

Finally, the builders had to ensure that the Empire State Building remained stable and secure while airships were moored. This meant that the entire building had to be tested and
