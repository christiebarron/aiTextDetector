I recently had an opportunity to practice patience when I was in the grocery store. I was already in a hurry to get to my next appointment, and I queued up to pay for my items. Unfortunately, the person in front of me seemed to be having some trouble with their payment and the cashier was having to repeatedly ask them for more information. Though my patience was wearing thin, I reminding myself that everyone is human, and I can be understanding. The cashier eventually worked out the issue and my turn came up. Even though I was running late, I still thanked them for their help before I took my leave.
