I remember the time I was visiting my elderly neighbor, Mrs. Smith. I had been talking to her on the phone every week since she had broken her hip and could no longer make the short walk over to my house. Every week I asked how she was doing, but this one week she was quiet, and there was a strange atmosphere.

When I visited her that week, I was met with a tired look in her eyes. I could tell she was struggling. I lightly asked her what was wrong, but she didnâ€™t give me a direct answer. I was patient and instead of pushing her, I asked her if she would like a cup of tea. That seemed to do the trick, as she said yes and started to tell me what was on her mind.

It turned out that Mrs. Smith was beginning to come to terms with the fact that she could no longer take care of herself, that she needed help. I listened empathically, not judging nor offering opinions. I believed she just needed a listening ear and the understanding that I was there for her.

I stayed with her until I knew she felt a bit better, and at that moment I felt so proud of myself that I was able to stay patient and just listen.
