The ending of Minfong Ho's "Winter Hibiscus" serves as a reminder of the importance of determination, resilience, and perseverance. Through the story we follow Uma, a student who, despite studying hard and putting in the effort, performs poorly on her first Algebra test. Rather than get discouraged, however, she decides to try again explaining to her anxious mother that "some things just take more time". The conclusion of the story is a deep exploration of the idea that failure is not an end, but a challenge to keep pushing forward. 

Uma's story illustrates that success often requires stepping outside of our comfort zone and taking risks. This concept is reflected in the phrase "When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again." The imagery of the tree budding and the migratory birds returning to the area serves as a reminder of the renewal associated with the changing of seasons. In the same way, Uma must remain strong and keep pushing forward despite the difficulties she's facing with the Algebra test. 

By ending the story this way, Ho encourages us to never give up in the face of adversity and to keep pushing towards success. As we can see in Uma, hard work and determination are the keys to achieving our goals, no matter how challenging the task may seem. Through her example, Ho demonstrates that anything can be accomplished if we are willing to put in the effort and remain diligent.
