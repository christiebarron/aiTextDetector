The task of engineering one of the world’s most iconic buildings, the Empire State Building, was certainly no walk in the park for the builders, particularly in terms of equipping the building to accept the docking of dirigibles. There were a number of obstacles and challenges that had to be overcome before the Empire State Building, then the world’s tallest building at 102 stories, was ready to accept aerial traffic.

The first of the obstacles was creating a suitable mast for the landing of dirigibles, which would eventually be named the “Mooring Mast”. The mast itself was particularly difficult to construct due to its position on the uppermost parts of the building and the need to consider wind conditions due to the huge volume of the every growing dirigibles. It was also essential that the mast had to be made with lightweight and both rigid and resilient materials that could withstand the huge brunt of the larger dirigibles.

The second obstacle was to determine the exact configuration of the landing system that would need to be installed on the building to accommodate gusts of wind. This posed a huge engineering challenge as the must be able to capture the gasses from the dirigible’s engines, disperse the heat, and absorb the vibration, shock, and other vibration issues that come along with docking a large, heavy dirigible. The engineers also had to consider the fact that the system should be able to bar around bulky wingspan and ensure the overall structural integrity of the Empire State Building.

The final technical obstacle was designing and installing a winch motor capable of hoisting the solid
