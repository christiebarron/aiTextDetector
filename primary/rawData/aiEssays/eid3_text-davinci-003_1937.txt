The features of the setting in ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski have a great impact on the cyclist. The circumstances of the cyclist’s journey and the environment of the journey’s route heavily affect the cyclist’s experience. 

The setting of a desert road provides the cyclist with a physically demanding environment; the heat, rocks, and dust make the cycling strenuous. These elements of nature are out of the cyclist’s control, creating a grueling challenge for the cyclist to face and making the journey even more difficult. As the cyclist climbs the hills and descends the valleys, the difficulty of the terrain changes and presents different challenges for him to overcome. The long stretches between water, food, and rest also make the journey tough.

The surrounding landscape of the desert, also described as “bleak,” gives the cyclist few opportunities for distraction and allows for contemplation as he cycles. The vast space of the desert causes the cyclist to focus inwards, leading him to confront his own thoughts and emotions as he cycles. The barrenness of the desert also serves to underscore the scale of the cyclist’s task and the difficulty of his challenge.
