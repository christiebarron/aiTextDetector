Dear Editor,

As technology advances, so too does the effect that computers have on people. It has become clear that computers profoundly affect our lives in all aspects. From our relationships with one another to our careers, computers have changed many aspects of our lives.

On the one hand, computers have greatly increased our access to information. We are no longer limited by geographical boundaries or the availability of certain materials. Thanks to computers, we have access to information at a level that would have been unimaginable only a few decades ago. We also have the ability to communicate with people across the globe and stay connected with family and friends.

On the other hand, computers have also changed how we interact with others. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to less physical relationships and can cause people to become more isolated from others. Additionally, computers can make work-life more difficult. Many jobs that used to be done by hand are now done by computers, leading to more reliance on technology and less emphasis on manual skills.

Overall, I believe that computers are the greatest invention in modern times. They have allowed us to access knowledge and communicate in ways we never thought possible. That said, they should be used in moderation. Too much reliance on computers can lead to negative consequences and cause our interpersonal relationships to suffer.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
