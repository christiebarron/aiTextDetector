Building the Empire State Building was one of the most famous construction projects of the twentieth century, but not many people know that it was also designed to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. Constructing this building and enabling the docking of the airships presented a unique set of challenges to contractors, engineers, and architects.

The main challenge was to ensure the structural integrity of the tower to accommodate the heavy weight of the dirigibles. To accomplish this, the Empire State Building’s designers increased the center’s steel support beams to provide extra stability. The beams were put in place to bear the weight of both the ship and the reinforced steel mooring mast that had been designed to extend to the sixtieth floor.

Another obstacle was the installation of the mooring mast. This mast was designed to allow dirigibles to latch onto it like a buoy and keep the airships from swinging in the wind. The mast had to be installed securely, without compromising the tower’s stability and without metal fatigue, which required precise welding techniques. Because of the length of the mast, workers had to climb 113 stories to reach the top of the tower. This presented a safety hazard, as the workers would have to ascend over 700 feet in the air.

The last obstacle the builders faced was forecasting the wind direction and speed accurately to ensure ships could safely dock. To solve this issue, a special wind indicator was installed at the top of the mast that could provide wind direction and speed readings. A wind vanes and technical instruments were also added to provide more accurate wind
