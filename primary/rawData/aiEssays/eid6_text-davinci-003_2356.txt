The construction of the Empire State Building presented an impressive challenge to its builders in 1930, particularly in regards to providing a safe means of docking and mooring dirigibles, or large airships, which would be a key feature of the structure. Overcoming the technical, design and engineering challenges to constructing the Empire State Building was one thing, but the biggest challenge of the mooring mast was providing the infrastructure necessary to ensure the safe arrival and departure of the large and relatively unstable airships. 

In The Mooring Mast, author Marcia Amidon Lüsted recounts the challenges faced by the designers and engineers of the mooring mast. One of the biggest challenges was the lack of knowledge of dirigibles as a means of transportation. As Lüsted explains, “the engineers had little experience in designing a tall tower specifically to moor an airship, and what was known of the technology of airships was still in its infancy”. They had to learn how to stabilise the airships, how to make the mechanical connections, and how to adjust the mooring mast to accommodate the varying lengths of dirigibles.

The engineers also had to contend with the structural integrity of the mooring mast, which had to withstand gusts of wind and other extreme weather conditions while the airships were docked. They had to design a structure that was both light enough to handle the load of the dirigibles, but also strong enough to resist the forces of nature and of a large airship. They also encountered difficulty in determining the tension of the cables and ropes that were
