In ‘Rough Road Ahead’, Joe Kurmaski describes the difficulty of navigating a rugged terrain on a bicycle. The setting of the story – from the sharp turns and rough surfaces, to the varied weather and changing light – influences the cyclist’s experience in several ways.

First, the sharp turns and rough surfaces are tiring and potentially dangerous, increasing the risk of an accident. They force the cyclist to keep their focus and attention throughout the ride, as their fatigue increases in direct proportion to their distance. These features can also slow down the cyclist, significantly extending the length of their journey. Therefore, the cyclist must pay close attention to their stamina to prevent a breakdown while they navigate the hazards of the terrain.

The varied weather also presents challenges, particularly during wet days, when the roads become slick and hidden pitfalls emerge. Similarly, the changing light makes it difficult for the cyclist to see their surroundings and make the right decisions. It can also lead to an increase in fatigue due to the amount of concentration needed to accurately assess the road conditions.

Finally, the overall landscape of the setting contributes to the visual experience of the cyclist, providing a panorama of nature’s beauty. This
