The Empire State Building was built with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. However, this initiative faced several difficult obstacles along the way. In The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains that the primary obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock were the size of the building itself, the crosswinds in the area, and the presence of the Chrysler Building close by.

To begin with, the sheer size of the building was a major challenge to the Empire State Building’s ability to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. Constructing a building of this stature was a daunting task in and of itself, let alone equipping it with the necessary features to efficiently accommodate the docking of airships.

The location of the Empire State Building posed a second obstacle to the docking of dirigibles. The airship captains had to contend with the particular winds of the area that could influence the path and speed of the dirigibles. In addition, the presence of the nearby Chrysler Building would also have an impact on the accuracy and safety of the docking process.

Finally, safety was of primary concern with regards to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. While airships had been used to dock at a variety of locations around the world, the Empire State Building was a particularly unusual case due to its height and the presence of the Chrysler Building close by. In order to ensure the safety of passengers and crew onboard the airships, the docking systems had to be equipped with superior safety measures.
