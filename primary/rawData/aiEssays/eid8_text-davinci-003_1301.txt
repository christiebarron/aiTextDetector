I'll never forget the time I shared a laugh with my best friend. We had just finished a long day of studying for exams, and we were both exhausted. We decided to head to a nearby cafe for some coffee and relaxation. When we arrived, the barista greeted us with a sense of familiarity. He asked us how our exams had gone and commented that he was sure we'd done quite well.

At first, my friend and I were a bit surprised by his good-natured assumption. But then he said, “I know you two can do it. After all, you're the smartest people in the class – everyone talks about it.”

At first we were shocked, and then we both started to crack up. We laughed so hard that we were almost in tears. The barista tried to stifle his own chuckles, probably thinking that we had found his comment awkward, but we just kept laughing.

Needless to say, it was the best coffee break I ever had. That moment taught me the immense joy that laughing with someone can bring. It's a reminder that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
