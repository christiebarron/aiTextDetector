To the editor:

As technology advances, computers have become even more prevalent in our lives. There is no doubt that computers are incredibly helpful tools, but their effects on people are the subject of many debates.

On the one hand, computers often reduce paperwork and streamline mundane, time-consuming tasks. They also streamline communication between people in different parts of the world. However, on the other hand, computers can cause people to become disconnected from the physical world and even other people. A small amount of time spent interacting with a computer can cause an individual to forget how to interact with physical objects and even people. Overuse of computers can lead to feelings of isolation and depression.

It should be clear that there are both positive and negative effects that computers have on people. The key is to find a balance that acknowledges the nuanced relationship we have with computers. By using them to complete necessary tasks, communicate efficiently, and access information, people can also maximize the positive attributes of computers while making sure to prioritize their interactions with the physical world and other people. 

I hope this letter has shown the readers why it is important to find a balance between physical and computer interactions. When done correctly, computers can make our lives much easier and more enjoyable.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
