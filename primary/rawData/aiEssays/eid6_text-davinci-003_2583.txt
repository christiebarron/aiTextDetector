The idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was a long-held dream of many engineers and architects. However, it was an endeavor that was fraught with many obstacles and ultimately led to the idea being abandoned. In the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, some of the main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock are outlined. 

The first major obstacle was the structure of the building itself. The original design of the Empire State Building did not feature the signature mooring mast for dirigibles. The tower was initially too short and too thin to safely accommodate the rigors of docking such aircrafts. This design flaw was noted during the early stages of the project and it forced the engineers to rethink the entire building layout, significantly increasing the cost of the project. 

Another problem was the ability of the dirigibles themselves to dock at the Empire State Building. While it was possible to design a mooring mast that was strong enough to dock the airships, the dirigibles themselves had to endure some significant modifications in order to compete with the stringent safety standards of the day. The dirigibles were tested to make sure that their mooring ropes could withstand the rigors of docking the hulking aircraft to the mooring mast. Furthermore, the dirigibles had to be modified structurally so that their gondolas could properly align with the mooring mast. 

Finally, one of the most significant impediments to the docking of dirig
