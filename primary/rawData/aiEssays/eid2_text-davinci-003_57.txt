Recently, debates about censorship in libraries have been circulating around the community. These debates have sparked controversy over what materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be allowed on library shelves. Many people are trying to make the argument that if certain materials are found to be offensive then they should be removed from the library. 

This opinion is misguided and completely outdated. Libraries should be safe havens of knowledge and exploration; they should not be limited to a certain set of views or opinions. Censorship in libraries is a form of suppression that contradicts the values that libraries were founded on. 

Rather than suppressing individuals’ access to material, libraries should be embracing the concept of allowing access to materials that some may find offensive. Not being able to access material can cause individuals to lack understanding and knowledge of the many diverse issues that affect us in today’s society. 

If libraries are to remain a safe source of knowledge, then it should be up to individuals to decide which materials they would like to access. With the advancements of the internet, it is easy to find any type of material that suits an individual’s interests. Libraries should provide the space for those interested in accessing this content a safe place to do so.

Overall, the idea of censorship in libraries is a dangerous one that could lead to the stifling of valuable knowledge. Libraries should be a place where people can explore their interests without the fear of censorship. Libraries should abide by the standards of knowledge that they were created with, not those created by the opinions of individuals.
