The ending of Minfong Ho’s ‘Winter Hibiscus’ poet leverages imagery of nature to emphasis the speaker’s message of resilience and growth. The poem ends with the speaker declaring their confidence in a personal situation—taking a test again—by tying it to the return of spring and the blooming of a hibiscus. Through this hidden symbolism, the speaker is equating their own growth to the natural life of the hibiscus, teaching readers that even the harshest winters will eventually give way to rebirth. 

This poem seeks to encourage readers to find hope in the same transience of nature, as the speaker does. Throughout the poem, Ho references metaphors of death, coldness and winter’s barrenness, but balances these with the warm tones of a new season and a hibiscus that “bursts like a flame”. She positions the winter as merely a stopping point, not an end to growth, and uses the hibiscus blooming in spring as a reminder of nature’s transformative power. 

The speaker’s promise to “take that test again” when the spring comes is a statement of resilience. Despite being surrounded by icy winds and death-like snow, the speaker remains determined to push through their struggles and continues to hold onto their goals. Even when faced with uncertainty and pain, they remain optimistic that growth and prosperity await them in the spring if they try.
