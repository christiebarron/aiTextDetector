Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effect computers have on people. I believe that computers are one of the most important inventions of all time, and their impact on our lives is undeniable. 

To start with, computers allow for quick and efficient communication. Whether we are chatting with family and friends, connecting with potential employers, or just searching for information. With a few clicks, anyone can get the information they need and instantly connect to people around the world. 

Perhaps the biggest advantage of computers is their ability to help us access countless resources. Whether itâ€™s school projects, research materials, or educational programs, computers make it easy to access information anytime, anywhere. They can also be used to boost productivity, making it easier to complete tasks faster and at a lower cost. 

On the flip side, there are certain drawbacks to using computers. They can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, as people are more likely to sit in front of the computer for extended periods of time. Additionally, too much time spent on the computer can lead to feelings of isolation, particularly for children and teenagers. 

Overall, computers undoubtedly provide convenience and access to a world of knowledge and information from the comfort of our own homes. It is important to remember, however, that computers should be used responsibly and in moderation.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
