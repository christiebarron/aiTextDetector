I remember it like it was yesterday. I was out with my long-time friend and we were discussing an old memory, chuckling and giggling away. We were walking along the pier, watching the waves crash against the shore, and I was pausing periodically to drop a pebble in the water and see how far it travelled. 

Suddenly, I dropped a particularly light pebble, and it only travelled a few inches before it stopped dead in its tracks. I was baffled and my friend started to laugh. I scrunched my nose up and said, "What in the world was that?" We couldn’t stop laughing.

Then I remembered a moment from a few years earlier when we had seen a tiny pebble and tried to figure out what it was. We both ended up laughing so hard that we had tears streaming down our faces. We both realised at the same time that I had just dropped the same pebble I had been trying to figure out so many years ago.

It was a quiet moment, yet it was so funny and filled with warmth. It was a moment of laughter and camaraderie that I’ll never forget. It was a reminder that laughing and having fun with someone is one of the greatest joys in life, and ahappiness shared can be multiplied.
