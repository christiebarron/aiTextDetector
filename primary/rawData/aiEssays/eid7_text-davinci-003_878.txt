As I was on my way home from work one day, I noticed a large traffic jam up ahead. I drove closer and saw that the traffic jam was caused by a car accident further up the highway. I was already running late for dinner so I had to make the decision to wait in the traffic instead of turning around and taking a different route. 

Although my patience was tested and I was getting frustrated, I decided to stay put and remain patient. I decided to put on some soft music and try to calm myself down. I also tried to be understanding as there were first responders on the scene and they were probably doing their best to help.

The traffic eventually started to move, but it took a few hours before I finally made it back home. It was a long and trying few hours, but I am glad that I was patient and chose not to make the situation worse by trying to cut in or be aggressive. My patience ultimately paid off and I am grateful for that.
