The builders of the Empire State Building went through a number of challenges in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock. The most paramount among these challenges was the practical implementation of the mooring mast, which had never been attempted before. The mooring mast was an engineering endeavor of its own, requiring a massive undertaking and the utilization of many resources.

The designers of the mast were tasked with securely anchoring the mast to the top of the Empire State Building, as well as safely connecting the mast to seven different dirigibles at the same time. The mast included a steel platform which extended out from the top of the Empire State Building and was approximately 421 feet above the ground.  To ensure the mast could safely handle the load of the dirigibles, its designers constructed two specialized cables of heavy steel that were secured to two points on the mast and ran diagonally to the ground to hold it in place.

In addition to the physical engineering work needed for the mooring mast, the creators also had to address safety concerns. Firstly, the mooring mast was located high in the air, which prompted important discussions about air traffic regulations and the potential risks of aircrafts colliding with dirigibles. As such, they put measures in place to alert both pilots and dirigible captains of their presence and to ensure that aircraft and dirigibles stayed separated in the sky. Also, the mooring mast had to be equipped with special tools to help control the dirigiblesâ€™ descent and ascent speeds, as well as an air cushion to absorb the force of the gusts of wind
