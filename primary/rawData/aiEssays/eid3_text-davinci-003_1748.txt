The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski adds to the cyclist’s difficulty and adds to the story's tension. The setting is an abandoned road in the mountains of Pennsylvania, the terrain is cold, rugged, and extremely hilly, with balding tires, dangerous curves, and a treacherous way down. 

The cyclist is physically and mentally challenged by the setting in the story, but is still determined to reach his destination. The rider has to ride through clouds of toxic smoke, dealing with an unpredictable road surface, and constantly making sure he does not lose control. The cold air forces the rider to tense up and pull tightly on the handlebars in order to maintain his balance, making it even more difficult to navigate the curvy road. 

The cyclist also has to deal with another challenge of the setting - the fact that there is no one he can trust. He is alone and does not know who could help him if he gets in trouble. The loneliness of the setting adds to the story’s tension and makes it even more thrilling for the reader. 

The treacherousness of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It is difficult for him to move forward
