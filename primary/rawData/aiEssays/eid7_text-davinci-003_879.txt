I recently went on a road trip with my extended family and I was worried that it would be chaotic, with so many of us in the car and all. I was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't as bad as I thought. My family was surprisingly patient throughout the drive, waiting patiently for everyone to get into the car, with no one complaining about how long it was taking. We also had a few stops for bathroom breaks and even though no one was happy about them, we were all patient and understanding of the need for them. It was a long journey but somehow we all managed to stay calm and work together. I was really impressed with my family's patience and it made the entire trip much more enjoyable.
