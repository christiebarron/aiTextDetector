The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when attempting to make the building suitable for docking dirigibles. This was due to the modern steel-frame construction of the building's exterior, combined with its enormous height, making it difficult to implement changes to the structure. Despite the obstacles, the designers of the Empire State Building were determined to make it the first structure in the world capable of docking dirigibles.

The primary obstacle with which the builders had to contend was the lightness and flexibility of the airships. Dirigibles needed to be able to be tethered to the building so that they could move as the wind changed direction and also land in gusty conditions. This necessitated attaching mooring masts to the roof of the Empire State Building, at a height of 1,504 feet, or 453 meters, above the ground. The mooring masts were 100 feet in length and were made of stainless steel tubing and welded to large steel plates. This then had to be secured to the Empire State Building; an extremely difficult task.

The builders had to devise a way to transfer the mooring mast to the roof, which had to take into account the wind conditions that the dirigible would be navigating and the strength of the mooring mast. They were also charged with the task of finding a way to keep the roof strong enough and hardy enough to bear the weight of the mooring mast and airships, ensuring that all of the other parts of the structure were protected. The engineers consulted aeronautical experts and devised a plan, involving the
