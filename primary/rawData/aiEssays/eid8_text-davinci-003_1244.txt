As I sat down to dinner with my family I could feel the tension rising. It had been an especially trying day, and no one seemed to have the energy or patience to stay focused on one particular topic. I was just about to suggest that everybody turn in early when my brother unexpectedly let out a loud burp. We all stopped, eyes wide with surprise before erupting in a fit of uncontrollable laughter. 

That laugh was like a pressure valve release. All of the stress of the day dissipated in that moment. As we continued to laugh, I could feel the warm glow of good-natured ribbing and comfort that comes with being truly close to the people you love. I found myself relaxing and letting go, surrounded by the people I trust the most.

Our laughter continued for several minutes and eventually transformed into a light-hearted conversation about the day's events. We chattered about the funny moments and consoled each other about the tougher ones. It was an incredibly healing experience, to be able to laugh so freely and share our thoughts in an atmosphere of hope and joy. 

As I retired to bed later that night I was filled with a warmth and contentment that had been desperately missing earlier that evening. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people, allowing us to come together in moments of shared joy and understanding.
