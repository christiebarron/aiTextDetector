I had a long day at work, so when I got home, I wanted to relax on my couch with a good book and some quiet music. My two kids had different plans; they were running around the house screaming and playing. I knew the situation could quickly spin out of control if I didnâ€™t intervene.

Deep breaths helped me remain patient in the heat of the moment. I gently reminded the kids that we were all tired and needed some quiet. Then I took a few calming deep breaths and told myself to stay calm. 

Rather than yell or resort to anything drastic, I took the approach of asking the kids what they wanted to do and allowing them to use their voices in respectful and calm ways. We ended up playing a board game together and taking a little break from the stress of our day.

It was a wonderful reminder of the power of patience. Taking the time to remain calm and thoughtful enabled us to have some quality family time despite our tiredness and to come away feeling better than when we started.
