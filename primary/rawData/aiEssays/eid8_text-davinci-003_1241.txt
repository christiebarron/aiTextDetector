I remember it like it was yesterday. I had gone over to my friend’s house for Saturday dinner and we had decided to play a few rounds of cards. We were both so competitive, so we ended up in a heated argument about who was going to win the game when suddenly we both realized how ridiculous we sounded and the absurdity of it all. We both started to laugh hysterically and the more we did, the funnier the whole situation seemed. 

It was one of those moments where I felt like I could truly let go and be myself, knowing that laughter was more important than winning. I was grateful for the moment and realized what an important role it plays in relationships – laughter can help us move beyond any disagreements or differences and connect us on a deeper level. 

From that moment onward, laughter became an essential part of our relationship. Whenever we argued, we reminded each other of that special moment and let it carry us back to a place of understanding and close connection. 

No matter what, laughter has been the glue that holds us together and I am forever thankful for it!
