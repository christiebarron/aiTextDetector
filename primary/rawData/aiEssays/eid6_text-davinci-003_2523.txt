The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock on the landmark skyscraper’s spire. The most significant of these came from structural and engineering considerations, as the complex and precarious task of docking a giant airship to the building’s top posed significant challenges. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted wrote in her book The Mooring Mast, “The idea was that dirigibles would land on the building, with the process of mooring assisted by a 68-foot steel mast atop the skyscraper.”

The sheer size of the vessel and the building required that the dock be able to hold the airship steady while passengers disembarked and the crew re-supplied. To this end, engineers had to devise special stabilizing mechanisms, such as a steel girder on a system of pulleys, to ensure that the mast remained secure against the wind and both the ship and the building were not damaged during the process. 

Other challenges arose from ensuring the safety of passengers and crew. As it was a commercial endeavor, dirigible operators were looking for a reliable and efficient way to approach the docks. This necessitated the introduction of safety measures such as proper lining of the landing area with multiple mooring cables and the mooring post equipped with guides, so that pilots could maneuver the ship with confidence. 

Finally, there were practical considerations in the form of building modifications. To make room for the mast on the observation deck, architects had to rework the existing floor plan, while the smaller elevator shafts of the skysc
