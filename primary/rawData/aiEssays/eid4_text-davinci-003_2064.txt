The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem ‘Winter Hibiscus’ is incredibly powerful. Ho paints an image of the speaker’s determination to take this test again, however difficult and daunting it may be, when the winter has passed. 

The poem speaks of a resilient nature as the speaker, who could feel overwhelmed by the study for the test, instead, finds solace and hope in the unlikely bloom of the hibiscus flower, despite the cold winter. The connections between the hibiscus, the speaker’s journey, and the test can be drawn in that the flower will too, come back in the spring and bloom anew. The poem speaks to the cycle of blossoming that is part of life, where we must be willing to adapt and accept natural change. 

Through her writing, Ho conveys an inspiring message of hope, determination and courage against all odds, in order to reach our forever changing target. She contrasts the idea of the snow’s chill with the warm hope of the poet’s inner spirit, as she promises to take the test ‘again’, having been faced with difficulty the first time. 

Ho invites her readers to accompany the protagonist on her metaphorical journey, echoing the universal idea of renewal and transformation. The winter chill of hardship can be overcome, and the poet in Ho conveys this message eloquently through the winter hibiscus poem. A lasting reminder of the strength and courage to keep trying and adapt, in order to then surge forward, confident of success.
