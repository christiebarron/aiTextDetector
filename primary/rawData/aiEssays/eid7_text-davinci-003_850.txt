I was listening to a child learn how to read at the library one day. She was getting frustrated and her temper was rising. She was getting tired and wanted to give up. I knew she was putting in a lot of effort and I could tell that she was really trying so I stayed patient and calm. 

I sat with her and offered words of encouragement and support. I showed her different strategies to remember the words and how to pronounce them. I told her it was okay if she made mistakes and that she was doing a great job.

The girl kept at it and eventually she was able to finish the book. She was so happy and it was such a wonderful feeling to have helped her reach her goal. Being patient and understanding can go such a long way.
