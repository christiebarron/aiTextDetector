The construction of the Empire State Building, one of the most iconic buildings in New York City, posed tremendous obstacles to the builders which allowed them to create a docking station for dirigibles. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, we learn of the many difficulties they had to overcome in order to facilitate the docking of these huge vessels. 

The foundation of the Empire State Building was the first significant challenge; extensive research had to be done to ensure that the building would be able to safely support the weight of the airships. Engineers had to hypothesize how the mast should be constructed, creating numerous scale models and running multiple calculations before settling on a method. 

The next issue was with the logistics of dirigible design. Most dirigibles created in this era were overly large for the Empire State Building, making it necessary for the designers to alter the building’s dimensions in order to accommodate them. This meant that architects and engineers had to go back to the drawing board and create a new set of specifications, ensuring that the building itself could support the additional weight. 

One of the most difficult sections of the project was constructing the mast itself. This was because the mast had to be constructed in a manner that would securely attach the dirigible to the building, while also allowing the airship to operate under a variety of environmental conditions. After much trial and error, the engineers settled on a design that met the needs of both dirigibles and building. 

In addition to these design difficulties, the builders of the Empire State Building also had to
