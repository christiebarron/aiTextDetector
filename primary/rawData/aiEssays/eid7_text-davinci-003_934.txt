I remember a time when I had to be patient. I was in line at the train station waiting to purchase a ticket. The line was very long and was not moving quickly because the woman at the counter was having difficulty locating the person's ticket information in her system. Everyone was getting visibly frustrated and people began to complain. 

I, however, kept my cool and remained patient. Every few moments I took a step forward in the line and waited for my turn. After what felt like an eternity, I finally made it to the front and was able to purchase my ticket. 

Looking back, I'm proud of myself for staying patient in a potentially stressful situation. Doing so allowed me to reach my destination on schedule and without feeling too anxious.
