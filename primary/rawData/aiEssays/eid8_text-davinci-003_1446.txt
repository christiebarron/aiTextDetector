Laughter has been a major part of my life from the moment I was born. As an only child, I was an easy target for all of the jokes my family would come up with. They taught me early on in life to have a sense of humor, even when things weren't funny.

One particular day stands out in my memory, however. It was the day that my mother and I went grocery shopping. I played along the whole time, as I was use to at home. She was piling me high with tomatoes to carry home, while I continued to make jokes. That must have been funny to an onlooker because the next thing I knew, the manager of the store was standing there laughing with us. He even offered to help out with the grocery bags.

That was the moment when I realized how contagious laughter can be. I was no longer the only one laughing, and the manager made me feel important and appreciated. That day brightened my mood, and I was energized by the physical act of sharing a laugh with someone new.

Even years later, I still feel that same warm feeling each time I laugh with someone. Laughter is one of the most important tools that we have to bridge the gap between two people, especially when you are feeling overwhelmed by thoughts of loneliness.
