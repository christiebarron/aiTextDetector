I was out with a group of friends recently and the conversation got a little bit heated. We were discussing a difficult topic and we all felt very passionate about it. After a few minutes, I could feel the energy in the room shift, so I decided to lighten the mood by telling a joke. My friends all had a good laugh, which helped to break the tension and ease the atmosphere.

As we continued to talk and debate, we found ourselves naturally laughing at each otherâ€™s remarks and observations. It felt like we were no longer arguing about the same subject, but instead, we were having a friendly conversation with each other. Even though there were moments of tension, laughter was able to bridge the gap between us. In that moment, I knew that our friendship was strong and that it could withstand any challenge.
