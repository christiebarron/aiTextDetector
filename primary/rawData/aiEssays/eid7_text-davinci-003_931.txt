I recently had the pleasure of visiting my aunt and uncle's farm. When we first arrived, I noticed that my uncle was having a particularly difficult time managing his livestock. He seemed to be trying every trick in the book and getting a bit worn out in the process.

But then something incredible happened. My aunt stepped in â€“ she took a completely different approach, her voice soft and her movements gentle. She moved towards the animals, genuinely interested in helping. It was a beautiful thing to watch. She was able to successfully guide the livestock where she wanted them to go without using any force or words.

I was deeply humbled by their patience, kindness and gentleness. They could have easily resorted to yelling and other tactics in order to get the job done, but they chose to take the slower and less forceful approach. They're a living example of how patience and understanding can go a long way.
