The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez has a very strong sense of mood throughout which captures the reader’s attention. Rodriguez’s journey of self-completion and self-discovery is told with a combination of using his artistic voice, personal moments, and sense of homecoming. 

The memoir starts off with an introduction to Rodriguez’s life growing up in a small New Jersey town. He recounts the close-knit relationship he had with his family, and how his passion for design and art was nurtured by his supportive parents and teachers. The tone of the memoir is nostalgic and yearning, and in this nostalgic mood, Rodriguez reflects on the life long journey of the Cuban diaspora - which is something that deeply resonates throughout the memoir. 

The atmosphere of tragedy, sadness and bygone days that hark back to Rodriguez’s Cuban roots are very much in the foreground. This is felt in the references to his family members who have passed and in his regret of never being able to return to his home country. Despite the melancholic feeling that is evoked, there is also a sense of appreciation for all the blessings that life has brought him, such as his success as a renowned designer. 

Rodriguez’s memoir really captures the emotions of homecoming and the feeling of self- actualization achieved when finding one's path in life. Through his poignant words, colorful anecdotes and beautiful photography, Rodriguez has painted an enchanting picture on his lifelong journey of creating a home in two worlds.
