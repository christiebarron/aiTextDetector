The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski plays a large role in the cyclist's experience. The setting of the story is a long, desolate road with no protection from the elements. This is important because the lack of trees, buildings, or any form of shelter leaves the cyclist exposed to the elements. The heat of the sun, the cold of the night, and the wind all hit the cyclist and add to the challenge of the ride.

The long, open stretches of road create a sense of isolation and leave the cyclist feeling small in comparison. This forces him to confront his own thoughts and fears, and to push himself harder than he ever thought he could. There is nowhere to hide or rest, so he has to move forward no matter what.

The rough terrain of the road also affects the cyclist. As the road bumps, dips, and twists, the cyclist must constantly adjust the bike to the changing conditions, making it more difficult to maintain balance and momentum. The ever-changing terrain makes it more difficult for the cyclist to make steady progress, as he is constantly having to adjust and readjust.
