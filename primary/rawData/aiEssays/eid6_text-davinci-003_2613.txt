The Empire State Building was the first skyscraper in the world to incorporate a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock. However, this effort was fraught with numerous technical and safety challenges. In her book, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted examines some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Prior to the building’s completion, the mooring mast and the area around it had to be designed to meet both aviation and structural standards. Aviation safety standards included a minimum wind speed requirement and height determined from the building’s highest elevation. The foundation of the mooring mast also had to be powerful enough to hold the dirigibles during their approach and landing. Further, the mast had to have guidance rails and other support components to hold the dirigible body in place.

In addition, the mooring mast was part of a larger set of engineering and safety considerations. The dock must have a solid foundation with guardrails, manways, and access rope platforms to ensure safe and efficient operations. These guardrails would prevent falling debris, wind gusts, and other potential dangers. Further, the mast was attached to the roof of the building by large steel beams, helping to spread and disperse the load of a large dirigible.

Finally, safety precautions were put in place to prevent any fires due to sparks from the airship’s engines. This included the enclosure of the mooring mast and ring system, fireproofing the steel beams holding it in place, and the use
