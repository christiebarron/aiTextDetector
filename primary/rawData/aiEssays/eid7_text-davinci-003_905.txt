I remember one time when I was at the bus stop and had been waiting for over half an hour. My bus was late and I was starting to get frustrated and annoyed. I kept checking for updates on when my bus would arrive, but none of them were accurate. 

At this point, I was really tempted to just give up and take a different form of transportation. However, I decided to try and remain patient. I kept reminding myself that buses will arrive late sometimes and it’s no use getting worked up over something that’s out of my control. 

Sure enough, after another 20 minutes, my bus finally arrived. I was glad that I had taken the time to be patient because if I had given up and left, I would have arrived late to my destination.
