Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a unique narrative that weaves together personal recollections, family history and cultural references to capture a particular mood. The mood that is evoked is a nostalgic yet hopeful one. 

Rodriguez's memoir reflects upon the intense and complex emotions that come with being an immigrant, with his words conveying a sense of longing nestled in a dream of a brighter future. For example, he talks about his father’s success as an immigrant who ‘never looked back’ and his pride in his grandmother’s perseverance in assimilating to her new home. This blend of admiration and wistfulness serves to capture the sentiments of belonging experienced by anyone who has left their home. 

At the same time, Rodriguez’s heartfelt reminiscences of family moments – from acts of kindness to funny stories – bring lightness to the predominantly serious tone. He speaks of his own perception of shared culture, which he describes through his relationships and his own journey. He embraces his culture and his home which together create a sense of security, this security which is felt in the memoir.

This nostalgia is countered by the hopeful atmosphere of the memoir. It is never said outright, but it is implied by Rodriguez’s tone that one day he and his family will return home. This sense of hope for what the future holds is a powerful mood that infuses the memoir.

Overall, Narciso Rodriguez’s From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a heartwarming and compelling memoir that
