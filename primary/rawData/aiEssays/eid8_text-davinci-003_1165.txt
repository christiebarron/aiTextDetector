I was out for a night of karaoke with a group of my closest friends. We had been singing our hearts out for the past few hours and honestly, none of us had the best singing voices. But that didn't stop us from putting on an enthusiastic performance, and it was a lot of fun.

At one point during the night, I was singing one of my favorite songs, “Sweet Home Alabama”. Everyone was singing and clapping along to the song, as I tried my best to hit the notes. I must have done something funny because suddenly the whole group was roaring with laughter.

I was a bit taken aback at first, but then I started to laugh too. I couldn't help but feel good about being the source of so much humor and joy with my friends.

The laughter died down eventually and we returned to singing, but it was one of those moments that felt so special. Laughter may be the shortest distance between two people, but it was that night that I really realized just how powerful it can be.
