I recently had a situation where I had to display patient behavior. I had gone to the doctor's office and was told my appointment had been cancelled without being given any reason why. I was frustrated as this had happened before and I had other plans for my day. 

Rather than become angry, I stayed calm and spoke with the receptionist. I explained the situation and asked her what had happened. She apologized and told me that one of the doctors was out and they were dealing with a backlog of patients. I was understanding and thanked her for the explanation.

Rather than rush off and demand to be seen, I decided to be patient with the doctor's office. I told the receptionist that if they were able to fit me in I would be happy to come back and wait. The receptionist was very grateful and told me they would try their best. As it turns out, they were able to squeeze me in and I was seen by one of the doctors that day. 

This taught me to always remain patient in such situations. It is important to remain calm and remain understanding of the other person's situation, as it can work out favorably in the end.
