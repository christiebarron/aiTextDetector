Censoring books, music, movies, and magazines from libraries is a controversial topic and something that must be addressed with thought and consideration. Libraries should not be censored, as they are important educational and cultural institutions that are vital to the advancement of knowledge and discovery.

Every individual should have the right to access the unedited public domain, and make their own decisions about which materials they consume. Libraries should be free to provide uncensored material to patrons as long as it does not violate any laws or is potentially damaging to society. As such, libraries should provide unbiased resources that are designed to be safe for all viewers. 

Furthermore, censoring materials from library shelves runs contrary to the idea of personal choice. Library patrons have no way of knowing what has been censored, and therefore cannot make informed decisions about the materials they are viewing. Removing materials from the shelves silences the ideas and opinions of individuals who may have a different perspective, and does not allow for an open discussion about the topics presented. 

It is true that some materials can be seen to be offensive. But rather than completely removing these materials, libraries should recognize these works as important contributions to society, and frame them within the context of their own philosophies and values. Libraries should be places of discussion, where patrons can explore and debate controversial topics in a safe and responsible way.

In conclusion, libraries should not be subject to censorship. Libraries are invaluable public institutions that should remain free and open to everyone, and provide a variety of uncensored resources to the public.
