I remember the first time I met my best friend, Daniel. We were in the library, quietly studying when he dared to throw a wad of paper at me from across the room. I didn't take too kindly to him disrupting my concentration, so I gave him an evil eye and went back to my book.

But apparently that wasn't enough to deter him, because before I knew it, he was smiling broadly and letting out a hearty chuckle. I couldn't help but smile back, and the next thing I knew we were both laughing hysterically. The other people in the library were giving us strange looks, but we were so caught up in the moment we didn't care.

It was then that I knew we'd be good friends. Ever since then, laughter has been a special part of our friendshipâ€”whether we're laughing over an inside joke, finding humor in a bad situation, or simply letting out a good belly laugh, it always helps to connect us in a way that nothing else can.
