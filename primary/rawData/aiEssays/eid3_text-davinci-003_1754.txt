In Joe Kurmaski’s story “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist is drastically affected by the features of the setting he encounters. The setting begins in the city, in a part of town that’s bustling with life and activity. The cyclist is criticized by onlookers who view him with scorn and ridicule, clearly exacerbating his negative emotions even before he takes his journey out of the city limits.

It’s once the cyclist leaves the city that the features of the setting really become relevant. The rough and rocky roads, accompanied by sharp turns and jagged curves, present new dangers to the cyclist. He must constantly be aware of his surroundings and of the potential harm faced to himself and his bike. The strong wind, which is at times unruly, adds an extra degree of challenge to the journey.

Moreover, the driverless trains, the huge projections on buildings, and the strange creatures that lurk along the road all add a sense of otherworldliness to the story. This contributes to the cyclist’s already fragile mental state and results in feelings of fear and confusion. The feeling of being constantly watched and monitored further adds to the Cyclist’s anxiety
