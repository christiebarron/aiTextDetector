The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1931, the Empire State Building had not been designed with passengers in mind, yet the proposition of having dirigibles dock there was a tantalizing prospect. Proponents understood that the building could be transformed into a major transit hub if dirigibles could also dock there.

The first obstacle was the size of the building structure. Dirigibles needed a support structure below them in order to land and this was something that had to be designed. The existing building was not tall enough to accommodate a mooring mast, the pole that lift the dirigible up enough to be safely moored in conventionally used. Moreover, the architects behind the Empire State Building had to consider the additional loads that such a mast would place on the buildingâ€™s structure, and ultimately decided to build a separate mooring mast that was totally independent from the main building.

The second obstacle was aesthetics. Any addition to the Empire State Building would have to be in line with the aesthetic principles of the nearby architecture and, in this sense, it was important to design the mooring mast in a way that could be appreciated by both airplane and dirigible passengers. The mooring mast was carefully designed, replete with a steel truss support system, a stay and a funnel-shaped base. Moreover, it was also made of chrome, creating a smooth reflection and providing an aesthetic as pleasing as possible.

The third and final obstacle was public acceptance. Because of the risks associated with large aircraft, many New Yorkers initially had
