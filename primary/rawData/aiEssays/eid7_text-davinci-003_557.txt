I remember back when I was in high school, I had a really tough time staying organized. Each Monday I would forget what assignments I had due and what tests I was supposed to take during the week. One Monday I accidentally forgot to bring the book I needed for a test and the teacher was not very understanding. She was the type of teacher who believed in strict punishment and would generally not tolerate any kind of excuses.

At this point, I was already feeling embarrassed and defeated. However, one of my classmates stepped in and convinced the teacher to give me a chance. She understood that I was having a hard time and agreed to give me an extension on the assignment. I was taken aback by her kindness and understanding and was so grateful that she was so patient with me in this situation. She didn’t have to intervene, but I am so glad she did—it really helped me out in the long run.
