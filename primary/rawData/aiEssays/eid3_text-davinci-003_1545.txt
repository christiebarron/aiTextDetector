The setting of Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski has a huge impact on the cyclist, beginning with the very first biking session. The cyclist is taken on a ride through a mostly desolate area, and the harshness of the terrain makes the ride difficult and dangerous. The sense of isolation conveys to the cyclist the idea that anything can happen out in the wide open, potentially leaving him vulnerable to harm.

The lack of shelter from the elements also forces the cyclist to be one with nature, as every gust of wind and change in temperature increase the difficulty of the route. The natural landscape creates substantial-yet-unknown risks for the cyclist, as the uncharacterized paths that he takes make it difficult to gauge the severity of any obstacles that may be present.

The cyclist is also affected by the lack of infrastructure, as he has no fences, street signs, or traffic lights to indicate where he should turn or what may lie ahead. The roads themselves also take their toll, as deep potholes, cracks, and gravel surfaces create a long and extremely exhausting experience.

The cyclist is challenged in a unique way with every turn of the bike, and the strain of negotiating the uncertainties of their environment is enormous
