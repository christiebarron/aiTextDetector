I was volunteering at a charity event recently and I encountered a situation that required a lot of patience. A few of the volunteers had to stand outside the building and hand out flyers to the passersby. It was a hot, sunny day and many people weren’t interested in what we had to offer. We had to stand there for hours, typically with very little success.

At first, I was getting frustrated and annoyed with all the rejections. But I reminded myself that I was there to help others, not to get my work done quickly. I reminded myself to be patient and think of it as a learning experience. My attitude began to change and I started to enjoy the experience.

For example, when someone didn’t want to take a flyer, I asked them questions to determine why they weren’t interested. I ended up having a lot of interesting conversations with people, which made it a lot more fun and rewarding. I also noticed that more people were interested in taking the flyers when I paused and gave them time to consider it.

Overall, I learned that having patience can be very rewarding. Instead of getting frustrated when things don’t go as planned, I now take a step back and take a positive approach. Doing this can often yield better results than when I’m feeling negative and impatient.
