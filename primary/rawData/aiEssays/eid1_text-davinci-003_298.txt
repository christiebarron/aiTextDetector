Dear Editor, 

In today's world, technology is becoming increasingly more present in our lives. Nowhere has this been more noticeable than in the increased use of computers. Many people are quick to claim that computers are a boon to human productivity and interaction, but I disagree.

I’m sure it’s true that computers save us time and make certain tasks easier. For example, thousands of people recognize the convenience of online shopping, research, and communication. However, I believe that the cons outweigh the pros when it comes to computers. 

Humans are vulnerable to spending too much time in front of screens, resulting in a lack of physical activity, mental languishment, and eye strain. On top of this, the proliferation of computers has made people lazy, as they no longer have to rely on their own knowledge or go out and find information themselves.

The ubiquity of computers has also had an extreme impact on people's privacy. Without the right safety precautions, it has become easy for cybercriminals to gain access to our personal information and misappropriate it for their own gain.

In my opinion, more needs to be done to raise awareness of the challenges posed by technology and its use. We must be aware of the impact it is having on our lives and prioritize our health and security in the face of its advances.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
