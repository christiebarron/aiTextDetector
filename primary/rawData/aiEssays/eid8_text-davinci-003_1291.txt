I remember the first time I met my best friend. We were both new to our college and sitting at the same lunch table. Neither of us knew very many people. We were both a bit shy and unsure of how to start a conversation, so we just sat in awkward silence for what felt like an eternity. 

Finally, I decided to break the silence by cracking a joke about the cafeteria food. We both started laughing, and the ice was finally broken. We talked nonstop for the rest of the meal and even through the walk back to our dorms. We had an instant connection, and from that day on we were inseparable. 

Our friendship has grown immensely over the years. We've been through countless adventures and experienced countless adventures together. Even after all this time, laughter still plays an integral role in our friendship. We may talk and share our sorrows, but whenever we need a pick me up, we just look at each other and crack a joke, and it always brings us back to the same spot - laughing together and sharing an unforgettable moment that we'll always cherish.
