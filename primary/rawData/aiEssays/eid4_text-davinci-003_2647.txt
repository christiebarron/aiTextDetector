The closing line of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho is a powerful and significant one – it ties strongly into the broader themes of the poem, and is a great example of how symbols, images and metaphors can be used to convey powerful concepts.

The protagonist of the poem, a young Chinese-American girl, is struggling with the duality of her cultural identity, her "spinning world" of "dual seasons". The image of a hibiscus, which is a flower that blooms both in winter and in summer, serves as a metaphor for her own identity. The hibiscus remains dormant during the winter months and only blooms in the spring when the climate is warmer and more suitable to it.

This mirrors the protagonist's own journey – during winter months she feels disconnected from both sides of her culture, but slowly starts to regain her connection to them in the warmer months of spring. At the end of the poem, the protagonist expresses a hope that as the snow melts and the geese return, the hibiscus will bloom once again – signifying her hope that her cultural ties will be renewed.The final line of the poem is particularly significant in this sense; when the hibiscus blooms, she wants to take the test again, indicating a desire to reconnect with her heritage, in spite of the difficulties she faced on the journey.

Ultimately, it is a poignant statement of resilience and hope, that no matter what circumstances someone faces, they can overcome them, and come back to reclaim their sense of identity and belonging.
