I was recently in the grocery store when I noticed an elderly woman in the checkout line. She was holding a few items and appeared to be struggling to take out her wallet. As I watched her, I realized she had Parkinson’s and was visibly shaking. Despite this, she was determined to pay for her items. 

My heart went out to her, yet I could feel the impatience of those around me. To them, she was an inconvenience but to me she was a person that needed our help and understanding. So I stepped in. 

I gently tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she needed help. She smiled gratefully and thanked me. I then took her items to the cashier who kindly sent them through the checkout and returned thewoman’s change. 

It was a small gesture, but one that was done with patience, kindess and understanding. In those few minutes, I learnt to be a little more patient.
