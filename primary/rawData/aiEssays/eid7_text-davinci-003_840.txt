I remember the time one of my friends and I were driving through a storm. We had been on the road for hours and the driving was becoming increasingly difficult. Tree branches were blocking some of the roads, and the rain was so heavy that it was almost impossible to see in front of us. I could tell that my friend was getting increasingly frustrated, but he kept his cool and stayed focused on the road. He was incredibly patient, even when I suggested a few times that we stop and stay at a hotel for the night. He just kept calm and kept driving. 

Eventually, the storm subsided and the sun began to come out. We were both incredibly relieved! I'm so thankful for my friend's patience that day. It was the only thing that kept us safe and on the right path.
