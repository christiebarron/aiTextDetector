 

I was out with my friends at a cozy cafe in town, catching up on all the gossip since we last saw each other. As we shared our stories and experiences, we were all so enthralled that none of us realized how much time had passed. Unbeknownst to us the cafe was about to close for the night. To our surprise the owner suddenly banged the table and let out an exuberant laugh. He announced that it was now time for us to leave and reminded us of the time. 

We all burst into laughter, finding his enthusiasm funny. We stood up from our seats, still laughing from his words. As we thanked him for the hospitality, he simply shrugged and said with a twinkle in his eye ‘you’re like family to me’ with a hearty chuckle. We left the cafe feeling content and happy, knowing that our relationship was strengthened through that shared laughter.
