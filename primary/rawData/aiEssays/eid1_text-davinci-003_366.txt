Dear Editor, 

Today, computers are an integral part of our lives. We turn to them for work and leisure, for communication and for entertainment. But what effect do computers really have on people?

I believe that, generally, the effects of computers on people are positive. Computers widen our access to knowledge and resources and can teach us important life skills. They can also enhance our creativity and productivity, allowing us to be more productive, efficient and competitive in our jobs, and even start our own businesses.

Still, the use of computers can have some potential downsides. Spending too much time on the computer can have a negative effect on a personâ€™s physical or mental health. Sitting in front of a screen for extended periods of time can cause back pain, neck strain and other physical issues. If a person spends most of their time working or gaming on the computer, it can also contribute to social isolation, depression and sleep disturbances. 

These risks can be avoided, however, if we use computers responsibly and take regular breaks from them. It is also important to find a balance between spending time on the computer and other activities, such as exercising, meeting up with friends or just taking some time off to relax.

Overall, I think the effects of computers can be positive as long as they are used in a healthy, responsible manner. I strongly believe that the many benefits of computers outweigh the potential drawbacks if we use them wisely.
