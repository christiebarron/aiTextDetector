The goal of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock atop the Empire State Building was an ambitious endeavor that took great engineering and financial obstacles to overcome. Despite this, the dream was very real for many in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The challenge of installing an airship mooring mast atop this iconic structure became an engineering and architectural feat that required creative solutions.

The vision for a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building began with its architect, William F. Lamb. He was enthralled with the idea of offering travelers an opportunity to voyage to the tallest building in the world. His dream was to incorporate a dock for dirigibles that could deposit travelers and mail, however, the logistics and engineering of installing the mooring mast proved too difficult and this plan was put on the backburner.

The construction of the Empire State Building was designed to lessen wind resistance and reduce the overall weight of the structure. This presented unusual problems when considering the potential load of a mooring mast and the need for a sturdy mooring point that could handle the tethering of a large dirigible. The additional weight and the strain of air currents on the mooring mast further complicated the planning process.

The necessary stability of the mooring mast was addressed during the construction of the Empire State Building by reinforcing certain parts of the building and designing a mooring mast that could extend outward from the building rather than relying on the building to bear its weight. This also allowed for both uncovered as well as covered mooring locations on the 81st floor which were
