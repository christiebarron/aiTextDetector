The Empire State Building was designed to accommodate the advent of the passenger dirigible. Despite its grand vision and noble intent, the endeavor was fraught with obstacles that threatened to derail it. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, as revealed in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The Empire State Building was built in an earthquake-prone zone, making it difficult to construct an externally mooring mast for the dirigible. Sturdy weld construction would have been necessary to construct the mast, which would have been made of large steel poles that extended beyond the area of the building’s control. Design and engineering were another challenge. The mooring mast had to be designed and engineered to secure the dirigible while in dock and sustain the heavy pulling force of the takeoff. Additionally, the engineering of the mast had to be able to stand up to high winds and other environmental conditions which posed an unprecedented challenge. These technical problems posed a great challenge to the builders of the Empire State Building.

The cost of the construction and design of the mast was also a major hurdle. Sturdy construction of the mooring mast and its installation would have been costly and difficult to finance. The mooring mast would also have required frequent inspection, maintenance, and repairs. Furthermore, the dirigible’s effects on the building would have been unknown and hard to predict, which carried its own risks.

The most significant obstacle to the mast’s construction, however, was the ever-changing landscape of the air travel industry. The air
