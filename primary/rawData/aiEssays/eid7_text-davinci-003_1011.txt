I was recently taking the subway to work when I realized I had forgot my wallet at home. I was trying to think of a way to get to my destination without using any money when an elderly woman sitting next to me noticed my distress. 

She offered to pay for my fare, and though I was incredibly touched, I told her I couldn't accept her generous offer. She smiled and said "It's alright, it's just a small thing for me to do for someone in need. Take all the time you need." 

I was humbled by her kindness and patience, and we ended up talking for the entire ride. She told me stories about her life, her family, and her travels. I was so grateful for the opportunity to learn more about her, and it made me realize the importance of being patient, especially towards those in need.
