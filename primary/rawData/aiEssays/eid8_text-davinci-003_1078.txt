I remember the first time I shared a true, heartfelt laugh with my best friend. We had been friends for a couple of months, but we both held our own insecurities, not yet comfortable enough to be truly honest and vulnerable with one another. 

One day we were at her house, just chatting and goofing around as we typically did. Suddenly something absurd came up in conversation and I couldn't help but laugh. At first it was a small tentative laugh, but then it exploded into deep belly laughter. I hadn't ever laughed this freely and it felt incredibly liberating. 

My best friend looked at me, eyes wide with surprise and began to laugh louder and harder than she ever had before. She told me later that she'd felt so comfortable around me that she'd been able to let go and really laugh without restraint.

That moment of true, shared laughter opened up a new level of friendship between us. It brought us even closer together, more so than before. We both realized that it was okay to be silly, to make mistakes, and to be vulnerable with one another. 

Since then, we make sure to laugh at least once a day, to remind ourselves how important it is to be completely honest and open with each other. Sharing that laughter makes our friendship stronger every day.
