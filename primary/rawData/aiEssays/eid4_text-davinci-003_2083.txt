The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” speaks to the power of nature and its ability to provide hope, even in the depths of winter. It serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of life; while winter might seem bleak and dreary, beauty and renewal will inevitably prevail.

The poem’s conclusion functions as an epiphany of sorts; the protagonist realizes that nature’s cycles will provide the courage and strength they need to do whatever it is they face. This is suggested in the line “I will take that test” which could be indicative of any challenge or obstacle encountered in life. Regardless of what form it takes, nature will be there to provide solace and hope in its own unique way. 

The imagery used in the poem of a winter hibiscus speaks to the indomitable spirit of the human condition. Despite the cold, dark winter, this flower blooms when all else fades; the vibrant red hibiscus seemingly defying the odds, refusing to succumb to the frosty state of dormancy. This resilience mirrors the inner strength of the protagonist, and in facing the hardships of winter, this strength is fortified. 

By ending the poem with the lines “When they come back in the spring…then I will take that test again” Ho implants a sense of optimism and faith that whatever challenges one faces can be conquered. Through drawing on the power of nature, one can muster the courage and determination to take on any challenges that come their way. Winter Hibiscus
