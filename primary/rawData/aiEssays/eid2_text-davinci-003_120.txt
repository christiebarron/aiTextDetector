Censorship in public libraries has become an increasingly controversial issue in recent years, with some arguing for the removal of material deemed offensive and others vehemently objecting. While I disagree with certain calls for the removing of certain materials from library shelves, I believe that libraries should have the right to choose a restricted selection of materials.

Many believe that censorship in libraries is necessary to protect children and young adults from accessing inappropriate material. However, this fails to recognize the fact that every person has different interests, backgrounds and beliefs, and that one person’s definition of inappropriate may not be another’s. Instead, libraries should have the freedom to determine what is appropriate for the community they serve, while still promoting the freedom of expression and open dialogue. 

Furthermore, the materials chosen should be respectful of the cultural, religious and political backgrounds of the community. If a library wants to limit the selection of books, music, movies and magazines available, it should do so in a way that does not limit access to ideas, but rather guides the community toward an understanding of different ideas. In this way, libraries can foster an environment of respect, understanding and tolerance without barring any individual from accessing any piece of material.

In conclusion, there are legitimate concerns from certain groups regarding what should and should not be available in libraries; however, censorship of material should be granted to libraries on a case-by-case basis. Libraries should be allowed to provide a selection of materials that is respectful of the community, while still maintaining the freedom of speech and open dialogue that is so essential to our society.
