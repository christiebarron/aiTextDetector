In recent years, censorship in libraries has become increasingly contentious. With the rise of modern technology and an array of available information, libraries have adapted to meet the new needs of the public while still adhering to ethical and legal obligations. As a result, there has been significant debate surrounding what materials should or should not be available to library patrons. 

Many argue that libraries should be able to remove any content they find offensive, while others maintain that any type of censorship imposes a restriction on access to information, thereby limiting freedom of expression. As such, the issue of censorship in libraries is complex and multifaceted. 

Censorship in libraries does not necessarily have to be an outright removal of content. Libraries should instead take a more selective approach, in which certain types of materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, are made available to patrons under certain conditions that ensure appropriate usage. For example, parents could be given the option of deciding whether specific books or magazines can be loaned to their children. Similarly, resources that are found to be inappropriate for general audiences can still be made available to those over the age of 18, thereby providing limited access while protecting vulnerable populations from offensive content. 

Ultimately, censorship in libraries should not be seen as a violation of freedom of expression, but instead as a responsible approach to protecting vulnerable library patrons while still providing access to information. By using a more selective approach, libraries can ensure that the public has the resources they need while also protecting the rights of patrons.
