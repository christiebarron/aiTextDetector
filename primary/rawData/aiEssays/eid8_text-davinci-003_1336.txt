I had been friends with David for a few months, but we had yet to really bond and let loose around each other. Then one day, out of the blue, we decided to take a road trip together. We made up a spontaneous song-word mix up game, and every time we’d play, we couldn’t keep from erupting into laughter. We had a blast!

We would make funny rhymes out of alternating verses of whatever song came up on the radio. One time, after we belted out “In the summertime when the weather is fine, don't worry be happy…all your locks need some grease, because they’ll look clunky,” we nearly doubled over in laughter.

That road trip was the beginning of a great friendship between us. Since then, any time we’re together, we can’t help but laugh uncontrollably. That trip bonded us in a way that only laughter can.
