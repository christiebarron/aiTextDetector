I was at a party with a group of my friends when someone suggested playing a game of charades. My best friend, Beth, immediately volunteered to go first. She proceeded to act out her scene so eagerly and enthusiastically that soon the entire room was laughing at her ill-fated attempts to get the answers right.

At one point, she was so lost that she stepped back in deep thought and started to mimic a chicken. We all burst into laughter, prompting Beth to join in. As we laughed away together, I remember feeling so close to her in that moment, even more than before. It was as if our laughter and shared joy had created an invisible bridge that ran between us and connected our spirits.

The game, the laughter and the feeling of pure joy that Beth shared with everyone that day will be something I'll remember for years to come.
