I recently had to return an item to a store and it was a huge hassle. From the moment I got there, I felt like the staff didn't believe me when I said my receipt was at home. Eventually they sent me to the customer service desk to sort out the issue. As I stood in line, I watched as the desk went from 4 people to 10. I could sense the growing frustration of the people around me and I knew I was in for a long wait.

So I just accepted it and found a way to pass the time. I took a few deep breaths, pulled out my phone and started playing a game. I distracted myself for over an hour as the line slowly moved forward. I thought about how annoying it was but never lost my cool. 

Finally it was my turn and I was surprised at how patient the service worker was with me. She understood my situation and worked with me to resolve the issue. I was so relieved and thanked her for her kindness and understanding.

In that situation, I showed a lot of patience. It wasn't always easy but it really paid off in the end.
