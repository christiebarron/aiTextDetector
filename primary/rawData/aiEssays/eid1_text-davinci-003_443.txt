Dear Editor,

As a technology enthusiast and life-long learner, I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Without a doubt, computers have had both positive and negative effects on society.  

On the one hand, computers have revolutionized how we work, learn, and communicate, changing virtually every aspect of our lives. Through the use of computers and other advanced technologies, we can gain access to a wealth of knowledge and tools that have improved productivity as well as our personal lives. They also connect us on a global scale, allowing us to remain informed and connected regardless of geographic limitations.

On the other hand, too much reliance on computers can have negative consequences. With the prevalence of online distractions and interacting with computers instead of real people, it have led to attention deficit and difficulty communicating with others. Furthermore, cyberbullying and online harassment are real phenomena that can cause long lasting negative impacts on the young.

In conclusion, computers are a critical tool for modern life and a great enabler for many, yet our propensity for over-dependence on computers can have serious psychological and interpersonal effects. Therefore, it is important for us to recognize the potential risks and use computers responsibly and in moderation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
