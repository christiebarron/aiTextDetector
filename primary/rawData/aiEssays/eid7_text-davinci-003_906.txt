I recently had the experience of being asked to be exceptionally patient with another person. I was helping a family member complete some complex paperwork for an important legal issue. 

It was becoming increasingly frustrating as my family member was unable to answer a few of the questions on the forms, despite their best efforts. I noticed myself getting frustrated, but I paused to take a few deep breaths and remind myself to be patient. 

I spoke gently and slowly, making sure to explain each question in detail, and even double checking with them to make sure they fully understood. After a few moments of patience, we eventually got all of the paperwork completed together and it was a relief to have it done.

I was proud of myself after that experience because it showed me that patience is a choice, even if it doesn't always come naturally, and that the effort of being patient is worth the positive outcomes it can bring.
