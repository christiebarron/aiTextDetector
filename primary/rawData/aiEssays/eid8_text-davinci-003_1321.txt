I had been friends with my friend Pam for nearly ten years, and we'd always had plenty of laughs and good times together, but this particular summer we'd been apart for a few months due to a crazy work schedule of mine. So when I finally had the chance to meet up with her again I was really excited.

We were catching up and talking about all the things we'd been up to over the last few months, and we both started to laugh thinking of some of the funny times we'd had before. Suddenly, we were both laughing so hard that I was starting to cry, and soon enough she was too! We were in such a fit of laughter that we both ended up rolling around on the floor clutching our sides.

It was then that I realized that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and it gave us a way to reconnect and remember why we were such good friends to begin with. From then on, no matter how much time had passed between us, we always knew that laughter would be the thing that brought us back together again.
