The Empire State Building was the result of a monumental effort to build a skyscraper that could stand the test of time. But one of the most unique features of the building during its time, was its ability to accommodate dirigibles. Constructing a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the building was a daring idea, one that came with significant obstacles to tackle.

Firstly, the mast would need to be taller than the building itself, and strong enough to withstand the forces of the wind and the weight of the airships themselves. This meant that a structure of steel and concrete had to be built that would not buckle under pressure. Due to its height, the building and the mast had to be perfectly balanced and aligned in order to prevent it from toppling. 

A further problem was providing a safe landing and takeoff for the ships. When the mooring mast was in use the wind can create additional drag, causing the tail and lifting fins of the dirigibles to snag on the mast and potentially causing them to crash. Special air cushions were designed to absorb the forces of the wind and reduce the effect of drag, but even with that the motion of the airships had to be carefully monitored and adjusted as they approached the mast.

The engineering involved in making the Empire State Building able to accommodate dirigibles was immense. Design and positioning of the mast had to be considered carefully, and tested to ensure that the structure was safe and secure, and that the dirigibles were not at risk of snagging on the mast during their approach.
