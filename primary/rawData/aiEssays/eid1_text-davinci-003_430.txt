Dear Editor,

Time and again I have heard it said that the introduction of computers into our day to day lives has had a drastic and overwhelmingly positive effect. However, I strongly contend that these effects may not be all that beneficial.

The majority of us spend large portions of our lives in front of our computer screens. For all the entertainment and convenience these devices provide, they can also cause us a great deal of stress. From video game addiction, to cyberbullying and online ludocrats. Studies have concluded that computer-related activities such as these can have detrimental effects on mental health, impacting both physical and emotional well-being.

Furthermore, with many blue-collar workers being replaced by machines, computerization has had a great deal of impact on job security. While lower end jobs may be particularly vulnerable, people of all tactical backgrounds are finding it harder to secure employment, making it far harder for those without specialized knowledge to enter the work-force.

I therefore question the idea that computers are always beneficial. After all, the same kind of advancement has led to a decrease in physical activity, which can cause a host of health issues. As a society we must be mindful of the negative aspects of using computers on a daily basis.

I hope my words can awaken a sense of caution within the minds of readers, and urge them to consider the implications of computer technology before relying on it completely.

Yours sincerely,
