I was once stuck in a massive traffic jam on my way home from work. I was already running late and it looked like I wasn't going to make it home on time. My frustration was building, but I reminded myself to stay patient. Taking a few deep breaths, I turned up the music in the car, rolled down the windows and began to relax.

I watched as the cars ahead of me slowly moved along and realized that there's nothing I can do to speed up the process. I accepted the situation and turned my attention to the beautiful sunset seen through the trees. The sun's warm oranges and purples painted the sky in the most lovely way and I couldn't help but feel relaxed.

I eventually reached my destination, a full hour later than expected. Instead of feeling angry, I felt grateful that I had chosen to stay patient throughout the experience. It reminded me that no matter how difficult the situation may be, it's always important to keep an open and peaceful mindset.
