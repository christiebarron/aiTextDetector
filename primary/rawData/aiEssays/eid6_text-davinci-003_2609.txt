The builders of the Empire State Building faced an array of obstacles when attempting to make it the first ever building to allow dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Building was first built in 1931 in the heart of Manhattan, New York City and its iconic shape lent itself to the idea of being used as a docking mast for passenger and freight dirigibles. The concept of a mooring mast was a relatively new idea in the 1930s and carried a variety of engineering and safety risks that had not previously been tested. 

The first challenge in preparing the structure of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles was to ensure it was tall enough to be visible above the skyscrapers in the area which meant it had to be built higher than originally planned. This posed structural engineering problems to ensure it would be structurally sound and the wind forces it would be previously exposed to would not cause it to collapse. 

The next obstacle was to design the mooring mast, which would allow the dirigibles to dock in a stable manner. The mast had to be strong enough to support the weight of a full-size blimp, yet also light enough to not encumber the dirigibles' height or range. It was also important for the mast to be flexible, as the direction of the wind would constantly change during docking. The mast was eventually designed with a counterweight and rotation arm system that could be easily maneuvered from the ground. 

The builders also had to take into account safety concerns of passengers disembarking, as the pilots of the dirigibles had to bring the passenger compartments
