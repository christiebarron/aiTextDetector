I was feeling really lonely and depressed last week, but then I ran into an old friend at the grocery store. I hadn't seen them in years, but I recognized them instantly. We said our hellos and caught up with each other's lives. We hadn't seen each other in years and I thought it would get awkward, but instead we just started laughing together! We talked about all the silly things we had done together growing up and it was like we were back in middle school again, telling each other our stories. 

We went around the store and bought what we needed. And throughout our time together, we couldn't stop laughing. I hadn't laughed like that in forever, and it just felt so good to be happy and carefree with an old friend. We said goodbye and promised to meet up for lunch soon, and I was feeling reenergized, like I had been uplifted from all the stress I was carrying. 

It was really amazing how laughter could break down all the barriers and open up that connection between us. And it was a reminder of how powerful laughter really is in any relationship.
