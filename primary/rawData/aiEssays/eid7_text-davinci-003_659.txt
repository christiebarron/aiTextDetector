I recently had an experience with a friend in which I had to be particularly patient. We were both trying to get our degrees and in a very competitive program. We were both taking the same course and it made it very easy to compare ourselves to one another. It was easy to feel a bit of envy towards each other and this feeling was especially strong for my friend.

One day after class, my friend asked for help with a particularly hard project. I saw this as an opportunity to show my friend that I was willing to help without trying to compete. I offered to help her go through the project one step at a time and patiently answered her questions.

After a few hours of helping, she thanked me and said she had enough. I was relieved that she seemed to be feeling better about the project. Later, she showed me the project she made and I was impressed. It was clear that she had put a lot of effort into it.

My patience had paid off. That experience taught me a valuable lesson about being patient and caring for those around me instead of competing. I still take this lesson with me today, and I try to remember that sometimes being patient and offering help is more important than competing.
