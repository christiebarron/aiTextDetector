When I was in middle school, we had to take a field trip to the zoo. At the beginning of the day, the museum seemed cool and exciting. But not long after we arrived, it started to pour. We were stuck in a refrigerated rain forest, feeling wet and cold.

I was expecting a miserable end to the day, but to my surprise, everyone stayed surprisingly patient and cheerful. Despite the rain and the cold, everyone was upbeat and cooperative. We even made up a game to keep ourselves entertained as we waited for the rain to stop. 

When the rain did finally stop and we were able to see the rest of zoo, I was so surprised and grateful. We could have easily gotten angry, frustrated, and impatient with each other, but instead, everyone stayed positive and made the best of the situation. 

It was a great reminder of how important it is to stay patient in challenging situations.
