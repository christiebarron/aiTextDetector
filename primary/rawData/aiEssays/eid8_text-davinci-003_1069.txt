It was our first date and I had no idea what was going to happen. I was so nervous that it felt like a tornado was going through my stomach. We decided to go to the local park for a picnic and the sun was just starting to set as we got there.

I had already forgotten my nervousness and was enjoying the view and the peace of the park. Suddenly, something caught my eye. I noticed a dog playing fetch with its owners, springing left and right like a puppet on a string. Without thinking I burst out laughing, the kind of laugh that you can’t control.

To my surprise, my date also started to laugh and before I knew it we were both rolling on the grass in tears of laughter. We laughed until our stomachs hurt and we had to stop just to catch our breath.

That moment was so special to me and since then we’ve shared countless moments of laughter. We’ve been together for years now, holding hands and making each other laugh. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
