I recently had a situation where I needed to be patient. I was out shopping, and was in line to check out at the store. As I was waiting, I noticed that the customer ahead of me was having trouble using their credit card. The clerk was trying to help them, but the customer was getting frustrated and was about ready to give up. 

I could tell that the customer was about to walk away because they were so frustrated. Instead of talking to them, I decided to take a step back and be patient. By standing back, the customer was able to receive the help they needed from the clerk and was eventually able to check out. 

It was a relief to see that my patience had allowed the situation to be resolved. I walked away feeling proud of myself for having the patience to withhold from getting involved and for allowing the customer to be able to check out.
