I was shopping for groceries, and had a full cart. Not wanting to deal with the long line at the register, I chose the self-checkout line. Unfortunately, something was wrong with the machine I had chosen; it was taking a long time for it to process the items I was scanning.

I could feel my patience starting to wear thin. People were starting to get annoyed behind me as the line grew longer. I could hear them grumbling, but I tried to ignore them and kept on scanning my groceries. After several minutes, the machine finally kicked back in and the items started to register correctly.

Once my items had all been scanned, I was relieved to see that I could finally leave the long line behind me. Even though the situation was frustrating and I wanted to give up, I held onto my patience and persisted until the issue was resolved.
