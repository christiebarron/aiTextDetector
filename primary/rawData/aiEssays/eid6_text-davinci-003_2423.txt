The builders of the Empire State Building faced some daunting challenges when they decided to allow dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the building. Constructed in 1931, the Empire State Building in New York City was the world’s tallest building, standing at 102 stories. While the building’s designers had not originally envisioned a mooring mast to accommodate dirigibles, a 115-foot-high mooring mast was subsequently added in order to provide a safe docking area for the zeppelins.

The primary obstacle builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the lack of suitable technology to support and secure the airships to the building’s roof. To solve this problem, engineers and designers worked together to create the ‘basket-like’ mooring mast. The mooring mast was specially designed with a large horizontal ‘hoop’ to help steady the airships and keep them secure as they hovered in place.

Further challenges included developing a secure system to lower the dirigibles. Engineers had to find a way to make sure the airship would not move when it was being lowered. To address this issue, a mooring chain was attached to the airship, connecting it to an anchor beneath the roof of the Empire State Building. This allowed the chain to drop slowly and safely, providing the omni-directional stability required to prevent the airship from drifting away due to the force of the wind. 

The mooring mast proved to be a suitable solution, as it was
