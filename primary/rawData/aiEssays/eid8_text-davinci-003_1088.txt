I'll never forget the moment that my best friend and I had when we were in the sixth grade. We had just finished watching a funny movie during lunch and were talking about some of the jokes that we'd heard when I had accidentally spilled my lunch all over my shirt and the table. 

My friend started laughing so hard that I couldn't help but join in. Everyone around us started laughing, too. It was one of those moments that seemed to last an eternity, but it was so perfect and pure. 

We ended up laughing until we cried, and nobody even mentioned the mess I made. We just laughed and laughed and laughed. 

That moment was the moment that I truly connected with my friend and realized how important laughter was to bringing two people closer together. That moment has stayed with me all these years, and I know that it will stay with me for the rest of my life.
