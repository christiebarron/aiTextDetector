Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is an engaging and deeply heartfelt exploration of the complex and diverse array of emotions experienced by the author both within and beyond his Cuban-American identity. Through his intimate stories of family, home, and love, Rodriguez creates a unique mood of nostalgia and melancholia.

Rodriguez's opening words, “Where I come from is so much bigger than where I am,” immediately set a reflective tone, as the reader is invited to consider the gap between the author's place of origin and current situation. The author's well-crafted anecdotes further enhance this mood of reflection and reminiscence, highlighting the beauty in the bittersweet memories of the past and the joy of newfound perspectives through the power of self-discovery. As stories of Ricardo, Armani, and other past loves are shared, a sense of intimate loss and sadness is evoked, yet balanced with an underlining optimism and hope for the future. 

The feeling of emotional complexity and nostalgia further crescendos in the chapter, 'From Pride to Protest,' as Rodriguez thoughtfully ties his personal experiences of the 'Coming Out' journey to the more universal identity crises of those of mixed cultural backgrounds. After struggle and vulnerability, acceptance and growth are found and the mood shifts to one of courage, celebration and ultimately pride. 

Through the raw and genuine emotion experienced in From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Rodriguez eloquently captures the cyclical nature of life and the power of resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity.
