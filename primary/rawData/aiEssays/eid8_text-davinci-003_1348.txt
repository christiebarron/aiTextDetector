Laughter is one of the greatest gifts in life. It's a sign of connection, a shared moment enjoyed between two people and I am guessing that it's a universal truth. One of my favorite memories that bring a smile to my face involves a time when I was with some of my closest friends. 

We were all gathered back in college, sitting around a table in our tiny apartment, laughing and joking about various topics. Suddenly, one of my friends started to tickle another one, who then turned to me and said, "It's on!" I responded with a wink, happily joining in on the fun.

Soon, all six of us were on the floor, in a continuous fit of laughter, completely unable to stop or control ourselves. As you probably guessed, tears were beginning to roll down our faces and our stomachs were aching - and it was all because of the joy of us being together.

We were connecting on a level that I can't even explain. We were goofing off, yet still understanding and appreciating the importance of our friendship. We were letting go of all of our worries, even if it was just an impermanent escape from reality.

At that moment, I felt a call with all of my friends, something beyond language, something that was probably best expressed with that laughter. That moment was one of the most precious memories that I have, and it serves as a lovely reminder of how laughter can bring us closer together.
