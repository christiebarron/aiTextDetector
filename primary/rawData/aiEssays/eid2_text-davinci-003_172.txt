While there are compelling arguments to be made in favor of keeping materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines free from censorship, the reality is that certain items should be kept off the shelves in order to protect vulnerable viewers or those who may find the material offensive or alarming. 

Librarians have a responsibility to ensure that their patrons’ safety and well-being is of upmost priority. Though libraries are meant to be places of knowledge, inclusion and open dialogue, insensitive materials can have an exclusionary or negative impact on certain members of the community. By removing books, movies and music found to be offensive, librarians can ensure that their patrons maintain a healthy and safe environment.

In today’s age of information, libraries can be a powerful forum of free expression while still maintaining a level of safety and respect.

Librarians should be allowed to make the decision
