I had been dating my now-boyfriend for a little while when we ventured out to the local movie theater to see the newest rom-com. We were both bubbling over with excitement. We found our seats in the darkened theater, and soon enough the lights began to dim and the movie started. The movie was hilarious, and pretty soon we were both doubled over with laughter at all the hilarious antics on the screen. 

However, the laughter really ramped up to a whole new level when I felt him sneakily tickle my side. I let out a loud squeal and a roar of laughter that echoed through the theater. Everyone around us began to laugh at the two of us acting like giddy kids. The laughter we shared made me realize just how special our relationship was. I had found someone who could make me laugh so easily and freely. That night went down as one of my favorite date nights because of how infectious the laughter was. It brought us even closer than we already were; ever since then, we continue to look for ways to make each other laugh.
