The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” is poignant and meaningful. By depicting the winter hibiscus, which is unable to bloom like its warmer-weather counterparts, the narrator is hinting at her own struggles that are parallel to the plant’s inability to bloom. Her use of figurative language when describing the hibiscus’ state represents her inner turmoil that she’s facing in trying times. Notably, the first stanza suggests a season of sorrow and lassitude without the possibility of escape. 

The imagery of the winter hibiscus, which signifies the narrator’s deep introspective thoughts, is continued in the final lines of the poem. Here, her use of imagery showcases how the hope of a brighter tomorrow is only present in the nearby spring. The promise of greener pastures ahead is only possible when harsh winter passes. By comparing her struggles to the winter hibiscus, the narrator is longing for the feeling of rejuvenation that only comes when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is in full bloom. 

The narrator is drawing from the meaningful symbolism of the hibiscus and her own life experiences in this poem. The passage can be interpreted to mean that the narrator is hoping to gain the courage to face her struggles and attempt, yet again, to take that test. Through this allusion, the narrator is providing readers with an understanding of the importance of perseverance even during the toughest of times.
