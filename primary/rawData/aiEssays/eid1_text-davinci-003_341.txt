Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects that computers have on people. There is no doubt that computers have made our lives easier in many ways. However, I believe that the widespread use of computers can also have some negative results. 

To begin with, while computers can help us to do our work more quickly and efficiently, they can also lead to decreased physical activity. For this reason, many people aren’t getting the exercise they need to be physically healthy. Additionally, using computers to find information or complete tasks can lead to a decrease in problem-solving and critical thinking skills, as people don’t have to think about or remember the details the same way they would without the internet.

Furthermore, computer use can also lead to an increase in stress and a decrease in mental health. The amount of time people spend on computers, trying to stay informed and on top of their work, can lead to feelings of overwhelm and anxiety. Additionally, many people find themselves comparing their accomplishments or life to those they see on the internet, and this can lead to feelings of disappointment and depression.

In conclusion, while computers can be beneficial in many ways, they also have some major risks. It is important to find ways to balance the use of computers with more physical activities, more creative problem solving, and healthier ways of coping with mental health.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
