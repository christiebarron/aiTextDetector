I recently had to go to the DMV to renew my driver's license. When I arrived, the line was out the door and I was concerned I was going to be there for hours. But I knew I had to be patient and wait. So I got in line with my paperwork and waited. 

The wait was frustrating - it seemed like each person was taking forever. I stuck to my guns, though, and didn't get too impatient. I took deep breathes and reminded myself of the importance of being patient. 

Finally, after about an hour and a half, I made it to the front of the line. Even though the process was slow and tedious, the woman checking my paperwork was kind and understanding. She even apologized and thanked me for my patience.

In the end, I was able to get my license renewed, and I was thankful I took the time and made the effort to be patient. It made the process much less stressful, and I was glad I chose to be understanding, even when the wait was long.
