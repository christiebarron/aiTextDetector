I could still remember the sound of his laughter - loud and full of life, like a deep well spilling over the brim of joy. It had been a long week and I was in no mood for funnies, but when I stepped through the door and saw him smiling, I almost immediately found myself joining in with him. 

We were just two oddballs, both too full of life to be contained like that, and so our laughter soon had us rolling on the floor and tears streaming down our faces. I knew that no matter what happened in that moment or what lay ahead in our futures, we had shared something special; something that no one else could understand.

A couple of hours later, after the laughter had subsided and we'd managed to catch a breath, he looked at me and said, “I’m so glad I met you. This laughter is what life is all about.” 

I couldn’t have said it better myself and it made me realise that no matter what happened in the strange and confusing world around us, we had always got each other and laughter to bridge any differences between us. 

It’s a friendship I cherish to this day.
