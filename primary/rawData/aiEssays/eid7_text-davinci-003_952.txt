I recently saw an example of someone being very patient in a restaurant. Overall, the experience was not a good one. We waited 45 minutes before the food arrived and when it did, it was cold and some of it was missing. Even though the staff was not aware of the mistake, my friend did not complain. Instead he kept his cool, acknowledged their apology and said he was okay with waiting for the new order. 

I was so impressed with his behavior. He didn't get angry or demand something from the staff. He wasn't trying to embarrass them, he simply chose to be understanding. His patience was inspiring and showed a lot of respect for the staff.
