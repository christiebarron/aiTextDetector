When my best friend and I first met in college, we had absolutely nothing in common. We both came from completely different backgrounds and had disparate interests, but despite our differences, we ended up becoming good friends.

One day, in the middle of our freshman year, we had planned to take a walk around campus. As we were walking, we started to poke fun at each other for our differences in taste. We began to get a bit more serious and I remember making some joke that she didn’t take too kindly to, but then without warning she started to laugh. It became contagious and soon we were both laughing so hard that I nearly forgot the reason why we started.

Laughter can bond people and bring them closer in ways they never thought was possible. It was that moment when I realized that my friend and I weren’t so different after all. Through our laughter we had forged an unbreakable bond and have been best friends ever since.
