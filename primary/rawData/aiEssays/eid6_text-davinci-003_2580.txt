The Empire State Building was an impressive feat of architecture and innovation when it was completed in 1931. As part of its appeal, the building also had a unique feature: the ability for dirigibles, or rigid airships, to dock at the extreme top of the building. Building a structure like this posed a great number of technical and logistical obstacles for the builders and engineers.

The primary challenge the builders faced was adhering to the strict regulations set forth by the Federal Regulations of Civil Aviation. These regulations provided strict requirements for the structural integrity of the mooring mast. The mast needed to be able to hold the full weight of the dirigible, compensate for high winds on the top floors of the building, and protect against any sparks emitted by the dirigible which may cause a fire. 

Additionally, the builders had to maneuver engineering the dirigibleâ€™s mooring tether, which would secure the airship to the mast. The tethers needed to be designed with a high level of strength, weight and durability. Furthermore, a special mooring station had to be created to facilitate easy loading and unloading of passengers from the dirigible. This station had to comply with extremely complex architectural specifications, as well.

Some other challenges the builders faced included finding a way to keep the dirigible in a stable position throughout docking and departure procedures, as well as providing a secure source of fuel for the airship. The builders also had to consider ways to minimize the amount of noise the dirigible would create when docking or departing, as well as creating an efficient exit plan in case of emergencies.
