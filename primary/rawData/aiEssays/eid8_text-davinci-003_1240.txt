I had been dating my girlfriend for about two months and I wanted to do something unique for our first Valentine's Day together. I decided to surprise her with a movie night. After I had everything set up at my place with all the snacks and blankets ready, I heard her knock on the door. I opened it and she had an amused look on her face as she looked around.

"What's all this?" she asked me.

I playfully shrugged and replied, "Just your typical, run-of-the-mill movie night. Nothing special."

She started laughing, and I couldn't help but join her. We both knew I had put all this effort into making the evening special, and it felt so good to be laughing together. 

We picked out a movie and I put on some music, and we set to watching our movie. However, as soon as the movie started, we found ourselves completely unable to focus on it. Every time something funny happened in the movie, we would both start laughing uncontrollably. It felt incredible to just be able to be ourselves around each other and laugh like that. 

We spent the entire movie night laughing together, making jokes and talking about random things. 

It was one of the best nights of my life, and I will never forget how connected we felt just from sharing a simple laugh.
