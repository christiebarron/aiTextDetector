To the editor,

It is no secret that computers have had a profound impact on our lives and our society, and this should not be taken lightly. Computers have allowed us to do more in less time, expand our business reach, and create incredible art, and I firmly believe these advances are something to be celebrated.

However, there is an often overlooked and concerning downside that must be taken into account. Computers have enabled us to become increasingly disconnected from our surroundings and from each other. As communication has shifted from face to face, our ability to interact without screens has suffered.

It may feel as if our lives are undeniably intertwined with technology, but there are still tangible steps we can take to address this problem. We can limit our screen time, spend consistent time with others, and seek out outlets that foster meaningful, offline connections. We can also lead by example; strive to carve out a small space apart from the internet, and encourage our friends, family, and peers to do the same.

The effects of computers on our lives, both those that are beneficial and those that are concerning, should not be taken lightly. We should work together to ensure that technology is used for good and that we are all benefiting from it.

Sincerely,

[Name]
