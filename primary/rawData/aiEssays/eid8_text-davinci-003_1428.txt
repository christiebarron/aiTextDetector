Growing up, I lived in a large, old house with my grandmother. We had one old TV that we used to watch shows together, laugh at the funny parts, and shout out ideas to improve the plot.

Though I was only eight years old, I felt like we were best friends. We had a special bond that centered around laughing. It didn't matter if it was a genuine scooter motor malfunction in a sitcom or the random philosophical discussions we had, we would always end up laughing until the tears ran down our cheeks.

One particular day, we turned on an old western show and something funny happened. A train slowly rolled backwards and collided with a ranch house. Grandma and I looked at each other and burst into laughter. Her laugh was so infectious that I couldn't help but join in. 

We laughed so hard that we were doubled over, and I even had to clutch my stomach. When we had all calmed down and the show was almost done, we just looked at each other, smiled, and started all over again. 

It was moments like these—the ones spent laughing until we could barely breathe—that I'll always cherish. Laughter brought us together and it was a reminder that Grandma and I were always connected, no matter what.
