I was on a long-distance train ride, crammed in between two other people and carrying a huge suitcase that was taking up almost an entire seat. I'd been on the train for hours - it felt like it was never going to end - when the conductor announced that there had been a delay due to an accident up ahead. 

I groaned inwardly. I'd been hoping to arrive at my destination with enough time to settle in before my event started. Now, it looked like I'd be cutting it close.

But despite the challenging circumstances, I tried to stay patient and calm. I reminded myself that it wasn't the conductor's fault, or anyone else's for that matter, and so there was no point in getting angry. Instead, I just took out my book, put in my earphones, and allowed myself to be taken away, while I waited.

The delay ended up lasting a couple more hours; but eventually, the train was back on its way. I arrived at my destination with just enough time to change, grab a taxi and make it to the event.

In the end, I was glad I kept my cool and stayed patient throughout the delay - it made the situation so much easier and more bearable.
