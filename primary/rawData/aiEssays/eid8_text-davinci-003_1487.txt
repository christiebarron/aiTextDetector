I had been dating my boyfriend for several months and I felt like things weren't going well. We didn't spend much time together, and there was a lack of communication. One night, we decided to go care out dinner by the beach. We had a nice dinner and watched the sunset together, but the conversation still felt strained.

Out of nowhere, he says the silliest joke he had ever heard and I started to laugh uncontrollably. We were both in stitches, and I wasn't sure how long we laughed for, but it felt like forever.

After a few moments, he grabbed my hand, his thumb stroking my skin, and said, "I want this to work. I want us to make it."

He had said what I'd been wanting to hear for a long time. I looked up at him, laughing and crying at the same time, and said, "Me too."

From then on, things started to look up for us. We were still the same people, but something had changed between us. We had reconnected, and our laughter was the bridge that brought us together.
