In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist's journey. 

The cyclist embarks on an ambitious ride on an old country road in the early hours of the morning. The road is a challenging one and poses a number of obstacles that the cyclist needs to overcome. Firstly, the road is narrow and winding, which makes it difficult to navigate. The surface of the road is uneven, full of holes, bumps, and gravel which make it hard to keep a steady pace. In addition to this, the cyclist encounters a range of weather conditions including strong winds and torrential rain. This can cause problems for the cyclist, as the wind can push them off course and the rain can cause them to skid and slip. 

The lack of light from the sky also presents a problem for the cyclist. Having to ride with streetlights only, the cyclist is unable to see the obstacles ahead and must rely solely on the little light available. This makes it difficult for the cyclist to maneuver the turns in the road.
