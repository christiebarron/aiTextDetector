 

I'm a naturally serious person, but even I can't resist the magnetic pull of a good laugh - especially when it comes to sharing moments with the people I love. Recently, my best friend and I had one of those laugh-till-you-cry-out-loud moments. During a late-night FaceTime call, my best friend and I caught up on everything that had been happening since the last time we had seen each other. 

We talked about everything - from the drama at school, to a new movie we wanted to see, to a hilarious video one of her friends had sent her. We spent a good while discussing the video, debating which parts were funniest and why, and pointing out the best parts to each other. By the time we were done, we were both howling with laughter. 

We laughed until our cheeks ached, our stomachs were sore, and there were tears running down both of our faces. I can't think of a moment that made me feel closer to her than that one. It was like nothing else mattered - all the laughter was proof of our close bond. 

Laughter is a powerful thing. Not only is it good for the soul and the body, but it can also bring people closer together. That's why I cherish moments like this with my best friend - because in those moments of joy, there's nothing else that matters except the shared laughter.
