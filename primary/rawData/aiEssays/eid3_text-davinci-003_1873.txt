The setting of Joe Kurmaski's short story 'Rough Road Ahead' has a significant influence on the cyclist. The cyclist is described as being out for a leisurely ride along the Sardine River in Maine. The River is tranquil and lined with a canopy of trees whose leaves are just beginning to change colors. The cyclist appreciates the peacefulness of the setting and uses it to relax and find solace.

The tranquil setting has an immediate impact on the cyclist. Her newfound peacefulness is certainly unexpected and is a welcomed feeling. The peacefulness of the setting helps the cyclist to forget her worries and to enjoy being outdoors. The changing leaves of the trees also lend a sense of beauty to the scene, giving the cyclist a brief respite from the worries of life.

The setting of the story also affects the route the cyclist takes. The river is described as having "gently undulating paths" that meander through the woods, which gives the cyclist an opportunity to explore and enjoy the scenery. She can easily get off the beaten path and explore a different place every day, which adds to the enjoyment of her ride.

In addition, the setting of the story affects the cyclist through its physicality.
