Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. As technology advances at a rapid rate, the increasing ubiquity of computers has drastically changed the way people live and how they interact with each other. 

The ability to instantly access vast amounts of information and data with just the tap of a finger has provided people with a gateway to a world of millions of possibilities. With the help of computers, people are able to stay connected with each other across vast distances and communicate with people in ways that would be impossible just two decades ago. Computers have also made it easier to stay organized and efficient by providing helpful applications, software, and programs that optimize the userâ€™s workflows.

On the flip side, too much reliance on computers has caused people to be socially disconnected and less efficient in their day-to-day activities. People who rely too much on computers may find themselves struggling to do simple everyday tasks without a computer to help them and unable to interact with people without leaning on a computer or a phone. 

I believe that computers should be seen as a tool to help people, not as a substitute for human connection and problem solving. People should continue to use computers to their advantage, but they should not let themselves become overly reliant on them. 

I would suggest that people set aside some time to practice their problem-solving capabilities and socializing skills without the help of computers. This will
