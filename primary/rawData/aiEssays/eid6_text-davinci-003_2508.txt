The Empire State Building is an iconic structure in the United States and around the world, and its architects faced a unique challenge when developing it, allowing dirigibles to dock. During 1929-1931, the original plans for the building allowed for a mooring mast to be built, so that passengers could be transported in and out of the city via dirigible with ease. However, this plan was not an easy feat to achieve, and the construction of the Empire State Building’s mooring mast presented a number of obstacles.

The primary obstacle was the sheer engineering challenge of constructing a mooring mast high enough to be structurally safe, yet low enough on the building that the dirigibles could dock safely. This issue had to be addressed in the development of the mast itself, as well as the internal elevator systems, which needed to be able to reach, and vertically level with, the mast’s anchoring platform. 

The materials used in the construction of the mooring mast were also of major concern. The mast had to be made of steel, as this would be able to bear the strain that a full-sized dirigible would require. However, in order to allow a dirigible to pass through the Empire State Building, the mast had to be built much higher than the building itself, which meant it had to be constructed of lightweight, yet highly durable materials to make transporting the mast to the site easier, and to reduce the overall cost of the project.

The weather was also a major concern for the builders of the mooring mast. Wind and lightning
