I remember it like it was yesterday. I had gone to a dinner party with some friends and, as usual, I was a bit anxious about meeting all these new people. I had met most of the guests before but I was still a bit nervous and my hands were shaking slightly as I walked up to the door with my friends.

When we entered, I was welcomed warmly by the host and everyone else present. After a few minutes, we settled down and all the conversations flowed easily. Suddenly, someone said something so ridiculous that we all burst out laughing. It seemed that everyone could relate to the joke even though we were from different backgrounds.

The laughter felt like a healing force. It broke down barriers and we all started to share funny stories and experiences. I felt more relaxed and at ease, and all of a sudden, the nervousness I had felt before the dinner party had completely evaporated.

I left the dinner party feeling empowered and connected to everyone there in a way I never had before. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and that dinner party is a reminder of how much closer a group of strangers can get through laughter.
