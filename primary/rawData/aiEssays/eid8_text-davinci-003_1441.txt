I'll never forget the way my granddad used to make me laugh. He could always make me smile when I was feeling down, and it was through laughter that we bonded. He had an infectious, belly-rumbling chuckle that was so contagious it was impossible not to join in. 

One particular moment I remember fondly was during a family gathering. We were all sitting around the table discussing the day's events, but the conversation had fizzled out. As usual, Granddad was the one to save the day. Looking around the table, he suddenly announced in his most serious voice: "I've just seen something you won't believe!" We all eagerly waited for him to explain. "I've just seen a chicken in the bathroom!" 

The room erupted into riotous laughter, and for the next few minutes we all tried to catch our breath between fits of endless giggles. Granddad kept us entertained for the rest of the evening, each time following up his joke with louder and louder laughter. Even when the jokes stopped, his laughter still rang through the room, and it was his contagious laughter that made that evening so wonderful. 

Granddad may no longer be around to tell his goofy jokes, but his laughter still lives on in my heart. I'm so grateful that I got to share in all those moments of joy, and that they remain some of my most treasured memories.
