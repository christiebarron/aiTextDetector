Once, when I was in a crowded store, I was waiting in the checkout line with only a few items to purchase. Everyone seemed to be in a rush, but I was patient and waited my turn. I noticed a woman with a full cart and items falling out the sides who had gotten ahead of me in the line. I resisted the urge to complain and instead offered to help her bag her items. She smiled and thanked me for my kindness, and the cashier thanked me too for being so patient with the situation. I was glad I could be helpful and patient and the experience reminded me that small acts of kindness can make all the difference.
