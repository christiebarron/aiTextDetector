The ending to Minfong Ho's â€˜Winter Hibiscus' is symbolic and full of hope. Through a young student's struggle to pass a test and their longing for Spring and the test retake come a lesson in resilience and determination. 

The student planting the hibiscus in the winter is representative of the hope they have in their own success, despite the harshness of the season. It reveals the importance they place in their education and the optimistic attitude they have towards the future. It portrays a strong desire to prove themselves and indicates that success may be just around the corner. 

The use of the geese is delicately woven into the idea of longing. The geese are a seasonal sign of hope and new beginnings and their migration serves as a metaphor for hope in the future - for the student to be able to take the test again when the snows melt and the geese return. The strength of the student's trust in themselves and in the natural cycle of change can be felt in their declaration at the end of the piece. 

The student's hope to be able to take the test again and the optimism present in the story can give readers a fresh perspective on life when faced with adversity. It serves as a gentle reminder to stay encouraged, even when things are tough, and to keep pushing forward in pursuit of our goals. The student's courage, character, and resilience presented in 'Winter Hibiscus' can inspire us all to trust in the process and have faith that better days are ahead.
