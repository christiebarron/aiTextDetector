I was at the grocery store and the person in front of me in line had a lot of items and was having trouble counting out the right amount of cash. I waited patiently as they fumbled through their wallet, trying to make sure they had enough. Finally, after about five minutes, they had the right amount and handed it to the cashier. 

I was grateful that I had been patient, as I was in a bit of a rush and I had been considering leaving the line and trying again later. But I was happy that I had waited and given the person in front of me the time they needed.
