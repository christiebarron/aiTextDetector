It was a hot and sultry summer day, and I had been invited to a barbecue at my friend's house. I don't usually feel at ease in social situations, but when I arrived, I was met with a warm and friendly atmosphere, and I was soon at ease. 

My friends, a mixed group of all ages, were telling stories and laughing, and to my surprise, I found myself joining in. The company was great, and I was soon in fits of laughter, which seemed to catch on like wildfire. 

As we were all still mingling, a story came up about one of my good friends. While he was away at university, he had done something particularly foolish, but it was hilarious! I couldn't help but join in the laughter. 

The laughter lot of us were making was infectious, so much so that even the people who weren't part of the conversation were drawn in. Before I knew it, the whole group of us was in uproar, and the atmosphere was electric. 

That afternoon created a deep bond between all of us. The laughter shared was a powerful form of connection. To me, it was worth more than anything else. 

It may have been a relatively small moment, but it proved to me that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
