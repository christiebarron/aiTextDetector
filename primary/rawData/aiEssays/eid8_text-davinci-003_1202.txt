My friend and I had just finished a stressful day of studying when we decided to take a break. We went to a cafe down the road, and while we were ordering, we got into a bit of a silly debate about something trivial. It started off as just a few playful jabs here and there, and before we knew it, we were both cracking up with laughter. 

The waiter, who had heard us laughing, looked over at us and smiled. We both tried to stifle our laughter, but it was no use. I looked over at my friend and we were both just laughing too hard to stop. 

Finally, the waiter couldnâ€™t contain his own laughter and he started laughing with us. We all just stood there, laughing and enjoying the moment. No one said anything, but we all felt a bit closer to each other in that moment. 

We left the cafe with a smile on our faces and in our hearts, feeling more connected to each other than ever before. That day, I realized that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
