Dear Editor,

It's amazing to think of the incredible effect computers have had on the way we live. While this technology certainly has its advantages, it also has quite a few concerning effects on people's lives. 

For starters, time spent with technology can severely limit interactions between family and friends. It's because computers take away the time we should have spent being with our loved ones. In addition, too much time devoted to computers can often lead to sleep deprivation, which can have a negative impact on cognitive functioning, such as our thoughts and feelings. 

Moreover, computers can also be a real distraction from studying, work, and other important activities. Since computers make it so easy to access a wide range of entertainment and social media, it's quite easy for valuable time to be wasted. 

I think it's obvious to anyone that computers have a lasting effect on our lives and health. We should be aware of how computers are changing us and try to avoid some of the consequences of overusing them. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my thoughts.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
