I remember one occasion when I had to be particularly patient. I needed a new washing machine, as the one I had was fairly old. I really wanted to purchase a new one as soon as I could, but I had a limited budget so I knew I would need to do some comparison shopping.

Since stores weren't open due to the pandemic, I had to do all of my research online. I scoured websites and reviews and compiled a list of potential washing machines that looked good and were in my budget. 

Afterwards, I started to call each store to discuss pricing and ask questions about the machines. This was very time-consuming, and sometimes it seemed like it would never end. In the end, it was a store manager who had been exceptionally patient, not just with me but with every customer.

He had to explain the same thing multiple times, since not all customers had the same understanding. He was also kind and helpful, and actually recommended some brands that were not on my list in order to make sure I got the best deal.

In the end, his patience and kindness paid off, as I eventually settled on a washing machine from one of his stores. It was the perfect purchase and I am still really grateful to the man for his help and patience.
