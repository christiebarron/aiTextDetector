I remember the first time I really laughed with my now-partner. We'd only known each other for a few weeks when we decided to go out to the movies together. I was a little nervous, having only just started getting to know each other, but it was exciting.

The movie we went to see was a comedy, and I was expecting it to be enjoyable, but I wasn't expecting the belly laughs we shared. I had tears in my eyes and my face was sore as I laughed so hard. We found ourselves in lockstep as our laughter echoed in the theater. 

The moment sticks with me due to how joyous it felt to be so free with someone I didn't know very well but had already begun to build a connection with. From that day, I knew we had a special connection, and laughter played a huge part in it. 

Laughter is the closest connection two people can have and I am so grateful for all the laughter and love my partner and I now share every day.
