I remember the first time my little sister, who was five years old at the time, laughed at one of my jokes. I was about thirteen and had been trying for days to make her smile, but she wouldn't budge. So one day, out of desperation, I told her a joke I had heard from a friend. It was a silly one about a puppy who was afraid of cats.

At first, my sister didn't even crack a smile. But then I started to act out the punchline, flailing my arms around and making silly faces. That's when it happened. She started to giggle, and before long she was rolling around with laughter.

That moment made me feel so proud and happy. I had finally achieved something that I had been trying to do for days, and seeing her smile was the best feeling in the world. We've shared many more moments of laughter since then, but that first one will remain the most special.
