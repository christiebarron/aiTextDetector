I remember a time when I had to be incredibly patient. It was during a long road trip with my family. We had to drive for 8 hours and my siblings were bickering the entire time. I wanted to speak up and tell them to quiet down, but I knew that would only make the situation worse. So instead I chose to be more patient with them.

I sat in the back seat with a forced smile on my face as I let their arguing continue. I tried to make light of the situation by telling jokes, but it didn’t really help. As challenging as it was, I eventually managed to stay patient and tolerable until the trip was over. 

My siblings were both exhausted from the yelling and finally just fell asleep. I remained patient, but the silence was far more pleasant. And at the end of the trip, when we finally arrived home, everyone was in a much better mood. It was a moment where I had to test my patience, but I’m glad I chose to remain patient.
