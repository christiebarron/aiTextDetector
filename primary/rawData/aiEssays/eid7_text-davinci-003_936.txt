I recently went on a trip to Europe with my family. We had several flights scheduled and I was incredibly excited for the adventure that lay ahead of us. On one of our flights, unfortunately, our plane was delayed four hours due to a mechanical issue. At first, I was frustrated, but I reminded myself to be patient. 

My family and the other passengers had no choice but to remain in the terminal while the issue was being addressed. Though the hours seemed to drag on and my excitement was waning, I tried to stay calm. I read a book, chatted with my family, and even got to talk to other passengers waiting for the plane. 

Once the plane was fixed and we were able to board the aircraft, the airline staff came around with snacks and drinks for everyone, apologizing for the delay. I was relieved at last, and I was glad I had tried my best to be patient.
