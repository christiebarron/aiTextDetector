I was in line at the post office trying to mail a package when I noticed that the person in front of me was having difficulty with the clerk. They seemed to be having a hard time figuring out how to fill out the necessary forms on the clipboard and was growing very frustrated and was about to give up.

I didn't want to see them leave without getting the package mailed, so I spoke up and offered my help. After we managed to fill out the forms, I was surprised by how patient the clerk was throughout the process. He took the time to thoroughly answer all of our questions and was even kind enough to provide a few more forms that we had not thought to use. 

As we finished up, I thanked him and he thanked me back, noting that it was nice to see people being so patient. I thought that it was nice of him to take the time to help us out and to appreciate our patience. It made me feel good afterwards and I was glad that I had stepped in to help out.
