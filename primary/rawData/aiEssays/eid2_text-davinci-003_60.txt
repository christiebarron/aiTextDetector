Recently, there has been some public debate about whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be allowed in libraries and removed if they are found to be offensive. This debate is incredibly important because it affects what people in our communities are exposed to and how our libraries are used.

When making this decision, it is essential to consider the interests of both adults and children. Although adults should be allowed to make their own decisions about what they read, they should not be allowed to impose those decisions on other adults or children. Libraries have the responsibility to provide a safe learning and recreational environment for adults, children, and families. This obligation trumps any private or ideological interests and in turn, dictates how libraries curate their collections.

Having said that, the answer is not outright censorship. Librarians should use their professional judgement and expertise to curate collections that are sensitive to their community and the delicate balances of freedom of speech and safety. This means responsibly selecting materials that can be used in diverse and open dialogue, while also honoring the values of their communities. It also means that parents and children can feel confident that they will not be exposed to materials that go beyond the norm.

Ultimately, libraries should have the right to decide what materials they do and donâ€™t carry. By using discretion and recognizing their responsibilities, libraries have the capacity to create open learning and recreational environments that are beneficial to the entire community. Censorship should not be the answer, but instead a carefully thought out approach that respects the wants, needs, and values of the community.
