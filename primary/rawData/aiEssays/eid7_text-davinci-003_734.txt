I was volunteering in a soup kitchen one weekend and we had hit a snag in the kitchen. The pots and pans had been placed too close together and a couple of them got stuck together. We had to call in a repair person to come and help us get them apart and it seemed like it was taking forever.
I must admit, I was starting to get a bit frustrated, but then I took a breath and remembered that these things happen sometimes and that it was our job to stay patient while we waited. I kept my cool and tried to reassure the others in the kitchen that we would get it sorted out in time. After a few more minutes, the repair person eventually came, fixed the problem and before long, the kitchen was back up and running.

I'm proud of my patience that day and I'm glad that I was able to keep my composure and stay calm in the situation. It can be difficult to stay patient, but I'm glad that I did.
