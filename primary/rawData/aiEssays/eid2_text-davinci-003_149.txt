Censorship in libraries is a controversial issue that has been debated for years. Libraries are known to be places of learning where visitors can explore and discover new information. Unfortunately, some libraries have taken the stance of censorship, believing that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. While there is a need for libraries to protect an audience from any harmful material, censorship should not be the primary goal. 

Censorship in libraries ultimately leads to an environment of censorship such that readers are limited to what they are able to access and explore. It prevents readers from forming their own opinions and making their own decisions on what publications they deem appropriate or inappropriate. Additionally, it disproportionately affects minority groups by limiting their access to works that represent their beliefs and experiences. Furthermore, censorship in libraries can be seen as an attack on free speech and an attempt to limit citizensâ€™ access to information. 

When discussing censorship in libraries, it is important to consider the links between censorship and education. Without access to a variety of materials, many library visitors are not exposed to different perspectives which could expand their understanding of the world and the people around them. Thus, it is essential for libraries to provide access to a wide range of materials from which readers can form their own opinion.

Ultimately, censorship has little place in libraries and should be implemented only in extreme cases. Libraries serve as valuable outlets for freedom of thought and expression and should work to facilitate open dialogue. Rather than implementing censorship, libraries must work to empower their readers through access to a variety of publications,
