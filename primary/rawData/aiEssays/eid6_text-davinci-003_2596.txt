The building of the Empire State Building in the early 1930s posed many challenges, including the controversial decision to allow dirigibles, or large airships, to dock at the top of the building. Despite the numerous obstacles that the builders had to face in allowing such a feat, the stubborn determination of the CEO of the Empire State Building Corporation (ESBC), later to become one of the most iconic structures in the world, made it possible.

Before any planning for dirigible docking could begin, the builders of the Empire State Building had to first secure the necessary permits from the Department of Commerce, which had power over the country’s airspace. The strict regulations and long process required special consideration and paperwork with long-term implications, making it a daunting and detailed task. The builders had to explain in precise detail their plans and also convince the Department of Commerce of their safety precautions.

In additional to the legal aspects of the project, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face several other obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The most glaring was the sheer altitude at which the docking facility would be constructed – the top of the building was 1,250 feet off the ground, the highest altitude at which any dirigible had ever attempted to dock. The sturdy wind currents at that height, in combination with the enormous size of the building, meant that the builders had to ensure sufficient stability in order to ensure the safe docking of a dirigible.

The builders also had to consider the practical and operational implications of such a feat. For example, they had to design the docking mast for the dirigibles
