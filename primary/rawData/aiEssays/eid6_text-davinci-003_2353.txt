The Empire State Building was first conceived as a tall and modern building, but the addition of a mooring mast was just as revolutionary. The potential for dirigibles (or airships) to dock atop the building would have been world-changing and allowed for a new level of Travel, Trade, and Commune with the world. However, this daring vision came with an array of obstacles, making the task of building an operable mooring mast more challenging than initially imagined.

The first problem the builders of the Empire State Building encountered was the mast’s construction. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted writes in her book The Mooring Mast, “the mooring mast designed for the Empire State Building had to be the tallest ever built at the time, each vertical guy wire having to reach 350 feet above the ground”. This meant that its design had to be exceptionally sturdy, as the mast would eventually be able to bear the weight of a large airship. It also had to be tall enough for the airship to make a safe landing, meaning the difficult task of designing a mast for the building was already underway.

The second major obstacle was the weather. Being that the Empire State Building is located in New York City, the mooring mast would experience severe weather conditions, such as high winds, snow, lightning and more. This presented yet another problem: how would the mast be able to remain stable and steady while it was holding an airship under such severe conditions? In addition to weatherproofing the structure, the builders also had to be sure the mast could
