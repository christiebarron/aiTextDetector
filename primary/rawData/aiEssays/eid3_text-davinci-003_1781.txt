The setting of the cyclist’s journey in ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski has numerous features to it that greatly influence and shape the cyclist’s experiences.

The cyclist is travelling in a remote part of the continent – with only occasional towns and villages in sight. This means that the cyclist is out in the open with very few distractions, and is isolated from any kind of help and support network. This emphasizes the vulnerability of the cyclist as they pass through the dangerous terrain. The cyclist is also travelling uphill, and this is important as it affects the cyclist's physical and mental state, as the cyclist struggles to make progress during the steep climb. The challenge of this particular setting wears the cyclist down, making their journey gruelling and intense.

The setting also has a few more subtle features. Kurmaski’s descriptions of the sheer vastness of the landscape create a sense of presence and of majesty, inspiring awe in the cyclist. The harshness of the landscape, with its deep ravines and wide expanses, are also a feature that emphasizes the danger in the terrain, and provides a sense of austerity and seriousness to the cyclist’s journey.
