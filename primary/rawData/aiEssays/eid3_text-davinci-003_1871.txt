The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski is an essential factor in this story. It is the location that serves as the foundation the cyclist needs to traverse in his journey. The setting of the story is abstractly described as a “rugged mountain track” suggesting the terrain is steep and challenging. This landscape automatically imbues a level of tension and puts the cyclist on a course that will test their courage and fortitude. 

The cyclist is found in a precarious position, being lost, tired and close to giving up, meaning the terrain and difficulty of the track has only accelerated their mental struggle. There is a heightened feeling of anxiety and danger found in the atmosphere as the cyclist continues this arduous journey. This is surrounded by references to the darkness of the moon, suggesting the setting is also night which furthers the intensity of the story.

The features of this setting also affect the cyclist in subtle ways in the form of its beauty. As the cyclist continues to push through, the sunset emerges and its natural beauty brings with it a renewed strength and drive to continue the journey, allowing the cyclist to reach the peak and find a resolution to his internal struggle.
