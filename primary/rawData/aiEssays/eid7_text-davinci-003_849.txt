I was recently on my way to pick up my daughter from school, but due to heavy traffic, I was running late. As I was driving, I could feel my emotions rising and I knew it wasn't going to be easy to keep it together.

I knew that my daughter was going to be sad and frustrated that I was late and I wanted to be able to remain calm and patient with her. As I arrived, I found her crying in the corner of the playground. I wiped away her tears and tried to explain to her that there was a lot of traffic and I couldn't help it.

She began to cry more and I could feel my emotions rising again, but this time I was able to stop them from getting the better of me. I took a deep breath and chose to remain patient. Instead of getting angry or frustrated, I worked to be understanding. I told her that I was sorry and hugged her.

By the end of it, she was calmer and was more understanding that there were things out of my control. I was so proud of myself for staying patient and understanding and for being able to handle the situation in a calm way.
