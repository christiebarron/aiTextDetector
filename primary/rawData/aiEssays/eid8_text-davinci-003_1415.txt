It was the beginning of a beautiful summer day and I was at the beach with my best friend. We decided to go for a long walk along the sand and it started out with a comfortable silence that carried its own kind of comfort. After a while, we started talking about our dreams and our plans for the future, and neither one of us could hold back our enthusiasm for the exciting opportunities that lay ahead. 

As we talked, I started to become increasingly animated, telling stories and jokes as a way to express my ideas. We had been walking for almost an hour when the laughter started to build. It started as a few giggles here and there, and before we knew it, it had crescendoed into uncontrollable laughter. We were laughing at funny stuff, silly stuff, and anything else we could think of.

It was like we had suddenly broken through some invisible barrier and entered a brand new realm of joy and connectedness. We laughed until our faces hurt and our stomachs ached, but we kept at it. The sound of our laughter filled the air and blended perfectly with the sound of the waves crashing on the shore.

When the laughter finally subsided, it was replaced with a feeling of warmth and joy. That moment will always stay in my memory as a reminder of how laughter can truly bring two people together.
