The concept of docking a dirigible, or a large floating aircraft, to the Empire State Building was a novel and ambitious endeavor, but the builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles in implementing it. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, The Mooring Mast, these obstacles are explored in detail.

The primary limitation the builders faced was one of engineering. Dirigibles operate differently from airplanes, and the engineering of the mast of the Empire State Building wasn’t initially engineered to hold the 450 tons of a zeppelin. Additionally, the size and shape of the Empire State Building made it difficult to engineer a solution that would allow for the safe and secure docking of a dirigible. The mast needed to extend out several hundred feet, and its circumference had to be large enough to clasp the dockable portion of the zeppelin. 

Another obstacle was cost. Steel and other building materials were expensive during the construction of the Empire State Building, which was built during the Great Depression. Building a mooring mast would add to the expense of the project, and the budget did not initially include such a feature.

Safety and security were also issues that had to be addressed. The dirigible docking required special signals and flares to ensure the passengers outside could gauge the right height and distance to safely dock the ship. Other safety concerns included the potential for severe weather conditions, such as lightning, and the potential for dangerous materials or objects to damage the zeppelin. Pilot error was also a real concern, as the pilot of the dirigible had to have expert navigational skills.
