The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski have a major effect on the cyclist. The terrain is mountainous and hilly, which requires extra effort from the cyclist in order to ascend and descend the peaks. The cyclist has to use a heavier bike, so they are less agile and not able to achieve the same speeds they could on a lighter model.

The weather also affects the cyclist's performance — it's hot and humid, which makes the ride physically demanding on the cyclist. The cyclist has to constantly adjust their speed and strategy to accommodate the varying terrain. For example, they have to modify their gearing to keep up with the steep inclines, and they have to frequently stop to rest and hydrate.
