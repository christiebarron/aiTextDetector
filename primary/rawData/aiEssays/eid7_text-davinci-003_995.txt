I was at the supermarket, waiting in the seemingly never-ending line. As I slowly moved up the line, I could feel my patience waning and my temper rising. Everyone was impatiently trying to sneak their way up the queue and it was really beginning to aggravate me. However, just when I thought I would completely lose my temper, the elderly women in front of me extended me kindness that I didn’t expect.

She turned to me and apologized for the long wait. I was taken aback by her kindness as it seemed out of place in such an impatient environment. I returned her smile and wished her a good day; this seemed to brighten her day and she thanked me genuinely. When it was her turn to pay she began to fumble through her wallet and couldn’t find the correct change.

That’s when a wave of patience swept through me and I immediately asked the cashier if I could pay for her groceries. She was so grateful and thanked me profusely. As I was leaving the store, I felt a sense of accomplishment seeing the sincere smile on the elderly woman’s face—it was then I realized that being patient was truly worth it.
