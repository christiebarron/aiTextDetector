The Empire State Building was an engineering marvel when it opened in 1931 yet it was also the first skyscraper built with consideration to dock dirigibles. Building a mooring mast was no small feat and had its fair share of obstacles. Nevertheless, through careful planning and a commitment to quality, the Empire State Building was able to accommodate dirigibles. 

The most significant obstacle in accommodating dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the design of the mooring mast. It needed to be engineered to specification for it to be able to handle docking. The mooring mast had to be 200 feet high, with a covered area at the bottom for passengers and a 1,200-square-foot outdoor landing area. It also had to be capable of supporting the weight of re-fueling tankers. During its construction, the engineers had to take into account the potential hazard of electric sparks that could ignite the hydrogen fuel used in dirigibles and worked to minimize the risk.

To meet the requirements for a safe mooring mast, the engineers had to employ innovative construction techniques. For example, they drilled deep into the bedrock to create a strong foundation to support the mast as well as the wind pressure a dirigible would cause. The support structure was also built using a large steel tube and a system of guy wires to provide increased stability and safety. Additionally, the engineers took care to use special construction materials to insulate the mast and make it non-conductive of electricity.

The designers also tackled the challenge of landing in NYC's windy environment. To achieve this, they had to
