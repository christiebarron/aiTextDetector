I was walking through the park with my best friend, trying to make our way through the crowd to get to the other side. Suddenly, we heard a burst of laughter coming from the corner. As we got closer, we saw a group of people, all laughing together and having a great time. 

I was feeling a little overwhelmed, so I asked my friend if we could just watch and not be noticed. She was game so we stood on the sidelines and watched them. We noticed how they were all laughing together, enjoying the moment without a care in the world.

One of them noticed us and waved us over. I nervously looked over to my friend who nodded with a smile and off we went. We slowly joined the circle, not sure what we were joining. 

The next thing we knew, there was a joke being passed around, and while some were funny, others were completely silly. We laughed through all of them, until we were all exhausted and tears were streaming down our faces. 

We stayed for what seemed like hours, just laughing and enjoying each other's company. It was a nice reminder of how laughter can bring people together and produce joy, even in the most unexpected of circumstances.  It reminded me that I should never forget to take the time to enjoy a good laugh with friends every now and then.
