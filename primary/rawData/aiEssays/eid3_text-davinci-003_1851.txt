In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in a considerable way. The setting is a winding mountain road, the riders are competing in a race, and the weather is clear, dry and hot.

The winding mountain road provides a challenge to the cyclists. Despite having ridden the course multiple times, the curves, hills and sharp declines of the mountain road can leave even experienced cyclists in surprise. This factor makes the race more demanding and puts the cyclist in an extreme test of physical and mental strength as they constantly need to be aware of the road ahead. Moreover, the heat adds to the difficulty, making it hard for the cyclists to maintain a fast and steady pace.

The cyclist’s strategy is also shaped by the setting. The cyclist needs to manage her resources, namely her energy and hydration, all the way until she reaches the top. This means that she has to maintain a steady rhythm and avoid over-exerting herself. The terrain also makes it even harder to find a solid rhythm. The cyclist needs to anticipate the certain spots along the route and when to pedal harder or take it easy.
