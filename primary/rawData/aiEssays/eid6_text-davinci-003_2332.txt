The engineers of the Empire State Building faced a grand challenge when creating a space for docking of dirigibles. Even though this groundbreaking aviation feat created a public spectacle bringing massive attention to the city, it was a serious engineering feat to take on. Constructing a skyscraper docked by airships presented an array of obstacles, with different aspects needing to be taken into account to ensure the structure’s integrity and the safety of passengers. 

The greatest risk to the Empire State Building was the force of the wind, which can easily cause an airship to come in too fast and slam into the building. This presented the biggest danger to the building and its passengers, as strong winds could surprise passing dirigibles and cause them great harm. To counter this, incredible engineering innovations were made in order to secure the Empire State Building against winds. A combination of mooring cables and an enormous mast, reaching 850 feet and weighing 200 tons, were placed on the building’s roof to ensure the dirigible’s safe arrival and landing. The mast, created in an aerodynamic design, was placed at an angle to reduce the pressure of winds. Additionally, rigid mooring cables were set up to attach the mooring mast to the building, so that the ship didn’t leave its position due to any sudden gusts of wind. These cables were also strong enough to shoot out parachutes to the ground if the mast got detached from the building.

Another aspect that had to be carefully designed was the dock’s size and location. The engineers had to make sure the shape of
