To the Editor:

In today's world, computers have become an important and inescapable presence in our lives. From hand-held devices to desktops, they've become not just a tool to assist us with our daily tasks but also a reason to avoid getting out and embracing the world around us.

I am of the opinion that, in spite of their convenience, computers are having an increasingly negative effect on people. To begin with, computers can deprive users of important social interaction. People may stay indoors for hours on end, typing messages to each other instead of engaging in meaningful, face-to-face conversations.

Also, computers can be a source of mental distractions, diverting people from activities such as reading and other tasks that could help continue the growth of their cognitive skills. Moreover, looking at the screen for too long can strain the eyes.

Finally, there is the problem of becoming addicted to computers. There is a very real danger that people may become so reliant on them that it damages their ability to perform everyday tasks.

I urge readers to weigh the risks of computer use very carefully and, when possible, to limit their use. Sometimes a break from the computer can be the key to a healthier, more balanced life.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
