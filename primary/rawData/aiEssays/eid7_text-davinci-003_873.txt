I was recently on a business trip that required me to fly across the country. It was a long journey, and things didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. Not only was the plane delayed, but my layover was longer than expected as well. I was exhausted and extremely frustrated. 

However, I remembered that I could choose to be patient even in the most trying of circumstances. I took some deep breaths and reminded myself that complaining wouldn't make the wait any shorter. So instead, I calmly went about my business and waited for the plane to arrive.

Once I was on the plane, I was happy to find out that the other passengers were friendly and that the flight attendant was experienced and professional. On top of that, the plane was comfortable and I had plenty of entertainment options to keep me occupied during the flight.

I was relieved when I eventually made it to my destination, but I was also proud of myself for staying patient regardless of the inconvenience I faced on my journey. It's not easy to stay calm during frustrating situations, but it's often the option that leads to the best outcome.
