They take a long car ride and visit a botanical garden filled with plants from all over the world. It’s here that the protagonist is made aware of a rare hibiscus flower that only blooms in winter.

The protagonist is struggling in school, but looking at the resilient hibiscus that blooms in the winter gives her hope that she too can overcome her struggles. In the final line of the story, the protagonist resolves to try and do better in school and says “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?” This line is symbolic of the protagonist believing that, if she can endure and stay resilient like the hibiscus, she will be able to overcome her troubles and do better in school.

The botanist tells the protagonist that the plant came from a region which constantly experiences harsh winter conditions of snow and ice, but even in these conditions, the hibiscus flourishes and puts out beautiful flowers every winter.
