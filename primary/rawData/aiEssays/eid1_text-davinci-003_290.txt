Dear Editor,

In today's world, computers are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, from work to leisure activities. But what effects do computers have on people?

I believe computers can have a positive effect on people and our society. On the most basic level, computers make tasks easier, faster and more efficient. For example, in the workplace, employees can use computers to stay organized, communicate with colleagues, and find important information. Computers have also improved communication between people, allowing us to easily connect with each other regardless of distance, time or other differences.

Computers also offer people new opportunities for learning and leisure activities. We can quickly and easily find educational or entertaining content online. We can research, create and showcase our own knowledge, allowing us to learn new skills, explore topics of interest, or even start a business.

The impact of computers can be seen far beyond the workplace and leisure activities. Computers allow us to access health and government services, find financial assistance and other support, and even create a platform for social change. Computers greatly expand our potential for progress and growth.

In summary, I believe computers have a significant, valuable effect on people and society. They allow us to communicate, be creative and discover new opportunities for learning and progress. I encourage everyone to consider the positive potential of computers and how we can embrace and utilize them to move forward.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
