I was running late to an important meeting. As soon as I left my house, the traffic was so bad that I knew I wouldnâ€™t make it on time. I was getting angry and frustrated, but I told myself to stay patient and be understanding. I thought of some breathing exercises to help me stay calm, and eventually, I was able to complete my journey without succumbing to my rising temper. When I arrived, I was about ten minutes late, but my boss was surprisingly understanding and thanked me for my patience.
