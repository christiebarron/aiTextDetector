I recently had a situation where I was faced with having to be patient. I was at the grocery store, busy doing my weekly grocery shopping when I noticed it was starting to get busy. I was getting to the checkout line and realized I had forgotten one of the items I needed. Rather than scrambling around the store trying to find it, I decided to wait. I knew the checkout line was going to be long, so rather than getting frustrated and feeling impatient, I just waited.

To my surprise, a few minutes later an announcement was made that one of the cashiers was having technical issues and would be delayed for a few minutes. Everyone around me started to grumble and express their irritation. I simply accepted the situation and stayed calm. I used the delay to my advantage and began to organize my groceries.

As time passed and the technical issues were eventually solved, much of the grumbling had stopped. People had realized it wasn't worth getting stressed about. I was the last to be processed in the checkout line but I wasn't annoyed or agitated. Instead, I was thankful for the extra time I had been given to finish picking up my groceries before leaving. 

Being patient is often difficult, but in this particular situation I'm proud of the way I stayed calm and accepted the extra wait time. It made my grocery trip go by much more smoothly!
