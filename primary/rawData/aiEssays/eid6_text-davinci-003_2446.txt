The Empire State Building was originally conceived to feature an observation tower, dirigible mooring mast, and terminal building. While the observation tower and terminal building were successfully completed, the challenge of building the dirigible mooring mast at the top of the structure was not, due to a number of issues.

The first obstacle was the limited space available at the top of the Empire State Building. At the time it was built, the mast had to fit in a space of only 20 by 20 feet. This small area significantly limited the types of mooring masts engineers could design, and many proposed models undermined the structural integrity of the building.

The second obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the wind currents of the surrounding area. Unlike a boat mooring mast, those designed for dirigibles had to be very tall in order to provide a better connection between the dirigible and the structure. However, due to the wind currents around the Empire State Building, any mast higher than approximately 150 feet was deemed too dangerous and would have been detrimental to the mooring process.

The third obstacle was the instability of the dirigible itself. Dirigibles of the time period were heavy gas-filled balloons, making them difficult to maneuver in the wind. This created a number of additional problems, such as how to keep the dirigibles tethered in place while they were mooring, how to dock them when the wind conditions were strong, and how to keep them from crashing into the building when the wind was blowing them away from the mooring mast.
