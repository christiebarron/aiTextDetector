I remember a time that I was visiting my mom in the hospital. We had been there for weeks, and I was so stressed out about the condition of her health. One particular day, there was a lot of test results coming in, and I was on edge trying to figure out what all these results meant. As I waited anxiously, the nurse came in and calmly explained the results to us, even taking the time to answer all of my questions. She was so patient, and it was really a relief for me to see her take her time and explain things clearly. I appreciated her kindness and patience in that moment, and am thankful to this day for her guidance.
