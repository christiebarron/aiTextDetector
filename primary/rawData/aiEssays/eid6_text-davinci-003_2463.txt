The Empire State Building was, and still is, one of the most iconic skyscrapers in the world. Although the building has become a global symbol of progress and modernity, its construction was not without its obstacles and one of the most challenging was the incorporation of facilities to allow dirigibles to dock. Despite the bold ambition to be the world’s first building with such a feature, access to the tower was unsurprisingly limited by technical, structural, and environmental issues.

The foremost difficulty was the clearance of the surrounding downtown NYC skyline. For the mooring mast to be able to support dirigibles, the mast had to be roughly 1,000 feet tall, which exceeded the restrictions imposed by local and federal aviation authorities. Another difficulty was the unique composition of the mast. At the time, no skyscraper had ever before been constructed for airship moorings and thus engineers had to find a way to construct a tower with no precedent. The structural engineering problem was further compounded by the fact that the mast had to be attached to the existing steel skeletal frame of the Empire State Building. Engineers had to find a way to secure the mast to the building without compromising the structural integrity of the whole.

Luckily, the engineers also used their ingenuity in creating solutions to the clearance and structural problems. In order to accommodate the towering mast, the lawyers behind the construction used zoning laws that allowed for taller downtown structures if the top portion was used for “public good.” Furthermore, they used a specially designed column which would act as a transition point between the existing frame and the new mooring mast.
