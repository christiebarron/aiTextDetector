I had always felt like the odd one out when I moved to a new town. I knew no one and had a hard time fitting in. One day, I had gone for a walk to my local park and I noticed that a group of people were congregated near the swing-set, all of them laughing uproariously. 

Being shy, I hesitated before joining them, even though I was intrigued by the sound of their laughter. As I came closer, I could now tell that they were discussing silly, childish stories, being immature and having a wonderful time. 

Suddenly consumed by the contagiousness of their spirits, I felt myself overcome with urge to laugh too, and before I knew it, I had started chuckling and joining in their silly stories, quickly picking up their easy rapport. Before long, I found myself completely engulfed in their laughs, discussing silly jokes and goofing off, feeling like I truly belonged to the group. 

I walked away feeling lighter and more at ease, miraculously having found my place in this new town. All because of some light-hearted laughter.
