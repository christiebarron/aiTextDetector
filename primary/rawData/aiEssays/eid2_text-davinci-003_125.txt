Censorship in libraries is a hotly contested issue, with proponents and opponents, so it is important to consider a balanced stance on the matter. Some materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines, can be deemed offensive and should be removed from library shelves if they are deemed inappropriate. 

On one hand, library censorship protects members of the community from encountering objectionable materials, which could be of particular benefit to children and young adults who use the library. It is important for libraries to provide a safe space for patrons of all ages. Additionally, censorship shields members of the community from exposure to materials with offensive themes such as hate speech, violent content, and explicit language. 

On the other hand, censorship in libraries can also be detrimental, as it restricts access to knowledge and education. Libraries should strive to be an advocacy for the First Amendment and should remain a place where everyone has access to all resources. By censoring materials that contain certain words or scenes deemed inappropriate, the library can limit exposure to valuable sources of information, in turn creating an environment of intellectual suppression. Furthermore, censorship can be used as a "cloak of darkness" to hide a culture's persistent bias and bigotry, making it difficult to identify and address. 

Ultimately, whether or not certain materials should be removed from library shelves should be determined on a case-by-case basis and should include input from patrons, staff, and the community at large. The library should strive to provide appropriate materials while allowing the public unrestricted access to information available. In the end, it is the responsibility of libraries to serve as an advocate for expression
