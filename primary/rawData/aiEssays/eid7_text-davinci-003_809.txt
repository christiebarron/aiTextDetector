I was recently working in the customer service department at my job, and it was a very stressful day. We had been particularly busy, and I was the only one handling customers. A man had come in and presented a problem that I wasn't sure how to solve. He was getting more and more frustrated, but I remained patient and calmly tried to figure out his problem. After about a few minutes, I was able to come up with a solution and he thanked me for my patience and dedication to solving his issue. It's moments like these that remind me to stay calm and practice patience, even when it's difficult.
