I was out with some friends for a picnic at the park and we were having a great time, chatting and eating. Suddenly, one of my friends said something that made us all burst into laughter. Before I knew it, I was laughing so hard, I was almost in tears.

The more we laughed, the funnier it became, and before long we were all in uncontrollable hysterics. The sun was shining and birds were singing, and we all just let go, allowing our laughter to lift up and around us until there was nothing left but happiness and joy.

It felt so good to be laughing with my friends, to have that moment where we were all so connected and wrapped in the joy of our laughter. We had made the shortest possible distance between us through our shared laughter and I will always remember it with a warm heart.
