The Empire State Building was a massive architectural and engineering feat of the early 20th century. The building, which was completed in 1931, featured a 200 foot tall mooring mast that was designed to allow dirigibles, or large airships, to dock in order to transport passengers and merchant cargo from the mainland to New York City. Although the initial plans for the building featured the mooring mast, building the structure that connected to the building and making the dock a reality were two major obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.

Initially, the builders of the Empire State Building had difficulty in finding a way to connect the mooring mast to the building. Due to the mooring mast's height, it was difficult to properly secure it and ensure that the structure could safely withstand strong winds that accompanied storms. After much effort and testing of different designs, the engineers eventually developed a secure connection that could link the mast to the rest of the building.

The second major obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was finding a way to safely land an airship on the mooring mast without the craft crashing onto the street below. As a solution, the builders of the Empire State Building decided to install a pylon at the top of the mooring mast, which included a platform and a giant ball that the airship could use to safely moor itself. The pylon was designed to quickly move the ball up and down depending on wind conditions, as well as provide a secure and safe dock for the airship.

Despite the challenges of building a secure connection between the moor
