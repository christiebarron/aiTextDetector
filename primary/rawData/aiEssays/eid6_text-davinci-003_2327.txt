The construction of the Empire State Building posed many unique challenges, especially when it came to accommodating the docking of dirigibles, or large airships. This component of the building was included in the vision of the architects to create an iconic tower that could be easily accessible from the air. Unfortunately, providing a suitable tower top landing platform for dirigibles proved to be a difficult task due to the formidable engineering, economic and political obstacles that the builders had to overcome.

To begin with, engineers had to figure out the best way to provide a safe, stable and secure landing for the airships which proved to be a challenge due to the weight of the dirigibles. These giant craft had no wheels and were much too heavy to rest on any structure without causing a significant amount of structural strain. As a result, a special “mooring mast” was designed to provide a suitable mooring solution for the dirigibles. This mast would consist of a series of heavy steel cables connected to a large steel crossbeam which would stretch from the tower’s communication antenna at the top of the building.

The economic difficulties associated with constructing the mooring mast were also considerable. Since the tower needed to remain open while the mast was being installed, the costs of keeping the doors open had to be taken into account in the overall price of the mooring mast. Additionally, the pieces of the mast had to be carefully transported to the top of the building and installed in precise locations, all of which cost significant amounts of money to complete.

Finally, the success of the mooring
