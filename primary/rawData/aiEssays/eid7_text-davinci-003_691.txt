I remember that time when I was at work and my colleague was having a bad day. Everything was going wrong, they kept messing up and they were obviously having a tough time. I could see they were getting more and more frustrated and I was worried they were going to fly off the handle.

So, I decided to be patient. I could see they were trying their best and I chose to be understanding and tolerant rather than judgmental. I tried to stay calm, remain level-headed and I willed myself not to be critical of my colleague.

When things had settled a bit, we talked about what had gone wrong and how we could learn from it. My colleague was so grateful that I had helped to de-escalate the situation and that I had taken the time to be patient with them. It really made their day.
