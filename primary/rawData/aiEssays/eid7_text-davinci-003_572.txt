 

I used to work in a customer service department of a large company. My job was to provide assistance to customers who had complaints or inquiries. One day I had a customer that called in and was extremely frustrated. They were having trouble understanding how to use a certain feature and were getting very impatient with me. 

Rather than getting irritated and frustrated myself, I decided to stay calm and patient and attempt to help the customer. I would explain how the feature worked slowly, making sure to not talk over them. Throughout the call, I took my time, doing my best not to rush them and making sure that I answered all their questions. 

Eventually, the customer was able to better understand the feature and even thanked me for my patience. After the call was over, I felt proud of myself for remaining patient and helping the customer. It was a great feeling knowing I was able to work through the situation calmly and help them out in the end.
