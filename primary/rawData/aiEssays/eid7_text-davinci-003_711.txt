I like to consider myself a patient person, but I really had to put that to the test recently when I was traveling by bus. It had been a long journey and I was anxious to get home. What was supposed to be a three-hour long ride ended up being almost four and a half hours - much longer than I had expected.

At first, I was getting angry. I started to complain and grumble about the slow travel and the delay. But then I remembered the things that my parents had taught me - that it was important to stay patient and to remain kind, no matter what the situation. So instead of getting worked up, I simply took a few deep breaths and reminded myself to be patient. 

I looked out the window, listened to some music, and eventually I was able to relax a bit. It made such a big difference. When I finally reached my destination, I was still exhausted and a bit frustrated but much more relaxed. Patiently enduring the wait enabled me to stay calm and make the best of the situation.
