I was out on a first date with another person and I was a bit nervous. We had been chatting online for a while, but had finally decided to meet up in person. We were sitting at a restaurant enjoying some food and conversation when I started to get a bit more comfortable. 

Out of the blue, my date surprised me with a joke that made me chuckle. We both started to laugh from the joke, and soon we were both laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. It felt like we had known each other forever!

We spent the remainder of the night telling silly stories to each other and laughing about them. Those moments of laughter created an instant connection between us, and it was a moment I'll never forget. I truly believe that laughter can bring two people closer together and create a strong bond.
