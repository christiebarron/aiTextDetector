I was out for dinner with an old friend and we were having a great time catching up over some drinks. As we were chatting, I started to get the urge to break out into a full on belly laugh. There was some miscommunication between us and it made us both start to crack up. 

The more we laughed, the funnier it became, and soon we were laughing so hard that we attracted the attention of the other people in the restaurant. We must have appeared crazy, and I was worried we might get asked to leave, but instead, the waiter came over and said that he had never seen two people so in love and having so much fun.

It felt like a special moment and reminded me of why we have remained such good friends for all these years. We left the restaurant happy and content, still laughing, and it was such a joyous feeling that made me appreciate the laughter shared between us.
