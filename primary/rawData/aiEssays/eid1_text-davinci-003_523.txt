To the Editor:

As a member of our community, I would like to take this opportunity to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people today.

Given the ever-increasing presence of digital technology and the rapid development of artificial intelligence, it is clear that computers can have a profound impact on how we interact, learn, and even think. On the one hand, computers are capable of enormous productivity and efficiency, allowing us to access vast amounts of data, research and applications. On the other hand, they have the potential to distract us and modify our behavior, leading people to be less engaged with their surroundings, as well as each other.

While I recognize the tremendous advantages that computers can bring, I strongly believe that we should remain mindful of their potential drawbacks. By limiting screen time and encouraging people to unplug, we can maximize the benefits of computers while minimizing the dangers of over-reliance. We must vigilantly monitor our relationship with these devices, in order to ensure that our lives are enriched and improved, rather than isolated and isolated from the real world.

I ask all members of our community to consider the implications of computers on our lives, and stay mindful of the potential effects that can occur. Thank you for bringing this important issue to light.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
