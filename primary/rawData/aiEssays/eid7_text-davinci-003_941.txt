I was walking down the street, when an elderly man approached me with an urgent question. He asked if I knew where the nearest shoe store was. It had been a long day and I was tired, but I was determined to be respectful and patient. 

I could tell he was worried about something, but rather than rush him, I took my time and asked specific questions about what kind of shoes he was looking for. I also asked if there was anyone else he could call for help. He thanked me and said no. So, I stayed with him and took the time to explain how to use an app to find the closest shoe store.

As we talked, I also noticed that he was having a hard time understanding and I realized that this was going to take more time and patience on my end then I originally thought. So, I gave him clear instructions, step by step, repeating myself often and giving him plenty of time to process the information. 

Eventually, he was able to understand and thanked me before walking away. As I thought about this interaction later, I was reminded of how patient I had been and how much it had paid off. It was a good reminder of how a small act of patience can go a long way.
