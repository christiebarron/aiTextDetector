The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” invokes a powerful sense of hope and growth, despite the harsh winter faced by the people of her Chinese village. The final nine lines of the poem explain that if the protagonist passes the same test again in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus has begun to bud, then she will be able to leave the winter and move on with her life. In this line, Ho communicates that a period of darkness and loss has a time limit, and that soon the warmth of spring will bring in new life and hope.

Throughout the poem, Ho effectively paints a vivid picture of the villagers’ suffering and despair during the winter months. She focuses on the experience of making it through a particularly challenging and desperate part of life while still keeping faith that, at some point, spring will come again. This idea becomes especially powerful in the final lines, which serve to remind readers that while things may seem dark and dismal, a new beginning and fresh opportunities are not so far away.

The message behind "Winter Hibiscus" is an important one: resilience and perseverance, even during our darkest times, will be rewarded. Ho conveys her point by presenting the cyclical nature of life and ultimately urging readers to look forward to the new life the spring will bring. When the snows melt, the geese return and the hibiscus buds, then we will have the chance to test ourselves against that same challenge again, but with a renewed sense of hope and strength
