The Empire State Building was constructed in 1931 and it soon became the premier symbol of the booming yet dangerous days of the 1920s. The building was also equipped with an external structural addition that allowed dirigibles, which were large airships filled with gas, to dock. This novel innovation presented a number of obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order to successfully allow dirigibles to dock.

The greatest challenge for the builders of the Empire State Building was technical. Airships of this era were constructed using flammable materials such as silk and cotton and powered by flammable gases like hydrogen. Therefore, the builders had to ensure that the risk of a fire was minimized as much as possible. The builders also had to create an effective and secure mooring system to enable safe docking at the top of the building. The builders settled on a mooring system which involved the installation of a large metal mast atop the building which was originally used for the observation of weather conditions. Additionally, the mooring system had to be strong since it would bear the full weight of the airship when docked. 

The builders of the Empire State Building also had to account for the massive size of the airships in regards to manoeuvrability. Turning and slow descents were used when docking to increase the accuracy with which the airship would reach the mast. Despite this precautions, winds often made controlling the airship difficult which meant that many airships were not able to get close enough to the mast and subsequently crashed. This necessitated the installation of additional mooring lines to ensure that
