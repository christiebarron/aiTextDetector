I remember a time when I had been invited to a family gathering. I had a long and busy day at work and was feeling worn out when I arrived. Despite my fatigue, I made an effort to be polite and conscientious to everyone.

One of my relatives, an elderly man, started telling me a long and involved story in his usual loud voice. I knew the story by heart but didn't mind listening to it again. I stayed patient and listened, not glazing away or completely tuning out. Instead, I kept engaged by making the occasional comment or question to show I was paying attention. 

By the end of the evening, I felt exhausted but also proud that I had been a respectful and patient listener. Years later, I still remember the family gathering, and often reflect with pleasure on the effort I made to be patient that day.
