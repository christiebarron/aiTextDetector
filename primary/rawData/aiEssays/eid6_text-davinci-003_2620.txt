The construction of the Empire State Building was a major engineering feat that remains a marvel even today. However, one of the most ambitious and daring aspects of its design that was never realized was the inclusion of mooring masts to allow dirigibles to dock. Despite early enthusiasm and ambition, the obstacles faced by the builders proved to be too great to overcome.

The plans to build a mooring system at the top of the Empire State Building were described in 1932 in the book, “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. In it, the challenges faced by the builders were outlined including wind pressures, the cost of materials to withstand extreme weather, and the difficulty of mounting the masts to the building.

Wind pressures were one of the biggest challenges faced when designing the mooring mast. The wind blowing around the top of the building created a great deal of turbulence and made it difficult to secure the masts. Additionally, the masts had to be made of the heaviest and strongest materials available in order to withstand the strain. As a result, these materials were both expensive and difficult to work with, making them a major obstacle to overcome.

The difficulty of securing the masts on the building was also a factor. The Empire State Building was not built for aerial transport and therefore, it was not equipped to handle the installation of the mooring masts. Furthermore, the height of the mooring mast itself posed a challenge as it extended high above the building and further increased the difficulty of mounting it securely.

Finally, the idea of having
