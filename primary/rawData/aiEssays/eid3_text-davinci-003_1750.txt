In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist’s physical journey is paralleled by his emotional and mental journey. The setting of the story plays a large role in this journey, highlighting the strength and bravery the cyclist must show to keep pushing forward. 

The cyclist finds himself in a remote and desolate part of the desert. The obvious aspects of this setting are the intense heat and sun that make it difficult for him to breathe, the sand that constantly tries to throw him off the bicycle, and the lack of civilization providing comfort or familiarity. These direct elements of the setting lead the cyclist to feel physically and mentally exhausted by the time he climbs a tall hill.

Additionally, there are deeper aspects of the setting that affect him. As he travels, the cyclist is isolated from people, faces obstacles that are beyond his control, and is deprived of the creature comforts he enjoys in his everyday life. This creates a feeling of loneliness and helplessness that the cyclist has to cope with, testing his resolve and will to continue biking. By conquering this “wilderness” of the desert, the cyclist is able to gain a sense of accomplishment and pride.
