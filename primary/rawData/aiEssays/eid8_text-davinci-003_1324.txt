I never expected the bond I formed with my best friend to start with laughter, but it did. We met at a party, were both were feeling a bit awkward. Suddenly, we heard a noise coming from the kitchen that made us look at each other and burst into uncontrollable laughter. We had both heard of a mouse that had been making its rounds in the nearby apartment buildings, and sure enough, it had made its way into ours.

We were laughing so hard that our sides ached, and all of the other people at the party just stopped and looked at us like we were crazy. It was the start of a beautiful friendship. We still laugh about it whenever we get togetherâ€”we don't even have to mention the mouse for us to be overcome with fits of giggles. That moment was a defining one for us; it reminded us of how powerful and necessary laughter is in any relationship.
