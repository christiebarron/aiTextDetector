 

I remember when I was in my senior year of high school. With graduation just around the corner, I had to face a hectic schedule of college applications, exams, and extracurricular activities. I was feeling overwhelmed and worried that I wouldn’t be able to get everything done on time. Against all the odds, I was determined to finish everything I needed to do and remain patient throughout the process. 

I managed the stress by taking small breaks throughout the day, connecting to friends and family, and treating myself to things I enjoyed. No matter what happened, I stayed positive and kept reminding myself that everything would eventually get done. I had faith in my own abilities and was patient with the results.

In the end, I was able to submit all my college applications on time and did my best on the exams. Things worked out as well as I expected, and I couldn’t have done it without being patient with myself.
