Laughter has always been something that has filled me with joy, so when I came across an old friend of mine in the bookstore, I couldn’t help but be excited. I hadn’t seen him in years, but something felt familiar as soon as I spotted him.

He spied me at the same time, and with a smile, he called out my name. I walked towards him, and what started out as a polite, catching-up kind of conversation almost immediately turned into something else entirely due to both of our uncontrollable fits of laughter. It felt as though we had never been apart, despite the years that had passed!

We laughed about old memories and shared funny stories about our lives. We found ourselves in a competition to see who could make the other laugh the hardest. It didn’t matter that people around us were staring—the comfort and familiarity of being in each other’s company made up for any judgmental looks. 

Before we knew it, two hours had gone by, and it felt as though no time had passed at all! We said our goodbyes with hearty hugs and the promise to catch up again soon. On that day, I was grateful to have someone that could make me laugh so easily and without fail. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people—it doesn’t matter how much time has passed; when you find that shared joy that laughter brings, it’s like no time has passed at all.
