The Empire State Building was one of the most ambitious construction projects of its time, taking over a year and a half to build and inspiring awe with its sheer size and structure. One particularly intriguing aspect of the building’s construction was the possibility that it might be able to provide a port for dirigibles, or airships, to dock. However, there were many obstacles that had to be overcome in order to make this a reality.

The first problem was the need to create a tall and sturdy structure that could support an airship’s weight. The architects consulted with the US Navy and consulted experts on the use of steel and mooring masts. After the design was finalized, construction began and the mooring mast was installed at the 102nd floor. The mast was 106 feet tall and had to be hand-welded while workers toiled in dangerous conditions.

Second, the engineers had to ensure that the mooring mast was situated in a way that would maximize the efficiency of airships docking at the Empire State Building. To accomplish this, the mast was capped with a reflective, 7.5-foot cone and equipped with an automatic system to ease the hook-and-cable docking procedure.

The third obstacle was the need for a reliable source of power to be able to lift the huge dirigibles. The electric motors needed to lift the airships were much more powerful than any invention at the time, and these motors were tested in an electric wind tunnel before being incorporated into the Empire State Building. This allowed the electric motors to handle the heavy loads of
