The Empire State Building was constructed with the aim of allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. It represented a bold vision for its time, a vision of a future where travelers could fly from anywhere in the world and dock on the Empire State Building. Although the technological advances of the era made this dream possible, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in achieving it. 

The first obstacle was the size of the building. The Empire State Building was supposed to be 1,250 feet high, considerably taller than the tallest buildings at the time. This posed unique problems with regards to the engineering and design of the building, as its size meant that it had to be structurally reinforced to accommodate the additional weight of a dirigible. Another problem was that the air currents around the building were completely different to what dirigible captains were used to, meaning special landing equipment had to be designed to ensure the dirigible stayed in place.

A second obstacle was the lack of a “mooring mast” either on the building or in the nearby area. This made it difficult for dirigibles to dock and stay in place, as everything from the wind, the wake of passing ships, and the ever-present risk of collisions could cause a dirigible to drift away and become dangerously unstable. The Empire State Building’s designers considered various solutions, including placing mooring cables on the building itself, building huge “mooring towers” nearby, and constructing a “mooring mast” on the building that dirigibles could latch onto. The latter proved to be
