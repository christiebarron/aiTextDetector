I was spending a lazy Saturday morning with my best friend, reading and chatting on the porch of her cottage in the countryside. We had stayed up late the night before discussing everything from work worries to childhood memories, and had been up since dawn cooking breakfast. 

As we settled onto the swing and caught the first rays of morning sunshine, something funny came to mind: the secret language we had invented as kids. Out of nowhere, I started imitating the sounds and hand motions we used to communicate back then and soon my friend joined in. We spent the next 10 minutes recreating our secret code, laughing at how silly we must look while doing it. 

The simple act of slipping back into that moment of childhood joy brought us closer together. We were two adults, laughing together with unreserved childish glee. It was a reminder of how easy it is to reconnect with one another and how laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
