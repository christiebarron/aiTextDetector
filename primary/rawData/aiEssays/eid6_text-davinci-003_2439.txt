The construction of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge to the builders, as it required the installation of a mooring mast to allow dirigibles to dock. Though the convenience of dirigibles was a major draw of the era, the mooring project was fraught with obstacles. 

One of the most difficult hurdles included convincing financiers of the feasibility of the mooring process. This was due to the height of the mooring mast, which was unprecedented. At 600 feet above street level, the mooring mast was more than double the total height of any previous mast. Simple physics argued that the mast would be subject to massive stress and strain, putting any dirigible or passengers onboard at risk. 

Another challenge the builders faced was ensuring that the mooring mast would be able to handle the logistical constraints of mooring a dirigible. The Empire State Building’s mast had to be able to handle a stationary ship as well as an airborne one, as the mooring process involved multiple drafts and docks in various forms. Designers had to consider every aspect of tying off the ship, including the forces that the different mooring points and the overall size of the ship would produce.  

Finally, the builders had to contend with public concerns about the weight of the dirigibles. Due to the size of the ship, some people were concerned about the structural implications of allowing a dirigible to dock atop the mast. To assuage these worries, an experienced team of engineers developed an innovative series of “N”-shaped steel cables
