The Empire State Building was a marvel of architectural innovation renowned for its sheer size and beauty. The tall structure was designed with one revolutionary feature – the ability to moor dirigibles in its upper floors. Although the original architects and builders had high hopes for its success, they soon encountered several major obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock safely.

The Empire State Building was situated in a congested area of New York, which presented a number of logistical difficulties. Most of the buildings surrounding the Empire State were too low or too narrow to accommodate the large dirigibles, and none of them had the necessary space for a viable entrance. In addition, the upper reaches of the building were too high for the dirigibles to reach safely. If a dirigible accidently overshot its mark, it could blow into a neighboring building or travel off course onto a street below.

To solve the problem, engineers and builders proposed the use of mast technology, specifically the “mooring mast,” which is a type of sturdy metal structure with cables and restraints to guide the dirigible’s descent. Installations of mooring masts on the 96th floor, the rooftop garden, and the antenna above it enabled the large dirigibles to safely dock without causing any damage to the neighboring buildings or the Empire State itself.

The implementation of the mooring mast presented another major obstacle – the height of the building. The mooring mast had to be securely affixed to the roof of the Empire State Building, which was 872 feet off the ground. To the dismay of the
