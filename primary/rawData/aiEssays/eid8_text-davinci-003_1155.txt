I will never forget the first time my husband and I laughed together. 

We had just started dating and had gone out to dinner together. To make conversation, I told him a light-hearted joke and waited for his reaction. He stared at me for a few too many seconds, in what felt like an eternity. I started to feel embarrassed for even telling the joke. Suddenly, ever so slowly, he started to chuckle. His chuckle grew and grew until it broke into a hearty laugh filled with joy and light. He doubled over in laughter and tears started to roll down his face. I couldn't help but join in as I started to laugh along with him. 

It was one of those beautiful moments that I will never forget â€“ the moment I shared laughter with my husband.
