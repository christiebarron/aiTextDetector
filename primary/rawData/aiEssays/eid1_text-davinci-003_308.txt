Dear Editor,

Technology, specifically the computer, has fundamentally changed the way people communicate with one another. It has allowed us to connect with people all around the world in ways we could have never imagined before. Despite the wonderful advancements, the computer does have some negative impacts on people.

To begin with, spending too much time using a computer can lead to poor physical health. Spending hours at a time sitting in front of a monitor and clicking away at the mouse can lead to a lack of physical activity, which can lead to weight gain and an overall sedentary lifestyle. Furthermore, the bright blue light emanating from the computer screen can affect our sleeping patterns, disrupting our natural circadian cycles and leading to fatigue and decreased productivity.

Additionally, people can become dependent on their computers and can become consumed by the internet and its vast information. The internet has become such a powerful tool and can be used to gain access to anything and everything, that one could become addicted or dependent to the point of potentially losing their job or missing out on life experiences due to excessive internet use. Furthermore, the immediacy and convenience of computers can lead to people relying on them for everything instead of going out and exploring the world.

In conclusion, although computers do offer us many advantages, they also have some negative side effects on people. We must be aware of these potential drawbacks and take measures to ensure that we are leading healthy and balanced lives.

Sincerely,

[Your
