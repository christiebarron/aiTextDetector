I was sitting in my living room with my friends one evening, feeding off of the energy of each others’ odd humor. We had all been out of college for a few years now, but we still laughed the same stupid jokes we did back in our dorms. As we traded jokes and shared memories, I couldn't help but smile at the familiar feeling of being surrounded by those I love. 

I looked around and noticed we were all wearing some kind of ridiculous getup – my friend in a bright pink wig, another with a ninja mask and yet another wearing a chef hat. We couldn't help but laugh at each other's absurdity, and the more we laughed, the more ridiculous the looks became. 

We made up stories about each of our ensembles and poked fun at each other for our chosen attire. It was full of laughter, and for that moment, it felt like no time had passed since we had all been kids together. 

When the laughter eventually subsided, I was filled with a calming warmth. I realized that laughter has a way of connecting us, no matter our age or the time that might have passed between us. It is a soothing reminder of the relationships we have known and a powerful bridge to new friendships. 

That night, I was reminded of the importance of laughter in my life – both in relationships with those I know and those I have yet to meet. It has the power to make us feel connected, even when physically apart.
