I remember it like it was yesterday: the time I shared a really honest laugh with my best friend. We hadn't seen each other in months, so when we did finally meet up, we were desperate to catch up on everything. 

At the beginning of our conversation, we discussed how weird life had been since we last saw each other. There had been a lot of highs and lows, and we couldn't ignore the more uncomfortable topics. 

It wasn't like we were trying to make light of any of it—far from it— but we did somehow end up making a joke out of the whole situation. It wasn't even that funny—we were just so relieved to be able to laugh about something. 

As the joke spread, it only got funnier, and our laughter grew until we were both in tears. It was the kind of laughter that comes from the sheer relief of being able to talk about things without any judgement. 

That was the start of many conversations we shared with each other, and I'm sure that when we eventually drift apart, this moment will stay close to my heart forever.
