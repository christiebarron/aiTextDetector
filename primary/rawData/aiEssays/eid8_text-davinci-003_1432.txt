My best friend and I have known each other since preschool, and over the years we've gone through some tough times together. From breakups and family drama to academic successes and graduation milestones, we can take it all in strideâ€”mostly because of the laughter that we share.

A few weeks ago, we were having lunch on the kitchen table, and we had been chatting for a while. Eventually, we exhausted our topics of conversation and just sat there, looking at each other in silence. Then suddenly, my friend cracked a joke that made me laugh so hard I nearly fell off my chair. We just kept laughing and talking and reminiscing until we both now had tears streaming down our cheeks. We made up new jokes and laughed until we were in too much pain to keep going. It was moments like that that made our friendship so special and so strong. 

No matter how hard times get, we always have each other and we can always find humor in our situations and use it to bring us together. Nothing beats a good joke and the special moment of stillness that comes from laughter shared between two people.
