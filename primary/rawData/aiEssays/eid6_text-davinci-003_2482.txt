The Empire State Building presented a major challenge for its builders when it came to constructing a dock for airships, or dirigibles, to attach to and land on. The obstacle that had to be overcome was the fact that the mooring mast concept had never been successfully used before. For an airborne vessel to safely dock on the mast, known as a mooring mast, a number of novel innovations would have to be successfully implemented, and the engineers and architects at the time faced numerous challenges in achieving the feat. 

The first challenge was the fact that the mast had to be extremely tall, tall enough to accommodate the large airships and also strong enough to hold them in place. Additionally, the mast not only had to be tall but also thin, due to the weight concerns of the construction. The engineers had to devise methods to ensure that the mast remained stable when the airships were attached and that the craft would be secure during its docking procedure.

It was also recognized that some sort of downward force would be necessary to hold the airship in place while it was moored to the mast, and the builders had to devise a counterbalancing system to securely hold the airship in place. Alongside this, the opening on the top of the mast was designed so that the airship would have a safe way of entering and exiting the dock. 

Finally, since the mooring mast was designed to be used for commercial purposes, the engineers also had to make sure that a system to transfer passengers between the airships and the building's roof was also put in place, so that crew
