I still remember it like it was yesterday. I had just started dating my now-husband about six months prior, and the relationship was still new and exciting for us. We were at my parentsâ€™ house for dinner and my mom had made a really delicious curry. As we were all sitting at the table, I was talking to my dad, who was sarcastically ribbing my husband as if he were his own son. My husband, in true fashion, started mimicking my dad back, trying to outdo him in the sarcasm game. This went back and forth a few times, until finally we all burst out with unstoppable laughter. It was such a light and happy moment.

My parents had been so hesitant about our relationship early on, so for them to be having a laugh with him was a sign that all was going well. I could tell in that moment that my parents really liked him, and it made me proud and relieved. We still laugh about that evening to this day, and it remains one of my favorite memories of our relationship so far. Laughter truly is the best medicine and the shortest distance between two people.
