I was working on a difficult project when I encountered a major roadblock. I was stuck and didn't know what to do next. I could feel myself getting frustrated and angry, but I decided to take a few deep breaths and remain patient. 

I tried to stay calm and reminded myself that I was up against something larger than myself and that it would be worth being patient if I could figure it out. So I gathered my thoughts and looked at the problem from a different angle.

After about an hour of intense concentration, I finally found a solution. I was relieved and felt a wave of satisfaction come over me. I was so glad that I had remained patient. It would have been so much easier to give up and throw a temper tantrum, but I'm glad that I chose to stay patient. It was a great reminder that good things come to those who wait.
