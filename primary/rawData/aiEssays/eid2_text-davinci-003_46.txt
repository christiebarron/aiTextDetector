When it comes to libraries, censorship is a controversial but necessary subject. In this day and age, libraries carry a variety of materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, that can be considered offensive to certain groups of people. In order to uphold the standard of fairness and respect to all individual’s beliefs and values, certain materials must be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. 

Libraries should be a safe and unbiased space where individuals of all backgrounds can feel comfortable browsing and discovering new works of art. Allowing controversial materials to remain on the shelves can have a negative effect on the environment of the library –artworks containing graphic violence or sexually explicit scenes are likely to disturb or offend other members of the library community, keeping them from accessing the other literature. Censorship also serves to protect the minds of children, who may not have the maturity to handle some of the more controversial topics or materials. 

However, censorship can also be highly subjective, depending on the beliefs and values of the library’s staff or community. It is important that censorship decisions be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with the spirit of respecting freedom of speech at the forefront. Criteria should be established to ensure that there is an established set of guidelines that indicate when a piece of literature falls under the grounds of censorship. The established criteria should also ensure that only truly offensive materials are removed, as it is important to protect our right to freedom of speech, even if it is uncomfortable. 

In conclusion, censorship is a delicate topic, especially when it comes to libraries
