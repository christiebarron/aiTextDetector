As an avid reader, I am deeply concerned about the issue of censorship in libraries. In this day and age when information is easily accessible and ideas are more freely exchanged, it is of utmost importance that libraries remain accessible to all citizens and that they are not subject to censorship.

It is true that there are materials found in libraries that could be considered offensive to some people. It is also true that libraries should provide materials that adhere to certain standards. However, simply removing any material that someone finds offensive is not the right solution. Libraries should consider each case on an individual basis, working with the community to come to an appropriate solution and actively promoting an open dialogue about the merits of the material in question.

Rather than removing materials from the library, librarians should provide guidance for individuals and families as to which materials are most appropriate for them to explore. Librarians should set and abide by standards of decency but should also provide guidance as to why certain materials may be considered offensive or inappropriate. This allows individuals to make their own decisions on what materials they do or do not wish to explore.

It is important to remember that censorship serves to limit access to knowledge and the free exchange of ideas. No matter a person's beliefs or values, libraries should remain unbiased, open places for the public to exchange ideas and gain valuable information. As such, censorship in libraries may rob citizens of the right to explore materials and make their own decisions. In light of this, I urge all libraries to promote open dialogue and guide patrons, rather than relying on censorship as a primary means of controlling access to materials.
