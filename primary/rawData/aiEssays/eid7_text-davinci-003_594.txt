I was fifteen years old when my mother came to me with a strange request - she asked me to take care of my little brother for the day. It was summer, and my mom was working extra hours at her day job and had to miss an important meeting. My brother was only five at the time, and although I was worried about his behavior, I kept my cool, and agreed to do it. 

We went for a little walk before lunch, and my brother started asking me about the strange-looking rocks and leaves he was seeing around us. I was a bit tired and wanted to finish the walk quickly but I took the time to explain each thing he was curious about and he thanked me with a big smile. Later at lunch, I thought he was finished eating, but he asked me for a few pieces of fruit. I was getting impatient, but I took a deep breath, and patiently waited while he finished the pieces one by one. 

When the day finally ended, my mom thanked me for going above and beyond to take care of him. I was proud of myself and felt a sense of accomplishment for being able to be patient when needed.
