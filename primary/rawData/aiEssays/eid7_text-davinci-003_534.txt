I remember the time I was at a restaurant and I was waiting for my order. It had been over thirty minutes since I had put in my order. I was getting agitated, but I decided to take a deep breath and remain patient. Several other tables around me had been served their food and I was starting to get frustrated.

The server finally approached my table and informed me that the kitchen was backed up and my food was coming soon. I thanked her for the update. I didn't say anything else and gave her a polite smile to show that I was not angry.

When my food finally arrived, it was worth the wait. I enjoyed every bite and was glad that I had taken the time to be patient. Being patient can make all the difference between an ordinary experience and a pleasant one.
