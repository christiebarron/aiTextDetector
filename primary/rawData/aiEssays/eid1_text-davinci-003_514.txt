Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance, so does the presence of computers in our everyday lives. With this new face of technology, comes a variety of effects on people. 

I believe that computers have a net positive effect on individuals, as well as society as a whole. Computers help people stay connected and facilitate a new form of communication which connects people who would have never been able to communicate before. This increases cultural understanding, knowledge sharing, and the potential for collaboration. 

Furthermore, computers are an excellent source of education and entertainment. They offer an incredible variety of resources to people of all ages and can provide access to materials that would otherwise not be available. Computers also allow people to take part in activities that can benefit society such as creating models and simulations, designing new products, and manipulating digital media. 

On top of these advantages, computers help increase a personâ€™s problem-solving and analytical skills. They provide an efficient way of organizing information, and with the introduction of artificial intelligence, computers are able to offer personalized and contextualized guidance. 

In conclusion, I believe that the effects of computers on people are mostly positive. They offer unprecedented opportunities for communication and learning, and can even help boost analytical and problem-solving skills. I urge readers to consider the benefits of having access to computers. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
