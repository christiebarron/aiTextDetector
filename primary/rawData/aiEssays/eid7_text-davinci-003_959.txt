I recall a time when I was extremely patient. When I was first starting out in my career, I was challenged with a very demanding project. The project would require me to work late hours and weekends, but I was determined to make it a success.

Despite all the hard work and long hours, I remained patient and focused. I welcomed criticism and welcomed suggestions. I was careful not to snap out of frustration and I kept a positive attitude.

The project eventually paid off and I was proud of how quickly it came together. It felt like a great accomplishment and I was proud that I was able to finish it while keeping my patience and resilience. I knew the hard work was worth it and the result was worth celebrating.
