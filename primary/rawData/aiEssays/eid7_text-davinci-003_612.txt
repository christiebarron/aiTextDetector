I recently had to go to the DMV to renew my driver's license. The line was long, and a couple people in front of me were having difficulties due to paperwork issues that held the process up. Even though the wait was long and frustrating, I remained patient. I understood that the employees were trying their best to help everyone in the line, and I trusted that my time would eventually come. I stayed focused on the task at hand and while some customers complained, I was content to have a book and just wait it out. After quite some time, I was finally able to get up to the window and complete my license renewal. Everyone's patience was rewarded in the end.
