I remember the first time I met my partner. We had been getting to know each other online for a few weeks, but it was the first time we were meeting up in person. We had planned to go for dinner, but when I arrived, it was clear they weren’t feeling it. They weren’t eating and barely talking, so I knew I had to do something to lighten the mood.

That’s when I told them my signature silly joke that usually always gets a good reaction. It had something to do with a firetruck and a penguin, I don’t remember the exact words here, but before I knew it we had both started cracking up. It was something about the way the joke just caught us off guard that made us laugh.

The ice was broken and conversation flowed freely after that. We talked the rest of the night, laughing more and more as we shared funny stories from our lives. It felt like no matter how many times I told the same firetruck & penguin joke, it just kept getting funnier as the night went on. 

That night was the start of a beautiful relationship, and it all started with laughter.
