I recently had an opportunity to experience patience firsthand. I recently flew on an international flight and it was delayed several times. I was very frustrated but decided to remain patient as I knew there was nothing I could do. The airline kept giving updates on the delays, apologizing for the inconvenience, and offering us complimentary snacks and beverages. 

I kept my cool and delayed my plans for the evening. Instead of stressing out about the situation, I decided to relax and take the opportunity to get to know my fellow passengers. We shared stories and laughed together which made the time go faster. 

Eventually, the airline was able to get us on our way. I was very grateful that I was able to stay patient throughout the entire situation. I'm sure it would have been much worse if I had made a fuss or tried to make a scene. In the end, it was an experience that I'm sure my fellow passengers and I will never forget.
