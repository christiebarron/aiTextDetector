I remember it like it was yesterday - the laughter that filled the room with so much joy.

My best friend and I had been stuck in the library all day studying for a big test. Both of us were pretty stressed out, so I yelled out, "We gotta do something fun to break up this stress!"

My friend's eyes lit up and he yelled back, "I know just the thing!" He then proceeded to tell me this hilarious story he heard the other day, and I couldn't help but break into laughs. 

The other students around us weren't too happy at first, but eventually, their laughter joined ours. Pretty soon, the whole library was filled with deafening laughter â€” no more stress, just pure happiness and joy! 

We laughed until our stomachs hurt, and in that moment, I thought to myself that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. No matter how much we differ, we all can connect through the power of laughter.
