The construction of the Empire State Building in the early 20th century presented a unique challenge to engineers and builders. Not only did it have to be the tallest building in the world at the time, but it also had to account for an unprecedented technological innovation: docking of dirigibles. While this new form of transportation had significant potential for revolutionizing travel, the difficulties involved in constructing a structure to accommodate these large, cumbersome aircraft posed a host of challenges for the Empire State Building’s builders.

The biggest obstacle the Empire State Building’s builders faced was the lack of knowledge and information. At the time, building techniques were not yet advanced enough to guarantee a stable and secure structure to support the weight of a dirigible. Moreover, the materials available were generally too weak to offer the necessary strength and durability. As such, the architects had to devise a new engineering design. 

One of their solutions was the addition of a mooring mast. This unique structure was built atop the Empire State Building to provide a point of contact for the dirigibles and to reduce the risk of high winds impacting the aircraft. The mooring mast technically was a steel tower, partially surrounded by a steel net and equipped with two cables that had to be attached to the dirigible’s docking rack. The steel net served as another safeguard against weather and movement-related risks for the aircraft.

In addition to the mooring mast construction concerns, the Empire State Building’s architects also had to consider the added risk of gas explosion from the dirigibles. To minimize this danger, the mast
