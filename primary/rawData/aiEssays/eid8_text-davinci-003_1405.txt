I remember the first time I laughed with my best friend, as if it were yesterday. We had just started high school, and had become friends out of convenience, rather than any real connection. We had the same classes, so naturally we'd end up chatting during lunch. 

One day we were in the cafeteria and were attempting to make a pasta salad. We'd found all the ingredients and were mixing them together, when I made an offhand comment about how terrible it would taste. My friend suddenly burst out laughing and I couldn't help but join her. 

Next thing I know, we're both laughing and can't seem to stop. We just kept laughing and laughing long after the salad was made and eaten. Our laughter was nothing other than contagious, and before long the entire cafeteria was laughing with us.

After that day, we realized how strong our bond had become and how happy we were to be able to enjoy moments like that with each other. We were so in sync and connected, like we'd been friends for life. 

Laughter is indeed the shortest distance between two people. It has opened new, exciting chapters for our friendship and helped us bond even further.
