I was seated in a crowded bus, as I was getting home from work. There weren't any vacant seats and the passengers were tightly packed. As the bus went through its route, more people were getting on and the aisle was becoming increasingly congested. I was getting tired and increasingly frustrated by the situation but I still kept my composure.

Finally, after a long wait, a man standing in front of me signaled the driver to let him off at the next stop. As soon as the doors opened and he stepped off, an elderly lady grabbed his seat. Despite feeling exhausted, I allowed her to have the seat and stayed on my feet. I reminded myself to be patient and stay positive.

After a while, a woman hugged me and thanked me for giving up my seat to the elderly. I just smiled at the woman. I was truly happy to let the elderly have the seat and it made me feel good that the woman noticed and appreciated my patience. 

Although patience is challenging in times of discomfort, it is indeed a sign of kindness, strength and understanding.
