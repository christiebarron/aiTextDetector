I remember that one night when the 3 of us, my best friend, grandma and I had stayed up late, having a conversation about all sorts of things. We were all exhausted but still laughing our heads off, reminiscing about funny moments from our past. 

Grandma was the first one to laugh and it was contagious. Any time one of us tried to tell a joke, even if it wasn't funny, we all ended up in fits of laughter! We talked about growing older, embarrassing moments, missed opportunities and so much more. I could barely contain myself, my sides were aching with laughter.

At one point, Grandma brought up a funny childhood anecdote of mine, I had totally forgotten about it and started to laugh uncontrollably. That's when Grandma looked over at me with a twinkle in her eye and said, "You know, laughter is the shortest distance between two people."

Those words have since become a motto that I use in all kinds of situations. Whenever I find myself feeling stressed, overwhelmed or conflicted, I just think back to that moment and how it shifted the energy in the room, bringing us closer than ever. That's why I truly believe that laughter is the best kind of healing.
