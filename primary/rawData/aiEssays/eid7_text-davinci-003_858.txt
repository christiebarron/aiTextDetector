I remember when I was living in my old apartment, and my neighbor's loud music was blaring every night. I wanted to say something, but at the same time, I could tell she was having a hard time. One day I decided to have a little talk with her and kindly ask her if she could lower the volume of the music. She immediately apologized and told me about her difficult situation. While it was frustrating at times to constantly hear the loud music, I was patient with her and I understood. I gave her some advice and she slowly stopped playing the music so loud. We eventually became good friends, and I was glad I was patient with her.
