I recently had a laugh-filled evening with my best friend that I will never forget. We had decided to just hang out and watch a few movies, but I could tell it was going to be different from our typical Sunday evenings.

The moment we began talking, it felt as though the floodgates of laughter had opened. We talked about our lives, our dreams, and all the funny moments that had happened throughout the week. Soon, we were both rolling with laughter and it felt like no amount of laughter we could’ve had before could compare with the joy and happiness we were experiencing. 

This went on for several hours and the phone calls we made only managed to keep the laughter going even longer. I hadn’t laughed this much in a long time and seeing my friend so happy and carefree made me realize just how much of a blessing it is to have someone who understands you and supports you enough to be comfortable enough to let loose and have a harmless, joyful time together. 

We talked until we were too exhausted to talk any longer and soon enough it was time to call it a night. And although our night together had come to an end, I can’t help but to look back and smile on the laughter-filled memories we made.
