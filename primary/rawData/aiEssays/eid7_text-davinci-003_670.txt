When I was growing up, my family moved quite a bit. Every time we moved, I had to spend weeks adapting to my new environment and making new friends. 

When I was 9 years old, we moved to a small town in rural Oregon and settling in was especially difficult for me. I had a hard time with the transition and often felt overwhelmed, frustrated, and lonely. 

My parents were very patient with me during this time. They tried hard to make me feel welcome and at home in our new home. They kept up conversations with me, asked me how I was doing, and listened to my stories. They encouraged me to meet new people and gave me the chance to join any clubs or hobbies that I wanted to. 

Although it was tough to shift to my new life initially, their patience enabled me to grow and learn to love my new life.  In addition, I learned the important lesson of patience in times of discomfort and difficulty.
