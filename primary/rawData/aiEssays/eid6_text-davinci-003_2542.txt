The Empire State Building has a long and fascinating architectural history that includes the ambitious plan to create a docking port for dirigibles at the top. The well-known skyscraper in New York City was designed so that ships and planes could be transported to the upper levels, yet the port idea was cut short by regulations and engineering challenges. This essay will discuss the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The difficulties in creating an appropriate docking station for dirigibles began in the design process. The original architect, William Lamb, included “mooring masts” in his plans for the building. A mooring mast is a tower or spire used for securing the ship or aircraft for a short period of time. In order for pilots to navigate to the ideal mooring point, the spire was to be painted in a specific way, outlined by the Bureau of Air Commerce. However, this would have interfered with the aesthetic plan Lamb had in place, so the mooring mast was never completed.

Another obstacle to building a usable docking station was the regulation set by the Bureau of Air Commerce. Back in the 1930s, there were strict safety and moment regulations set by the bureau in order to protect against potential excess loads. The ESB’s mooring mast was only intended for ships up to two-thirds the size of a typical airship. Therefore, the airship would be too large to dock, and the bureau would not approve it as a viable option.

The engineering of the ESB also posed its own
