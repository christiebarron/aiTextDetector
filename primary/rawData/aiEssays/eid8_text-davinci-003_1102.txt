I remember the first time I met my soon-to-be best friend. We had both just started a summer camp for children - me as a counselor and her in the role of Red Cross nurse. As we worked through the registration process, I could tell we had a natural chemistry; we fell into easy conversation and had the same sense of humor.

As the campers began to arrive, we found ourselves working side by side. Amidst the chaos of a dozen little kids, it was easy to get overwhelmed - but every time something embarrassing or humorous happened, we found ourselves quietly laughing together.

Near the end of the day, I had developed a running joke with a group of kids. They had been asking me to crack open a coconut - something I had never done - and the air of anticipation was so thick. When the moment came, I made an exaggerated show of effort to get the coconut open, then tipped it over my head so its contents spilled onto the ground.

While everyone else just stared in amazement, my new friend doubled over with laughter. I couldn't help join in, and it felt like we had been friends for years. 

That moment of laughter set the tone for our entire friendship. To this day, we share that special kind of humor that only two people can share. Whenever we're together, there's always that spark of laughter - like we are both just remembering that moment when it all began.
