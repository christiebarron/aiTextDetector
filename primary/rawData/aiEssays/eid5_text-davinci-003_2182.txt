Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a mood of both nostalgia and strength as he reflects on his family, his memories, and his inspiring journey as a fashion designer.

The memoir begins in his childhood, as he vividly recalls a life filled with family â€“ being sent to Cuba in the summers, growing up in a Puerto Rican-Cuban home with 8 siblings, and being surrounded by an abundance of warmth, love and laughter. He writes with an overwhelming sense of fondness and nostalgia as he reminisces about these memories and the positive influence his supportive family had on his life.

Rodriguez goes on to reflect on his professional success and early difficulties as a fashion designer. Having come from a culture that was seemingly at odds with his career aspirations, he recounts the promises he made to himself and the strength he had to draw on to make his goals happen. While his father insisted that he learn the family business, Rodriguez channelled his grit and resolve to achieve his own dreams. Through his successes and setbacks, he persevered and has now earned renown for his unique and innovative fashion designs.

In sum, the mood in From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of nostalgia, strength, and pride. From the family gatherings and cultural heritage that shaped his upbringing, to the struggle of forging his own career, Rodriguez eloquently captures both the joys and trials of a life lived with passion and dedication.
