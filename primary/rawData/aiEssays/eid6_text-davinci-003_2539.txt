The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City allowed for unprecedented airship traffic. The idea of docking an airship on the roof of the building captured the public’s imagination but presented a number of obstacles to the building's builders. These obstacles included structural and safety concerns, as well as the addition of the necessary equipment for mooring.

The first challenge was the structural integrity of the building to withstand the strain of mooring a large airship. To counter this, the builders reinforced the upper levels of the building by adding additional steel beams. These reinforced floors would bear the weight of moored airships. Additionally, internal walls were added to create additional compartments for airship lines and controls. The floors of the building had to also be made resilient to withstand the additional stress when lowered and secured from the outside.

The second obstacle was safety. Due to the precarious nature of docking an airship at such a height, it was important that the process be done correctly and securely. This meant planning the layout of the rooftop carefully and adding stabilizing features such as a steel mooring mast and an array of guide wires to keep the airship steady. Additionally, thanks to the building’s design, the airship crew would be able to enter the building without having to lower its hull.

Finally, the builders had to decide whether to add the necessary equipment for docking or to keep the rooftop clear of obstacles. Due to the size and weight of the equipment, it was decided to only install it when needed. This equipment included a mooring mast, guide wires and
