Narciso Rodriguez's memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' is a powerful exploration of the feelings and emotions that are tied to the concept of ‘home’. Through Rodriguez's intimate musings, readers are transported on a journey  that displays poignancy, tenderness, joy, and sorrow.

The sentimentality of the work is palpable from the very start of the book. The memoir begins with an intimate look into the relationship between Rodriguez and his mother, with the memories of childhood and their connection instantly creating a tone of nostalgia. As the story progresses, this nostalgia is sustained and intertwined with personal reflections on the profound beauty in everyday moments - moments of family, of friendship, of nature, and of culture.

Throughout the narrative, Rodriguez conveys his emotions in a profound yet subtle manner, highlighting moments of both joy – from the liberty of a bright summer day in the park to the delight of reuniting with family – and sorrow – from the pain of personal loss to the despair of being an outsider in a new place. These emotional nuances, both positive and negative, create a melancholic atmosphere that lingers without becoming overtly oppressive.

Ultimately, Narciso Rodriguez’s 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' gives readers an opportunity to step away from everyday life and practice a powerful form of reflective therapy. The memoir's gentle yet strong focus on nostalgia has the power to awaken feelings long forgotten as well as to rekindle fond memories, creating a chillingly familiar mood that retains its resonance long after the book is read.
