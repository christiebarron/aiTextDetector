It was a typical Monday morning and I had stayed up late studying for a big test the following day. The alarm efficiently got me out of bed, but I was definitely still feeling the effects of a long weekend. As I groggily walked into my first period class, I had no idea I was about to find the pick-me-up I so desperately needed.

As I settled into my seat in the back of the room, my teacher just happened to be telling a funny story. I hadn't heard enough to understand the context, but by the end of the story I was already laughing. Out of nowhere, my teacher made eye contact with me, as if to say that she could hear my suppressed laughter and noticed me as an individual. In that moment, my laughing fit finally released and the entire room was filled with the sweet sound of my own.

The teachers laughter was contagious and soon enough the whole room was laughing and enjoying her comical stories. It was a unique bonding experience for the class and I, and it started our semester off with a very light-hearted atmosphere. Even the ones who were exhausted from their weekend had smiles on their faces. Instead of dreading Mondays, we now looked forward to starting the week off with a good laugh.

I'm so grateful for the laughter that filled that room that day. It created a special connection that my teacher and I still share today. I can't wait to find out what funny story she will tell in class next week!
