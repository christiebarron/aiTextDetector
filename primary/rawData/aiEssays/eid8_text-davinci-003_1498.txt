I had been friends with Natalie for a few years, but for some reason, it had taken me until that moment to realize just how much I enjoyed her company. We were out on a jog one night, when I finally got up the courage to make a joke.

I don't remember exactly what I said, but I know that when I said it, she started laughing hysterically. I had never heard her laugh like that before and the feeling of it was infectious. Before I knew it, I was laughing too.

As we laughed, I felt my heart lighten and my breath lift. Something in the air changed and for a moment, it felt like we were connected in a way that didn't need words.

Suddenly, I realized that laughter really was the shortest distance between two people. I could see that for Natalie and I, it was the quickest way to connect and make each other feel like we were part of something special.

From then on, whenever I was around Natalie, I made sure to bring laughter. Sometimes it was with a funny joke, or a funny story, but other times it was with a shared moment of silliness.

And no matter what, Natalie was always able to make me smile and make me laugh.

Laughter really is the best way to connect in relationships. It has no barriers, no egos, and no need for explanation. It creates an instantaneous connection unlike anything else. For Natalie and I, it was the way we built a strong and lasting bond.
