I was out for dinner with my best friend. We were both in a really bad and grumpy mood for some reason, so neither of us were really saying much. As we waited for the waiter to take our order, I noticed a tiny piece of broccoli had somehow slid off my plate and landed on the table. Without thinking, I said with a bit of frustration, “That damn piece of broccoli, it just won’t leave me alone!”

At that moment, my friend just started busting out laughing! It was so unexpected and contagious, I couldn’t help but join in. We both laughed until tears rolled down our cheeks. After a few minutes, the waiter returned with our order. He stood there looking uncomfortable until he finally said, “I guess laughter really is the best medicine.” 

My friend and I shared another laugh at that and the rest of our meal. Even though we didn’t know why we had both been so grumpy initially, that moment of laughter was a great reminder that we can still have fun in any situation.
