I recently encountered a difficult situation, but I learned a valuable lesson in patience. I was at the grocery store, and the clerk was having a very hard time with the customer in front of me. The customer was arguing with the clerk about something, and they were in a heated debate. It was an awkward situation standing there while they were arguing because I knew the clerk was just trying to do their job. 

I was getting a bit frustrated because of how long it was taking and how intrusive the customer was being to the clerk. But, I reminded myself to be patient and tried to distract myself by scrolling through my phone. I could tell the customer was starting to get angry and it felt like it was taking forever, but I didn't give in to my impatience. 

Finally, the customer seemed pleased with the outcome and walked away, and I was able to put my items on the counter to check out. After looking up, the clerk gave me a warm smile and thanked me for being patient throughout the whole ordeal. I was somewhat embarrassed but mostly flattered. I had the urge to apologize, but I knew it wasn't my fault, and I shouldn't have to apologize for something out of my control. 

That simple moment taught me an important lesson in patience. It helped me understand the concept of putting my own needs aside to help someone else. Even though there were no rewards or recognition for my patience, I still felt good about the way I handled the situation with the clerk and customer.
