I remember the first time my husband, Jack, and I laughed together. We had just started dating, and I was still a little nervous around him. We were walking around the park together, enjoying the late afternoon sunshine and taking in the tranquil surroundings.

As we walked, we talked about our interests and passions, sharing stories and getting lost in conversation. We were so wrapped up in our discussion that we didn't even notice the old woman who had been walking just ahead of us.

Suddenly, she turned around and addressed us both with a mischievous grin on her face.

"Let me give you two love birds a bit of advice," she said with a twinkle in her eye. "laughter is the key to a happy relationship. Without laughter, there can be no real love!"

Jack and I looked at each other and shared a moment of surprise and confusion. We had no idea what she was talking about. Then, quick as a flash, we both started to laugh. It was that kind of uninhibited un planned laughter that comes from people who are truly connecting with one another. We laughed until our sides hurt and tears ran down our temples. 

After our fit of laughter had passed, we once again made eye contact. And for the first time, we both knew -- with absolute surety -- that the two of us were meant to be together.
