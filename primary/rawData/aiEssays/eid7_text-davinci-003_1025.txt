I was at the mall to get myself a new outfit that I had been dying to get my hands on for weeks. I had my wallet in hand and was ready to purchase it but when I got to the counter there was a long line. I was about to turn around and begin to get frustrated when I noticed my friend further down the line, taking it all in stride. She kept talking to the people in line and was even cracking a few jokes. I watched her patiently standing in line and soon I found myself joining her in conversation. After 20 minutes of waiting, we had finally made it to the front of the line. From experience, I’ve learned that it’s often more rewarding to stay patient in situations like these.
