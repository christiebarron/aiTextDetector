Dear Editor, 

The age of computers and technology is upon us, and it's no wonder that people are debating the effects these advances have on our lives. As someone who has been personally affected by computers, I can speak from experience; I believe computers can have both positive and negative effects on people.

On the positive side, computers offer a vast amount of knowledge right at our fingertips. They make education more accessible, enabling people to study new topics, stay up-to-date on current events, and increase our overall knowledge. Computers also make it easier to stay connected with friends and family, as communication is now just a few clicks away. Additionally, computers can be used to improve our physical and mental health, such as playing video games and using apps to help track our mental and physical state. 

On the flip side, computers can be detrimental when it comes to the well-being of people. Too much time spent staring at a screen can lead to physical and mental health issues, such as obesity, eye strain, and mental fatigue. Additionally, the over-reliance of computers can lead people to become unaccustomed to problem-solving, as most issues can be easily solved by a few clicks.

Overall, I think it is important to keep in mind the positive and negative effects computers can have on people. It is important to understand them, so that we can use computers to their full potential and mitigate the downsides
