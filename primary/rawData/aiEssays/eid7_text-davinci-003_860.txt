One time, my sister's car broke down on the side of the road. We were worried since it was already dark outside. We waited for hours and finally my sister's friend showed up to help. He had his own tools and spare parts to get the car going again, but it was taking a while. Even though we were both tired and a bit frustrated, we were determined to get the car fixed.

My sister and I were amazed at our friend's patient attitude. He was so patient throughout the entire process and simply explained what he was doing without rushing. He went through all of the steps carefully and with a smile on his face. His patience was a real inspiration to us, and it reminded us to take the time to do things right. We finally got the car fixed and we were both deeply grateful to our friend for his help and patience.
