I was recently on a plane with my family, on our way back from a wonderful vacation. While we had a great time, the flight back was far from enjoyable. The plane was incredibly crowded and we were forced to separate; some of us in the middle row and others on the sides. We were all crammed in with hardly any room to move. 

Despite the tight space, my family remained patient. Rather than react negatively to the situation, we stayed understanding and tolerant. We looked out for each other, making sure everyone had enough room to be comfortable. Whenever someone stretched their legs, they would shift the luggage out of the way to give the other passengers some space. We would even joke with our fellow travelers, making an effort to stay light-hearted.

Even after such an uncomfortable experience, we managed to remain patient throughout the flight. We didn't let the tight space take away from our wonderful vacation. Instead, it made us appreciate the little things we can do for each other.
