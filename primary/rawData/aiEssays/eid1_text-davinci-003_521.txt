In today’s connected world, computers continue to be a major source of powerful tools, both for good and for bad. While it’s accepted that computers are highly effective and efficient, many worry about their far-reaching implications on the lives of individuals, especially when it comes to our physical and mental health.

As human beings, we’re hardwired to seek out others and build relationships with them, but in our current environment, computers are substituting for these relationships. People are increasingly turning to their phones and computers, as opposed to making real connections with family, friends, and neighbors. We’ve become so connected to our screens that we’re losing interest in the world around us.

When we make the shift away from face-to-face interaction and into “virtual living,” we open ourselves up to a host of physical and mental concerns. We become more prone to STDs, obesity, sleep deprivation, loneliness, and depression. We’re also less likely to pay attention to our environment, our fellow citizens, and to make conscious and healthy choices in life.

The use of computers is essential in a functioning society and its benefits are immense, but it’s important to stay alert to the dangers of becoming too dependent on them. It’s important to ensure we have the right balance between digital and social activities.
