I recently attended a family event with many of my relatives - some close and some not so close - and everyone was in high spirits. At one point, the conversation took a somewhat personal turn and I began to feel a bit uncomfortable. Everyone else seemed to be totally in their element, however, so I had to learn to be patient and bite my tongue. 

The situation lasted for a while and I wanted the conversation to come to an end. When it finally did, I felt an immense sense of relief yet I was also surprised at how patient I had stayed during the whole ordeal. After all, when it came to this particular moment, I had learned that patience is a virtue.
