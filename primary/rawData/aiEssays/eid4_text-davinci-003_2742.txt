‘Winter Hibiscus’ by Minfong Ho is a story about a girl’s challenging relationship with her father. Her father pressures her to achieve the perfect test result, while his expectations contrast with the joy and beauty of the winter hibiscus flower. The narrator’s decision to ‘take that test again’ when the flower ‘bud[s]’ serves as a metaphor for her determination to prove her worth and honour her father’s expectations. 

The narrator’s experience illustrates the constant battle between our pursuit of excellence and the presence of beauty in everyday life. As the narrator battles against her own failing grades, she recognises in the hibiscus the unattainable beauty of perfection. The hibiscus is a reminder of how life can be so beautiful yet driven by pressure; unbowed by a harsh winter, the flower’s optimism for a ‘spring’ speaks to a resilience in both her and her father’s hopes for her future. While a perfect grade may be temporary, beauty - as presented in the hibiscus - is a continuation of growth and improvement. 

The story’s conclusion serves as a testament to the narrator’s realisation that while her father’s expectations are significant and the test result serves as a reflection of her effort, there is beauty to be found in the present. The strength of the story lies in its ability to challenge us to find balance between striving for success and embracing the beauty of the moment. ‘Winter Hibisc
