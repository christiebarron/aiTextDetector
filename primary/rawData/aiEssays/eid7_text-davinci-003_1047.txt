I was recently in line at the grocery store, standing behind a woman with a full cart of groceries. She moved very slowly as she pulled her items from the cart and loaded them onto the conveyor belt, and as I glanced around I could tell that the other customers in line behind me were becoming increasingly impatient. I could feel myself wanting to rush her, but I willed myself to take a few deep breaths and be patient. Eventually she finished the transaction and I was able to step up and begin unloading my items. It took a great deal of effort to remain composed, but I was proud of myself for choosing to stay patient despite the long wait.
