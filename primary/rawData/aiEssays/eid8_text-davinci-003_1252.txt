 

I remember last Thanksgiving as if it were yesterday. Everyone had come together for dinner, and the atmosphere was thick with laughter and joy. My brother had started it all off by pointing out that my sister was wearing two different socks; one pink and one yellow. This made us all laugh until we had tears in our eyes.

Soon, our laughter softened and we settled into a more intimate conversation. We shared stories of our childhood, discussing all the funny moments we had shared and all the memories we had created. Every time someone brought up a funny story, we would all burst out in laughter again. The atmosphere was so filled with love and happiness that it was hard not to smile with them.

At some point in the evening, my dad started to tell a story about a time, when he was a child, that he had accidentally broken a dish of my grandmother's. As he told his story, he started to laugh until he couldn't speak anymore. Soon, everyone was laughing with him, happy that we all had such a funny memory to share.

The atmosphere slowly shifted to a less laughter-filled one but the atmosphere was still filled with love and joy. That Thanksgiving was a true testament to the power of laughter, and it is something I will never forget.
