The Empire State Building was built with the intention of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock atop its roof, an ambitious feat that had never been attempted before. Unfortunately, the builders of the landmark faced numerous obstacles in pursuing this goal. 

The most immediate challenge was the absence of any current technology to allow the airships to dock safely. In addition, the airships of the time were relatively unpredictable and relied heavily on the wind for their navigability. These facts posed a particular problem for the Empire State Building, as strong air currents and high winds are common in New York City. 

The construction of the building added to the challenge. Its frame was encased in limestone and covered with a flat, grated surface, which made it difficult to attach a mooring tool firmly and in a safe manner. Furthermore, the financial cost of building the mast was a major concern, as it would have to be of the highest quality to ensure the safety of those controlling the dirigibles. 

The building’s height also presented difficulties. A makeshift mast designed to suspend the airship, nicknamed “The Mooring Mast”, had to be built up the side of the building. This technology was so novel and dangerous that it was impossible to predict the safety of the mast before it was even tested.

Despite the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock, their ambition was ultimately successful. Having been outfitted with “The Mooring Mast” and other tools, the building proved able to safely dock the large
