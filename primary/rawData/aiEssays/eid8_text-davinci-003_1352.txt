It was the night of our first date, and I knew I was about to embark on an amazing journey. 

We exchanged pleasantries and there was a spark in his eyes every time he looked at me. We talked about anything that came to mind: our families, our likes and dislikes, our dreams for the future. Soon enough the conversation began to exhaust us, and we were starting to run out of things to talk about. 

Just as I thought the conversation had come to its end, he started to crack a joke about something insignificant. At first, I was taken aback as I wasn't expecting it, but soon, I erupted into a laughing fit. I wasn't sure if it was because of the joke he made or the fact that I'd finally let go of my nerves, but I couldn't help it â€” I was laughing uncontrollably. 

He caught the contagious vibes and soon he too was laughing along with me. The laughter was infectious, and it quickly filled the space between us. From that moment on, I felt a warmth come over me and I knew that we were both connected. 

That night, laughter was the bridge between us that made our first date unforgettable.
