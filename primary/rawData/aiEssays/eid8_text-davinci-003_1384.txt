I still remember the time when me and my cousin decided to go on a road trip together. We were excited and full of energy, making silly jokes and singing oldies from our childhood.

At one point during the drive, I had a particularly funny remark and we both ended up bursting into laughter. We laughed so hard the car started to rock back and forth, and neither of us could stop. We laughed until our sides hurt, and then we laughed some more.

It was one of those moments where nothing else mattered. We were in that moment, confused drivers passing by looking at us as if we were crazy, but all that mattered was that we were having a moment of ultimate joy. A moment that would stay with me forever.

It was one of those moments that just kind of reminds you of how important it is to share a laugh with someone you care about. No matter how silly it is, it always brings us closer together. I’m so glad that I’ve been able to share laughs with my cousin for all these years.
