The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 had a unique purposeâ€”allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. While this was an ambitious and innovative concept, it was not without its obstacles. The feat required extensive research, engineering, and inventive problem solving.

The first obstacle was determining the proper structure and design of the mooring mast. An aeronautical engineer named Antony Jannus was hired to design the mast, which would have to be able to withstand strong winds, steady airship traffic, and possible structural damage. His initial draft was a tall circle overlapping a series of four steel beams, but it quickly became clear that this design wouldn't work. Due to wind effects, the mast would sway and disrupt the airships.

The engineers eventually turn to a design with a system of two triangle-shaped frames, which were secured to a pair of main steel beams. This design provided a secure, stable foundation for the dirigible and was able to hold it in place despite strong winds.

The next obstacle was determining the best way to anchor the dirigible to the mast. Jannus came up with a scheme which involved two hooking systems: one for the mast and one for the dirigible itself. The mast's hooking system was made up of slotted steel plates, which could be hooked together to firmly secure the dirigible to the mast. For the dirigible, Jannus proposed a hook-and-eye setup, in which an eye hook was attached to the side of the dirigible and a hook was attached to the mast. When
