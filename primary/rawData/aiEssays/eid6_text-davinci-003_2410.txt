The people who were involved in building the iconic Empire State Building in New York City faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The "Mooring Mast" was the tallest steel structure made at the time and its sole purpose was to allow dirigibles, more commonly known as airships, to dock at the top of the building. 

The project was ambitious, to say the least. However, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were no small matter. The primary challenge was to design and construct a structure that could hold on to the much larger and heavier airship, which is no easy task. The design of the mooring mast was based around aerodynamic efficiency as the mast was essentially acting as an anchor for the airship, since the shifting winds could drag the mast and the attached aircraft in any direction.

In addition, the builders had to adhere to very strict safety and engineering standards to make sure that the structure would hold strong and never be put in a situation of stress or failure. To meet these safety requirements, the mast had to be fortified and built from high quality iron and stainless steel girders, and the foundation of the mast had to be reinforced with concrete. Furthermore, the mast itself must be covered in lightning conductors and other vital infrastructure to protect the passengers on board the aircraft.

In order to ensure the stability of the mooring mast, the builders had to take into account the environmental factors of the weather and the altitude of the structure. The air around the top of the Empire State Building was often much windier and colder than
