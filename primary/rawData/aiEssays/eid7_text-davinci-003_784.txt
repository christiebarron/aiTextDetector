I was at the grocery store the other day, waiting in line to check out, when a woman came to the front of the line and started arguing with the cashier about the price of some cereal. She was saying that it said it was on sale, and the cashier was telling her that the offer had expired. I knew that the cashier was right, but the woman refused to believe her and was getting louder and more angry.

I stayed calm and just watched what was going on. I could tell that the woman was getting more and more frustrated, but I didn't say anything. After the argument lasted for a few more minutes, the woman finally looked at me and asked why I hadn't said anything. I calmly told her that I wanted to be patient and understanding and that I believed the cashier was right. She was surprised, but she eventually accepted it and stopped arguing. She apologized to the cashier and then thanked me, and we were all able to move on with our day. 

I felt really proud of myself in that moment. Even though it took a lot of patience and self-control to remain calm, I was able to do it and it ended up de-escalating the whole situation. I was glad that I was patient and understanding, as it made a difficult situation a lot easier.
