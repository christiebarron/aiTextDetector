I was in a long line at the store recently. I had been standing there for about fifteen minutes, and the people in front of me had brought a lot of items that were all taking extra time to ring up. However, instead of getting antsy or angry, I simply waited patiently. I reminded myself it wasn't the cashier's fault and that it wasn't worth my time, energy, or stress to get frustrated over the situation. 

Suddenly, the person in front of me turned around and offered to let me go in front of them. I thanked them but quickly said that it was really no rush; that I was happy to wait my turn. The person smiled and thanked me for my patience. Afterwards, I was glad that I had chosen to be patient and understanding in the situation.
