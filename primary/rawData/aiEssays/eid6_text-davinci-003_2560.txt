The builders of the Empire State Building faced great obstacles in nurturing the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock. The vision of allowing large airships to moor at the Empire State Building required the sophistication of an innovative system to bring the intricate nuances to fruition. The notion of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a groundbreaking concept that had to be developed with extreme precision.

As described in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, achieving this feat of engineering required a suspension system that could keep the airship from swaying in the wind. The mast would need to rotate while being held steady by a few cables to guide the craft into its docking location. Furthermore, a secure girder structure was needed to be built that incorporated small guards along the top edge. It was these secure handrails that served an intricate purpose as to guide the craft towards the building by keeping the mooring cables in place at all times.

In order for the mast to safely accommodate the immense size of a dirigible to the Empire State building, the mast needed to be designed with a height that was greater than its width. Furthermore, the mast would need to incorporate a platform secured to the side of it so the dirigible could safely dock. Secured upon the platform would need to be a winch system to ensure the airship was securely held upon mooring.

The notion of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a dream that had to be navigated through numerous engineering challenges. To develop a system that would hold the immense size of an air
