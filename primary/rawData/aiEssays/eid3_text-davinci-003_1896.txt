The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski help underscore the cyclist's struggle and amplify the journey, making the story powerful and inspiring.

The mountainous terrain of the hills symbolizes obstacles to the cyclist, who must challenge his physical and mental strength to make it to the top. The "siege of the sky" serves as a metaphor for the cyclist taking on a seemingly never-ending, difficult path. The rising sun serves to bring life and clarity to the story as things become more accessible, both physically and mentally, for the cyclist.

The heat serves to challenge the cyclist, making the climb more difficult. The sweaty clothes and the pants that cling to his legs serve as a reminder of how the cyclist is pushing his limits. The roughness of the road presents an additional obstacle to the cyclist, as it can easily destabilize his bike. Ultimately, these features of the setting increase the stakes of the cyclist's journey and add a sense of peril to the story.

The cyclist is also motivated through features of the setting. The stunning landscape, the sound of the birds, and the renewed sense of freedom with the downhill runs, provide the cyclist with a sense of enjoyment
