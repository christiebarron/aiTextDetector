It was a routine Saturday night. My best friend and I had decided to skip our regular weekend plans and find something fun to do in town. We settled on seeing a movie at the theatre. As we settled into our seats, the preview for the upcoming movie started playing on the screen. It was an outrageous comedy. 

My best friend and I had the same thought at the same time: “This looks bad!” We couldn't help it - the preview was really funny in all the wrong ways. We started cracking up, and before we knew it both of us had laughing so hard our sides hurt. We were the only two people in the theatre who thought the preview was funny. 

The rest of the movie was pretty forgettable, and the plot felt thin and trite. But no matter how bad the movie was, my best friend and I still managed to laugh and joke the entire time. 

Laughter may not be the cure for every problem in the world, but it certainly felt like it on that night. It was the lightest I'd felt in a while, and it was just what I needed. That night was a reminder that even though life can be hard, laughter is always just around the corner to bring a smile to our faces.
