Dear Editor,

As technology advances, so does the presence and influence of computers in our lives. Many modern conveniences owe their existence to the computer, and this steady increase of computer usage has drastically changed how people interact with one another in their daily lives.

The surge of computers into our lives has created both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, computers have dramatically improved communication capabilities, both locally and globally. People can now stay in contact with almost anyone they know from across the world at the mere click of a mouse. The ability to have instant access to massive amounts of information has also been a huge benefit and educational tool for students and researchers.

On the other hand, heavy reliance on computers can have a negative effect on people, leading to social and psychological issues such as isolation and depression. Those who are using computers as a replacement for face-to-face communication risk alienating themselves from successful social and academic development. In addition, being exposed to more media outlets can have a negative effect on the minds and habits of our youth.

In conclusion, computers can have a great impact on both our society and individual lives, and, while they can be used as a tool in the right circumstances, they should be handled with great care and attention. The effects of computers can be either beneficial or detrimental depending on how they are used.

Sincerely,
[Name]
