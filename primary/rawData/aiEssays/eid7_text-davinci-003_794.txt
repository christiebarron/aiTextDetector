 

I remember the time my five-year-old daughter accidentally spilled a large cup of juice in the car. I knew it was an accident and instead of getting angry, I stayed patient with her. I quickly found napkins to clean up the mess and explained to her what we needed to do to make the car clean again. We worked together to clean up the juice and I even managed to keep my cool and not get frustrated in the process. I think my daughter really appreciated my patience, as she kept thanking me and apologizing throughout the process. In the end, she felt much better knowing that I wasnâ€™t mad at her, and that I had understood it was an accident. That moment taught me the importance of staying patient and moving past any difficult moments we might encounter.
