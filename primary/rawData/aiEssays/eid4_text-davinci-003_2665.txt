The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem, “Winter Hibiscus” is important in understanding the poem’s central theme: resilience. The poem’s protagonist speaks of adversity coming with the winter. Despite the difficult times, her aunt was able to bring home winter hibiscus, which in spite of the cold remained alive and “thrived in its winter coat.” The poem’s conclusion suggests the protagonist’s resilience, as she reflects on the importance of the hibiscus, in reference to an “impossible” test. 

The resilience displayed in “Winter Hibiscus” is not just that of the hibiscus, but of the protagonist as well. By taking the time to truly appreciate the hibiscus, she is envisioning that when difficult times come again, she too will be able to find strength within and thrive. The fact that the protagonist makes this connection implies that there’s a larger point being made. In the same way that the hibiscus can survive the cold winter and still bloom in the spring, the protagonist promises to take the test again “when the snows melt and the geese return,” with new strength. 

The “impossible” test referenced in the poem may in fact symbolize any challenge an individual has faced in life. When faced with difficult times, whether it’s an educational test, adversity at work, or a personal challenge, looking at the hibiscus can act as a reminder
