To the Editor:

With the advancements in technology, computers have become a staple of everyday life. And while computers are widely accepted as tools that can help with education, communication, research and information, their effects on people should not be underestimated. 

The frequent use of computers has been linked to a range of physical and psychological problems. People can become addicted to the Internet and computers, leading to obesity, carpal tunnel syndrome, eyestrain and emotional disorders. Computers also have an effect on our social lives, with people preferring to stay indoors and interact through social media instead of meeting in person.

The convenience of computers has us all relying on them for our day-to-day tasks. However, this reliance can come at a cost. It has been found that overusing computers can lead to depression, anxiety, and even mental breakdowns. 

It's important for people to be aware of the risks associated with using computers too much. We need to take responsibility for our own use and make sure to balance our time spent online and in the real world. We should also take steps to remind ourselves and our friends and family members of the importance of taking regular computing breaks. 

This is an important issue that must be addressed by everyone. We all need to be mindful of how computers are affecting our daily lives in order to prevent any further harm to our physical and mental wellbeing.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
