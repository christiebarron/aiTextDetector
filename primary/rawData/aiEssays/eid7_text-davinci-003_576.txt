 

I was in line at the grocery store the other day, when a very impatient woman got in line in front of me. She was obviously in a hurry, and was constantly tapping her foot and looking at her watch. I felt the urge to scold her for the lack of patience, but I decided to just remain silent and be patient. 

The woman ahead of me in line was rummaging through her purse, trying to find her wallet, but it wasn't easy. Not to mention, the cashier was having a slow day and was really taking her time ringing the people up. 

All throughout the situation, I remained patient and understanding. I was probably the only one standing in line who didn't make a negative comment about the slow cashier. Once it was my turn to check out, I waved goodbye to the woman ahead of me, wishing her a nice day. 

Being patient in this situation was definitely the right thing to do. Practicing patience on a daily basis is important, especially when it comes to getting through difficult times.
