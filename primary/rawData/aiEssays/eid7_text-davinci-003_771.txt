I recently was in line at a grocery store and noticed the person in front of me struggling to pay. They were counting out the correct change and had a seemingly infinite amount of pennies and nickels. I could tell they were embarrassed and I tapped their shoulder with a smile and told them they could take their time. They thanked me and continued counting coins. I didnâ€™t mind the wait and I just kept smiling at them and talking kindly as they went along. After what felt like an eternity they finished counting and received their change. As they headed out of the line I thanked them for taking the time needed to pay. I hope I was able to make them feel less embarrassed about their situation and that my patience was a help to them.
