The Empire State Building was designed to accommodate dirigible docking as part of its plan, but the builders faced many obstacles to make it a reality. The main challenge was the structure's height. At 1,872 feet tall, the building posed a risk for airships due to its strong air currents, which posed a danger to the delicate airships.

In addition, the Empire State Building was located in the middle of Manhattan, surrounded by other tall structures. This meant that a dirigible wanting to dock would have to navigate through a surprise of tall buildings, creating an even greater danger of disturbed air currents at the building's docking site.

The next obstacle to making dirigible docking a reality was the wind speed at the Empire State Building. As an extremely tall structure, it was more susceptible to gusts of wind compared to airships, which could find a safer, more sheltered docking spot. Furthermore, the fact that the building was located in such a populous city meant that there was greater air pollution and the danger of engine failure for airships. 

Finally, the location posed its own set of challenges. Similar to other tall buildings in the area, the issue of navigating surrounding structures was present. Additionally, the Empire State Building's docking site was located 4,100 feet from the closest airport runway and propeller-driven aircraft were expected to take off in those areas. This meant that the winds created by the planeâ€™s propellers would likely create strong air currents that could potentially disturb an airship's mooring mast when it attempted to dock.

In order to achieve its goal of
