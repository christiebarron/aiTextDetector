I was out with my best friend for dinner and we had just been served our food when we heard a baby crying in the distance. We looked around but couldn't figure out where the baby was and then suddenly we both burst out laughing as we realized it was actually my best friend's phone in her handbag, she had forgotten to put it on silent! We laughed so hard we were nearly in tears and, from then on, every time one of us uses their phone, the other one starts laughing hysterically at the memories of the mischievous crying baby. 

We always joke that it's the baby that holds our friendship together, and it's what reminds us of the good times that we share.
