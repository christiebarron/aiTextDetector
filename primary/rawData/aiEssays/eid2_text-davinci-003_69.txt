Dear Editor:

Many libraries across the country have undertaken a censorship of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. A common argument in favor of censorship is that books, music, movies, and magazines may contain offensive content which could be damaging to young viewers. While I am a firm believer that certain materials should not be available to young viewers, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries and that adults should be trusted to make the decision of what they and their children read, watch, and listen to. 

First and foremost, public libraries are a source of free and open knowledge. Censoring materials removes this freedom of access and can create a sense of “forbidden knowledge” for those who are looking for it. By introducing censorship into the library, we are instilling the notion that certain materials should not be explored and thus removing the power of choice and curiosity from adults. Furthermore, censorship in libraries can reinforce aversion towards certain topics, which can lead to further prejudice and isolation among those seeking knowledge. 

Censorship in libraries can also stifle creativity. By removing certain materials due to their content, those creating such materials may be discouraged and inhibited from innovating and exploring new works. This effect is especially detrimental in an era where freedom of expression is even more important and where young adults are learning to express themselves through creative means. 

Ultimately, adults have the right to choose what materials they and their children consume, and public libraries should remain a place of open access to all kinds of information. Libraries should not be used to censor materials, instead
