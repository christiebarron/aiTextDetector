I am a teacher, and one of my students was having a difficult time learning a certain concept. She was becoming frustrated, and it was causing her anxiety about her upcoming exam.

I could tell that she was stressed, so I took the time to just talk with her and patiently explain the concept. I could tell that she was still a bit confused, so I asked her to talk through the problem with me and explain her thought process so that I could better understand how she was thinking about it. 

I listened carefully and asked guiding questions to help her really think about the problem. After about 15 minutes of conversation, she finally started to grasp the idea, and her anxiety and frustration had disappeared. 

Seeing her progress and the relief on her face was extremely rewarding as a teacher. I knew that she felt respected and supported, and it reminded me of why I chose to teach in the first place.
