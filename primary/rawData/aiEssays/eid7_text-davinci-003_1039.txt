I'm a teacher, and had a student whose performance in my class was really suffering. His grades were slipping, and it was clear he was having difficulty in other areas as well. While I knew I needed to intervene and have a serious discussion with him, I took the time and care to get to know him and gain his trust first.

It wasn't easy. He was withdrawn, spoke little, and had built intense barriers between us. When I asked him to stay after class, he was visibly anxious and I could tell he was concerned about what I was going to say.

But I was patient. I talked with him for an hour, and he slowly opened up about his personal struggles and how they were affecting his school performance. By the end of the conversation, he had visibly relaxed, was expressing himself more fully, and was beginning to think about ways to work through the issues he was facing.

I can't stress enough how important it was that I was patient with him. I listened and asked him questions instead of rushing to judgment, and it made all the difference. He responded in kind and trust had been built, which is essential if one wants to really help someone grow and succeed.
