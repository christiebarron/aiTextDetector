In todayâ€™s world of technological advances and access to limitless amounts of information, censorship in public libraries has become a contentious issue. On one hand, public libraries are funded by taxpayers, making it a civic responsibility to provide a selection of books and materials to all members of the community, regardless of their personal beliefs or opinions. On the other hand, members of the public can be exposed to materials deemed offensive or inappropriate.

Public libraries should not censor books, movies, music, or magazines. While some may believe these materials should be removed from the shelves, doing so would prevent individuals from making their own decisions on what they choose to read or listen to. It is important for public libraries to continue to provide the right of freedom of expression, which is an inalienable right guaranteed by the United States Constitution. 

Censorship can have a negative impact on the quality of public discourse and undermine public dialogue, which is essential for the development of a well-informed society. By depriving individuals from the opportunity to make their own decisions on what they choose to consume, censorship of library materials can be limiting the ability to discuss and explore new ideas.

Because of this, public libraries should continue to provide open access to a variety of materials, while still abiding by their civic responsibility to provide materials that are appropriate and accurate. This can be done through careful selection of materials and providing access to different kinds of resources and outreach services. Public libraries should also implement policies that give patrons the right to choose their own materials, while maintaining a healthy dialogue and shared knowledge base in the community.
