I recently had a chance to witness patience in action. My mother, who is a nurse, had recently moved to a new city. With her new job, she was busy, and it was difficult for her to adjust.

One day, while I was visiting, I noticed that she was struggling to put together a new bookshelf that she had bought. She was trying her best, but the instructions were difficult to understand, and she was having a hard time getting all of the pieces together correctly.

At first, I offered to help, but she smiled and said, "No, I'm okay. I'm sure I'll figure it out soon." She then gave me a hug and added, "Patience is a virtue. I'll get it eventually."

I watched as she took her time, going over the instructions, re-reading them several times, and trying her best to match the pieces up. After what seemed like hours, the bookshelf was finally finished. She took a step back and smiled, clearly feeling a sense of pride.

I was so proud of her for showing such patience and determination. It's a quality she exemplifies in so many areas of her life, and a quality I strive to embody, too.
