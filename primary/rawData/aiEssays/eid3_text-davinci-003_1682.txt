In Joe Kurmaski’s poem “Rough Road Ahead”, the speaker is a cyclist traveling a winding road with many challenges ahead. The features of the setting have a significant impact on the experience of the cyclist.

The most immediate of these features is the physical terrain of the road. The speaker makes mention of “bumps and curves that rock my spine”, as well as “rocky paths carved out of granite”. These features create a challenge for the cyclist both physically and mentally. The physical exertion of navigating the bumps and curves of the road make the journey difficult, exhausting, and rewarding. On the mental side, the speaker must stay focused and in the moment, preparing for each obstacle they come across.

The environment of the poem also affects the cyclist. The narrator passes “a cool misty spray that splashes off” and “glistening curbsides”. The cool mist reminds the cyclist of the challenge ahead, and the shimmer on the street pulses with energy. The environment infuses the journey with a feeling of hope and excitement.
