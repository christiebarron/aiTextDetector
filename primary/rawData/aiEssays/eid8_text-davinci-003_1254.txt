I felt an instant connection with the attractive girl sitting across from me. We had been chatting for a few hours and I was feeling more and more at ease around her. Suddenly, I noticed a smile spreading across her face and I knew she had noticed something funny.

I am always up for a good laugh, so I asked her what had her amused so much. She pointed to a couple of kids playing across the room who were in the middle of an argument. As she told me what the kids were arguing about, I couldn't help but start to laugh. 

Before I knew it, we were both laughing and it felt like we had known each other for much longer than we actually had. In that moment, it felt like all of the anxieties that one experiences when meeting someone for the first time melted away. 

The connection we had felt was real, and it was ignited by a simple laugh.
