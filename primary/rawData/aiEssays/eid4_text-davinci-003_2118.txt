Minfong Ho's award-winning poem "Winter Hibiscus" tells the story of a young girl, Mei-li, struggling with the pressures of growing up and facing the expectations of her community. Inspired by her ancestor's stories about a special hibiscus that flourished in the cold winters of their homeland, the poem culminates in Mei-li's plan to take a test that will determine her future.

At the end of the poem, Ho stunningly concludes with the line “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This poignant image brings together the earlier references to Mei-li's ancestral home, a hibiscus that scarcely survives the winter, and the idea of a future of unimaginable possibilities.
