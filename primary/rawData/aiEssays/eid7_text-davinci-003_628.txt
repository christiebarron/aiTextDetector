I remember walking into my grandmother's kitchen one summer morning to the smell of biscuits baking in the oven. She was in the middle of making breakfast for all of us, my entire extended family, who would be arriving later that day. I noticed she was struggling to evenly distribute the batter into all the muffin liners. She was frustrated but determined to get it just right.

I could tell she wanted to give up but was determined to make this perfect. I felt the urge to step in and take over but I held my tongue knowing this was important to her and stood back and watched as she carefully filled each cup with the same amount of batter. I was amazed and inspired by her patience, even in the midst of frustration and difficulty. 

After a few minutes of hard work, she was satisfied and smiled when she saw the result. It was a beautiful sight and I was proud of her! I knew then that I wanted to learn to be just as patient and resilient, no matter how difficult the task at hand.
