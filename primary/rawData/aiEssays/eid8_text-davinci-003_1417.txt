I remember the first time I ever shared laughter with someone. I was in 8th grade and had just moved to a new city. I was feeling a little unsure in my new surroundings and quite lonely. 

One day, I was walking down the school hallway when I heard a loud roar of laughter coming from one of the classrooms. I stepped inside the door, and immediately felt like I belonged. Everyone was sitting in a semi-circle around a girl, who was telling a joke. She had a beautiful, infectious laugh, and soon everybody in the room was laughing too. 

I couldn’t help but chuckle along with all of them. I felt my loneliness drift away, like a cloud had passed over me, and I was no longer an outsider in this new place. 

From then on, I joined in on the fun, laughing and telling jokes just like everyone else. For the first time, I felt like I had a place to belong.

Looking back, it’s still one of the happiest memories of my teenage years. It was in that moment, surrounded by laughter, that I knew I would be OK in my new city.
