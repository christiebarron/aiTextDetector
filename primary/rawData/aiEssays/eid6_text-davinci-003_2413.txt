The development of the iconic Empire State Building included enabling dirigibles, or large airships, to dock atop the skyscraper. Despite the immense technical and engineering progress the feat required, the true challenge was one posed to the builders’ ingenuity--the socio-political obstacle of convincing all of the necessary stakeholders that such a novel idea was feasible, and more importantly, worth the risks. 

The risks, it must be noted, were plenty. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast makes clear, the key challenge was to make sure the Empire State Building could support the airship. It would need to remain balanced and level, even with the pull of a large airship’s weight, to ensure the mooring mast remained in the correct position. Issues of wind and weather, as well as the technical task of installing the powerful beacon and radio beacon on the top of the building, needed to be taken into consideration. The need to protect pedestrians and other bystanders from the risks posed by a large airship docking—not to mention the concerns of airmen and dirigible pilots of the effect of exhaust from the airships’ engines—needed thoughtful solutions, and all of the solutions needed approval from the Department of War. 

In the end, a successful test mooring was conducted in 1931, during the era of the Great Depression and the rise of American streamlined design. This striking visual of an airship docked atop an iconic skyscraper helped the builders of the Empire State Building demonstrate to all of the stakeholders that the prospect of a successful mooring
