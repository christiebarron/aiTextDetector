In the 1930s, the architects of the Empire State Building were forward-thinking in realizing that one day dirigibles, or airships, would provide an important means of passenger transportation. To this end, they designed the Empire State Building with the capability of docking these new sky-high vessels. Despite their modern vision and foresight, the architects of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The primary challenge was finding a secure and reliable way to attach the airship to the building and moor them safely. At the time of construction, no such system was in place. In order to facilitate mooring, they designed a retractable steel mast, called the mooring mast, with interlocking steel rings built into the wall. With the mooring mast in place and a new system of grappling hooks connecting the airship to the rings, it was then possible to attach the dirigible securely.

The architects and engineers also had to design the mooring mast with the unique air and wind patterns of New York City in mind. Depending on the height of the airship, the mooring mast needed to be positioned at various heights to account for the changing wind speeds due to the city's strong air currents. Additionally, the winds were often very strong, so the mooring mast needed to be able to withstand these powerful gusts.

In addition to the engineering obstacles, there were financial concerns as well. The mooring mast was a costly endeavor and the planners had to ensure that the mast was within their budget. Furthermore, the
