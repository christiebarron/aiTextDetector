The building of the Empire State Building in New York City was a major architectural feat of its time. However, its construction presented unique challenges to its builders, the primary one being how to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. These lighter-than-air vessels, while novel and exciting, posed a risk to the structure due to the added weight and stress they would put on the building.

The first obstacle was finding a suitable place to install the necessary mooring mast. This feat was accomplished by building a fifty-five foot steel tower with a single cross beam, which was then riveted to the roof of the Empire State Building. The next step was to design a way for dirigibles to drop a mooring cable and attach the ship to the mast. A massive counterweight was engineered, allowing the cable to be released and retracted from the ground, allowing the dirigible to ascend or descend. 

In addition to the structural issues, there were also safety and liability concerns. As Marcia Aminon Lüsted notes in her article “The Mooring Mast,” the Empire State Building had to implement stringent regulations and safety protocols in order to ensure the dirigibles’ safe passage. Flight plans and licenses had to be approved, and passengers had to be screened carefully before boarding. The dirigible pilots undertook extraordinary measures to ensure the safety of those on board, such as scanning the area carefully before departure, and keeping the vessel at a safe altitude and speed. 

Finally, the limited capacity of the mooring mast and the unpredictable weather conditions in New York City further
