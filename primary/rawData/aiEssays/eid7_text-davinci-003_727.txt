I recently encountered a situation that tested my ability to be patient. I was out to dinner with friends and had been waiting for our food for over an hour. I was starting to notice my friends getting frustrated, ready to make a scene and leave without our food.
However, I decided to take a different approach and think positively. I thought to myself, "This must be a really busy night for the restaurant. They're doing their best and my patience will be rewarded with a great meal." 
To keep my friends calm and happy, I joked around with them, talked about various topics, and shared funny stories. Eventually, our food arrived and it was every bit as amazing as we had expected it to be. Everyone was satisfied and grateful that I had been patient enough to wait and diffuse the situation.
