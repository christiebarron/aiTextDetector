The builders of the Empire State Building faced the difficult obstacle of figuring out how to allow dirigibles to dock with the skyscraper. When the building opened in 1931, the plan was to utilize a “mooring mast,” a tall pole affixed to the top of the structure that would serve as an anchor for dirigibles in the sky. Despite being an ambitious project given both the technical and financial challenges, the developers of the building were determined to make the concept come to fruition.

The “Mooring Mast” concept was presented in a paper by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), with author Marcia Amidon Lüsted noting that “the desire to make air travel easier, safer, and faster drove the idea.” The ALPA envisioned that dirigibles would be mooring at the mast on a daily basis and would serve as a “convenient link between the skyscraper and points all over the world.” Despite the potential for success, the dream was difficult to make a reality due to the technical engineering challenges.

Those involved with the project were tasked with figuring out the structural integrity of the mast, how a large enough anchor point could be attached, and the issue of air turbulence around the building once a dirigible was moored. Additionally, a variety of safety issues had to be thought out, such as the potential for a gust of wind to damage the cables connecting dirigibles to the mast. 

Despite the numerous challenges, the engineers behind the project pressed on and made the mooring mast idea
