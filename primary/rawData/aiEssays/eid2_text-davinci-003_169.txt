In today's world, the presence of censorship in libraries is an issue of grave importance. Libraries should keep the freedom of information and expression alive, while at the same time protecting the rights and sensitivities of readers. The debate surrounding censorship in libraries is one that should be approached with the utmost care and delicacy. 

Censorship in libraries can be a double-edged sword. Books, music, movies, and magazines are a source of education and entertainment, and offer a wealth of knowledge, particularly for those areas of society which lack resources or access to culture. At the same time, books, music and other printed materials can contain articles or images of a sensitive nature that might be seen as offensive to a certain group of people.

That being said, there needs to be a delicate balance between the freedom to access information and the protection of the public's sensitivities. Libraries should keep the freedom of information and expression alive, but should also be aware of, and take into account the cultural and ethnic sensitivities of the community they serve. Libraries should be alert to the presence of publications and materials that could be seen as offensive or harmful to certain sections of the population, and they should be extra vigilant in making sure that such materials are removed from their shelves. 

Overall, materials should not be removed from library shelves solely on the basis of them being perceived as offensive or harmful. Careful consideration should be taken to make sure that intellectual freedom is not infringed upon, while at the same time upholding the rights and sensitivities of the community.
