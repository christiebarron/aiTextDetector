I was on my way to my friend's house for dinner and I had to walk through a busy street filled with people. As I was walking, I noticed two people who were walking the same direction as me and they were laughing. 

I couldn't help but smile at the sound of their laughter and it made me think back to my own friendship. In that moment, I remembered little things that my friend and I used to do together. We would often giggle and laugh at silly jokes or just poke fun at each other.

That made me realize just how important laughter is in any relationship. It doesn't matter what hardships you have been through, laughter will always be a way to connect with one another. 

The sound of those strangers laughter put a huge smile on my face and reminded me of my own special friendship. It was a reminder that even in the calm times, laughter is always present.
