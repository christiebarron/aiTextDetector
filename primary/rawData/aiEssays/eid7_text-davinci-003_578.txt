I had a friend once who taught me an important lesson about patience. We were running late for an appointment and our train was delayed for an hour. Usually I'd get really frustrated with this kind of situation, but my friend stayed calm and collected. He simply accepted things for what they were and kept a positive attitude.

He kept me grounded when I was about to lose my temper. He reminded me that getting angry and shouting at the people running the trains wasn't going to make them start running on time. Instead, he suggested we make the most of the situation and grab a bite to eat while we wait. His patience and level-headedness eventually paid off when the train finally arrived and we only ended up a few minutes late.

This experience showed me the value of being patient and composed. I found that when faced with a difficult situation, there is nothing to be gained from getting angry and frustrated. Keeping a cool head and having a patient outlook can help to navigate these kinds of situations, and often reap better outcomes.
