I remember when I was younger, my dad and I used to play a game called 'Hide and Seek' every evening after dinner. It was always a blast - we would search around the house for each other, waiting to see who could find the other first. One time, I managed to find his hiding place in the garage behind an old bicycle, but instead of assuming his usual stance which him would instantly break out into a fit of laughter. I was surprised, and couldn't help but laugh as well. We both ended up laughing so hard that he eventually fell over, with me still giggling beside him.

That night, I felt a stronger understanding between us than ever before. I knew then that laughter is genuinely the shortest distance between two people. To this day, whether it's with my dad or anyone else, I still believe that laughter can bring people together in the toughest of times.
