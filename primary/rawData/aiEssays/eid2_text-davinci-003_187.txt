The issue of censorship in libraries is one that has been hotly debated for years. From the banning of books like "Huckleberry Finn" to the ratings on movies, censorship in libraries is a controversial issue. My stance is that there is no place for censorship in libraries.

Books, music, movies, and magazines are all forms of expression. People should be allowed to read, listen to, and watch whatever choice of material they prefer without interference from others. Censorship does not allow for this freedom of expression to occur and is a threat to the first amendment.

Furthermore, censorship in libraries is not only ineffective, it is also counter intuitive. Removing a book from the shelf does not guarantee that it will never be seen. If a person is determined to find a book, movie, or other material that is censored, they will find a way. Censorship doesn't stop those with the intent to view objectionable material; it only makes it more difficult to find.

Censorship of libraries is also a form of moral policing. It is the job of the librarians to offer the materials and resources to the patrons and allow them to make their own decisions. It isn't their place to exercise their own beliefs or opinions on what is right or wrong.

Finally, everyone has the right to access information that they feel is important to them. Restricting access to certain materials limits the collection of knowledge and resources at our disposal. This could have far reaching consequences, particularly in the fields of science, medicine, and education.

For these reasons, censorship does not have its place
