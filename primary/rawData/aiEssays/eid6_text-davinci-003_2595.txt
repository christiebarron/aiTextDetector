The construction of the Empire State Building in 1930 represented the height of modern engineering, with an impressive 102 stories of steel frame and masonry rising up from the bustling streets of New York City. This iconic skyscraper was one of the first structures to be built to accommodate the arrival of rigid airships, or dirigibles. The logistics of this undertaking were immense and posed a number of unforeseen obstacles for its builders.

The first difficulty presented itself in terms of engineering: the building had to be tall enough for the dirigible to float above the surrounding structures and yet close enough for it to moor to a platform. To address this issue, the engineers first proposed the installation of a 500-foot steel tower on the roof to act as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. This solution was eventually scrapped due to the prohibitive costs and the potential hazards it posed to the stability of the frame.

In response, they came up with the idea to attach a “fingers” system to the rooftop that could act as an anchoring platform for the dirigible. This system was composed of four steel beams reaching out from the edge of the building, with a base in the centre supporting the airship’s mooring ropes. However, while the “fingers” may have seemed like a straightforward solution to the problem, its execution was far more complicated. The builders had to consider the physical weight and static forces that the dirigible and its ropes would exert on the steel beams as it docked. In addition, the builders had to fortify the existing external supports of the
