I remember one time when my best friend and I went out to dinner at a local restaurant. It was one of our “date nights” - a night where we just got out of the house, did something new, and talked about everything and anything. 

When we were finishing our meal, my best friend made a silly joke and it suddenly struck me that no matter how long we’d been friends, or how many years have gone by, we still made each other laugh. 

I started chuckling, but the more I thought about it, the funnier it became. Pretty soon I was in tears – I was laughing so hard I was bent over at the table, and wiping away tears between laughs. Even the waitstaff at the restaurant noticed us, and soon some of them started laughing too.

My best friend and I spent the whole rest of the night talking about jokes we’d heard, and experiences we’d gone through together. It was a reminder to me how important laughter is in any relationship. 

No matter what life throws your way, or how much time goes by, laughter will always remain the shortest distance between two people.
