My best friend, Josh, and I had been friends since we were in high school. We had always been close, and could always make each other laugh no matter the situation.

One day, while walking to lunch, we passed by a store that had recently opened that was selling all kinds of funny gag gifts. We were so tempted to go in, but we kept on going because we were already running late. 

Finally, we got to the restaurant and sat down. We were both so starving that we quickly began to order our food. We were so busy talking about our plans for the weekend that we didn't even notice the waiter had left the table. 

But then something hilarious happened. Our waiter had accidentally forgotten our order! He had totally forgotten to write it down and was so embarrassed. He apologized profusely to us and we couldn't help but start laughing. 

Even though we were a bit aggravated at the time, it was so funny that we couldn't help but laugh. It felt like a huge weight off our shoulders. Our waiter was so embarrassed but in the end, he was very kind and gave us a free dessert! 

To this day, we still laugh about that day and it never fails to put a smile on our faces. Laughter really is the best medicine.
