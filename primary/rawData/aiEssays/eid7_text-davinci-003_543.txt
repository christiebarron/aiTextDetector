I was recently waiting in line at the store for what felt like an eternity. I was starting to get a bit frustrated, when I noticed the person in front of me was an elderly woman who was having some trouble. She was fidgeting with her wallet, dropping coins and cards, and stumbling through her words when trying to talk to the cashier. 

Rather than get angry and impatient, I decided to remain patient and understanding. I knew that she was probably dealing with something that was out of her control, so I decided to take a deep breath, relax, and wait. 

Eventually, she was all set and I was next to be served. I smiled at her and told her to have a good day. I felt quite proud of myself for being patient and understanding in a situation that could have easily been upsetting.
