The absence of bike lanes, sidewalks and stop lights forces the cyclist to take extra precautions and be aware at all times. 

Not only does the small town force the cyclist to be more cautious, but Kurmaski also uses the setting to highlight the presence of other vehicles on the roads. The cyclist has to watch out for vehicles that are potentially fast and unpredictable, meaning they have to take extra measures to remain safe and be aware of their surroundings. The presence of semi-trucks, for example, makes for a particularly treacherous ride, as it limits the cyclist’s sight of the road and blocks the path of other vehicles.
