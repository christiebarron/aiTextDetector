At the end of ‘Winter Hibiscus’ by Minfong Ho, the protagonist appears to have failed a test, but by the time the poem ends they have not accepted defeat, but rather found a new source of hope: the prospect of taking the test again when the season changes. This line serves to demonstrate the ephemeral nature of disappointment, and the characters’ resilience and determination in the face of adversity.

The winter hibiscus serves as a metaphor for the protagonist’s determination to succeed in spite of the difficult circumstances they are facing. Despite being surrounded by winter—in an environment that seems to be lacking in growth, energy or opportunity—the hibiscus persists and is unaffected by the frigid temperatures, representing the character's inner strength and resilience. Similarly, the geese’s return to their seasonal migration path serves as a symbol of the protagonist’s unwavering commitment to the journey of learning, improvement and eventual success.

The poem is a reminder that, in a figurative sense, the winter will eventually pass. While it may be tempting to shut out opportunities and give up on something in which we’ve invested time and effort, this is not an option if we are to better ourselves and achieve our goals. As the protagonist resolves to take the test again in the spring, they demonstrate the importance of persisting even in the face of obstacles and failures.

The protagonist is a beacon of hope to the reader, reminding them of the power of determination and the potential of progress, even when the situation appears bleak. ‘
