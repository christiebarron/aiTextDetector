Dear Editor, 

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is no secret that computers have become a significant part of our lives, forming such an integral part of almost everything we do. While computers can definitely be extremely useful, there are many ways in which they can have an adverse effect on society. 

The growing amount of time people spend staring at a computer screen can cause an increased risk of eye strain and health problems, as well as a decrease in personal social interactions. Computers can also be used to exploit children or adults by different forms of cyberbullying. Moreover, it encourages people to develop a reliance on technology, so that they cannot think outside of what they can do by using the computer.

Nevertheless, the effects computers have can vary, as they can be used as an essential tool to facilitate everyday tasks, like banking and shopping, as well as communication and entertainment. In addition, computers can be used in educational contexts to build problem-solving and critical thinking skills. 

In conclusion, I believe that computers can have both positive and negative effects on people, depending on how they are used. Proper regulation of the use of computers to ensure that people stay safe from harm and keep them engaged in meaningful activities is important.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
