Minfong Ho's poem "Winter Hibiscus" ends with a haunting yet beautiful thought, that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then the speaker will take the test again. This imagery of a hibiscus-filled winter gives the poem an ethereal feel, as if the speaker is taking solace in the cyclical nature of life- that as the hibiscus freezes and dies off in the winter, it will return in the spring, more beautiful and vibrant than ever before. This teaches us a lesson of staying strong even in the difficult times, and never giving up, as the difficult times will soon pass and the warmer times will return once again.

The poem gives us the message of hope in the midst of difficult times, showing us that the cold winter that we're going through is part of life, and as the hibiscus will emerge in the spring, so too will our lives have a fresh start too. The poem is also a reminder to not just sit still and wait out the cold times, but to toil and work hard during these moments, so that when the spring returns, we can flourish and bloom like the hibiscus. The imagery of the hibiscus blossoming when the winter concludes shows us a bright future, one that is full of potential and opportunity waiting to be taken.

Therefore, Minfong Ho's "Winter Hibiscus" is a beautiful reminder that no matter how difficult of a season we may be going through, there is always a light at the end of
