Dear Editor, 
 
I recently read an article analyzing the positive and negative influences of computers on people. After consideration, I strongly believe that computers have both a positive and negative impact on our lives, and that their impact should be balanced. 

On the one hand, computers give us access to vast amounts of information, which is a plus. This means that people can now stay more informed and globally aware. High-speed internet allows students to research topics of study faster, while businesses can reach clients more efficiently. Furthermore, computers enable us to connect with a network of people around the world and make communication easier. 

However, the availability of the internet can be a double-edged sword. For instance, too much time spent online can lead to decreased physical activity, unsuccessful studies, and lack of long-term memory retention due to continual distraction. Also, excessive online use can cause people to become overly reliant on technology, leading to a decreased ability to work without a computer.

The key to limiting negative effects of computers on people is for each individual to assess the time spent using them each day. Taking regular breaks from using computers, focusing on physical activities and prioritizing offline relationships is essential. That way, the positive benefits of technology can be maintained while the negative effects are kept to an acceptable level.

I hope readers take my opinion into account and understand how an appropriate balance of technology in our lives will be beneficial.
