Dear Editor,

I believe that computers have had a major effect on people in all aspects of society worldwide. Nowadays, computers are being used in almost every industry and have become an integral part of our daily lives.

As computers have become more advanced over the years, the way in which we interact with the world around us has changed significantly. With the advances in technology, more time is being spent on computers and the internet, which has had many positive effects. People are able to access knowledge that would have been difficult to find in the past and can now stay in contact with friends or family around the world. Computers have also improved communication by providing users with instant access to news and information.

On the other hand, there has been criticism over how computers have changed the way people interact with others. It is argued that computer usage has had a damaging effect on human relationships. However, I do not think that this is the case. Computers actually provide users with a wide range of opportunities to speak with people, form support networks, or even find new friends.

In my opinion, the effects of computers on people have been overwhelmingly positive. They have created a world full of knowledge and opportunities that can be accessed at the touch of a button. For this reason, I believe that computers have enhanced all aspects of our lives and should be embraced with open arms. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
