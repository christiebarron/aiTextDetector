The other day I was visiting my parents, and we were all sitting around the table discussing how crazy it is that the summer is almost over. We were all in a sort of melancholy mood and the conversation had started to die down. All of a sudden my mom starts to laugh out loud and I got caught up in it too. We almost couldn't stop ourselves, especially as we made it into a game.

I told my dad that for his next job he should become a stand-up comedian and he started laughing too. Our laughter was contagious and it kept us all in stitches. After a while, the mood had shifted noticeably, one of those magical moments where all of a sudden the joy is uncontainable and everyone feels connected in a way they hadn't before. 

Our laughter brought us closer together, and feeling so tightly knit it reminded me of just how much I loved and appreciated my family. We all had an amazing night that I'm sure we'll always remember!
