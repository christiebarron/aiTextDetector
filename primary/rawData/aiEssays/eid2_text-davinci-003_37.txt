Recently, there has been much heated debate regarding the issue of censorship in libraries across the United States. To some, it may be seen as a tool of oppression and a violation of the right to freedom of expression. However, to others, censorship is an essential tool used to protect vulnerable individuals and to avoid unnecessary offense.

Freedom of expression is an essential right, and any attempts to limit it should not be overlooked. In the case of libraries, it is fundamental that the institution is supportive of new and challenging ideas, while also providing an environment which is safe and free from harm. In this situation, it is necessary to understand that censorship should not be used as a suppressor of thought and existing perspectives, but rather as a tool to create a well-balanced library. 

While some may argue that censoring books, music, movies, and magazines is wrong, it is essential to understand that this is not done as a means of stopping people from exploring any particular content, but rather to ensure that a public setting is safe and suitable for all members of the community. This may involve removing books and other materials found to be offensive, such as hateful language and actions which could be considered as discriminatory towards any group. 

Censorship in libraries is necessary to ensure that no party is exposed to danger, such as those individuals who may be already vulnerable or those who may be negatively affected by exposure to certain materials. 

Ultimately, censorship in libraries should not be seen as an attack on freedom of expression, but as a tool to create a safe, balanced, and inclusive environment for all.
