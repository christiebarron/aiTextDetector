 

I was out on my morning jog around our neighborhood park when I ran into an old acquaintance of mine, Anna. We caught up a bit and when I asked her what she was doing since the last time I saw her, I couldn't help but laugh when she told me about her new job. 

She had gotten a job as a reindeer farmer to keep up with demand at Christmas. She had never heard of anyone doing something like this before, but hey, whatever pays the bills. Although it sounded amusing (and slightly ridiculous), I could tell she was proud of herself for finding a new and creative source of income. 

We chuckled at her new career path and I could feel the mood lightening. She suggested we grab a coffee and catch up properly, so we agreed to meet up the following day. We said our goodbyes and I left with a smile on my face.

That small bout of laughter marked the start of a new friendship, as Anna and I have been keeping in touch ever since that day. Laughter definitely was the shortest distance between us, bridging the gap that resulted from lack of contact in the past.  That's something I'll never forget.
