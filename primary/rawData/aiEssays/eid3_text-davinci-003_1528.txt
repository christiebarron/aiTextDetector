In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays a pivotal role in the cyclist's experience. The cyclist is riding alone and unaccompanied on a remote road through a desolate landscape.

The remoteness and desolation of the landscape create a feeling of vulnerability in the cyclist. There is a sense of dread and uncertainty that comes from being alone in a vast, unpopulated area. The cyclist is without people he can reach out to in an emergency, and the lack of any visible signs of civilization heighten his sense of isolation.

The landscape has a barren beauty, but it also suggests danger. The effects of the setting magnify the cyclistâ€™s feelings of helplessness and unease. He is in a place where he has no control over his environment or his fate, and he has to trust his own skills and navigate the path ahead.

The weather conditions add to this feeling of uncertainty and helplessness. It is not apparent at first what type of storm is going to emerge, and the cyclist worries that it could be violent and dangerous. He is powerless against the forces of nature, adding to the sense of dread.
