I remember one time when I was waiting in line at the DMV. It had already been a long day, and I was getting impatient as the line moved so slowly. I took a few deep breaths to try and keep calm. 

Finally, after what seemed like ages, I was next in line. The woman at the counter started to ask me questions, and I did my best to answer them patiently and politely even though I was feeling very frustrated. Then she asked me to provide a few documents I had forgotten to bring with me. I apologized and explained that I didn't have them.

The woman was so understanding and patient. She told me it was no problem and I could fill out a form to request a new set of documents. I was so relieved and grateful for her patience and understanding. That was a great example of someone being patient even when dealing with difficult circumstances.
