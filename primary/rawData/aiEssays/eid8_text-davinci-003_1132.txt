It was the first time my old friends and I had the opportunity to get together in ten years. We decided to meet in the park and catch up. We had all grown distant over the years, what with different lives going in different directions. So, I was a little wary, unsure of how the conversation would go.

But, as soon as we saw each other, everything changed. We all burst into laughter, not only because it was so great to see each other after such a long time, but also because all of us had changed so much. We took out embarrassing old photos from our high school days and all stood there laughing until our sides ached.

Suddenly, the uneasiness from all of us meeting up after so many years was gone and was replaced by familiarity and comfort. We then spent the rest of the day sharing stories, catching each other up on our lives, and laughing until we had tears in our eyes.

It was clear that our friendship was still strong and laughter had created a bridge between us, no matter how many years had passed.
