I recently had the opportunity to witness a truly remarkable display of patience. After a long day of work, I went to my local grocery store to pick up some food for dinner. As I was waiting in the checkout line, an elderly woman entered the store with several canned goods. She fumbled with her wallet as she attempted to pay with cash, but unfortunately she accidentally dropped her coins on the ground. The woman couldn't bend over to pick them up, so one kind young man offered to help. He quickly and quietly collected the coins and handed them back to the woman. She thanked him in a sweet and gentle voice, and he held her arm help her back up to her feet. She thanked him over and over, and the look of relief on her face was truly a touching sight. Anyone in the checkout line could have become frustrated with the slow process, but this man showed incredible patience and understanding. His kindness toward the elderly woman was truly inspiring.
