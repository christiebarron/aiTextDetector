I can remember it like it was just yesterday; the joyful laughter my mom and I shared. It was my 13th birthday and I was feeling a little blue that it was a school day and I was going to have to miss the small party we had planned that evening. My mom tried to cheer me up, but nothing was working.

That's when Mom came up with the genius idea to take me out for a lunch date during my lunch break, just the two of us. I was feeling pretty down and relunctant to go anywhere I suppose, but she sweet talked me and convinced me to go along.

When we finally got to the restaurant, the mood was somber. But that all changed when Mom started telling me a funny story about something that happened to her at work. Slowly but surely I started to crack a smile, and before long the two of us were in hysterics. It was one of those laughter fits where you can hardly catch your breath and your sides are aching, and it felt wonderful.

That moment will always stay with me and I cherish it so much. Even though it was a simple lunch break and it only lasted an hour, it will always be special to me. It was a moment that brought my mom and I together, and the sound of our laughter will always make me smile.
