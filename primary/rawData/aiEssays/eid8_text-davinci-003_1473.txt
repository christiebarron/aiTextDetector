I'll never forget the time I went camping with my best friend. We had hitched a ride up the mountain and hiked the rest of the way, blistered and exhausted. 

When we finally found a clearing to set up camp, we both collapsed on the ground and started laughing. It wasn't a nervous giggle or polite chuckle, it was a genuine belly laugh, and it felt so good. We lay there, taking in the sights, sounds and smells of nature, our laughter echoing through the trees. 

Before we knew it two hours had passed, and we were still giggling and snorting. It felt as though the whole forest was laughing with us. We were two exhausted, silly creatures, and the moment was unforgettable. 

No matter how hard things get, that moment always sticks with me. It was so much more than just the joy of being in nature â€“ it was a reminder that laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
