Dear  [Editor], 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Computers have become ubiquitous in our lives, and their impact has been far-reaching. On the one hand, they have improved the productivity of individuals, reduced the cost of production, and enabled easier access to information. On the other hand, it is important to consider the psychological impact of these devices. 

Research has suggested that computers can have both positive and negative effects on our mental health. For example, they can enable us to be more productive and efficient in our work, but they have also been linked to a rise in distractions, compulsions, and social problems such as cyberbullying, cyberstalking and privacy violations. 

However, it is important to note that, despite their potential negative aspects, computers can be extremely beneficial for individuals, particularly those dealing with physical or mental disabilities. Computers can allow them to connect with the wider world and communicate with others in ways that would have been impossible in the past. 

In conclusion, computers are incredibly powerful tools and can have both positive and negative effects on our lives. While we must bear in mind the potential risks, I believe that we should embrace these devices in order to take advantage of their incredible potential.

Yours sincerely, 

[Your name]
