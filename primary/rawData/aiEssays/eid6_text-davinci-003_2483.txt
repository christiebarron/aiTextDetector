The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a huge engineering challenge. The builders had to find a suitable solution to the added weight and stresses that a large airship docking would put on the building. The designers looked to the past as a guide, drawing on the historical concept of mooring masts used in other countries. 

The concept of the mooring mast was based on the idea of creating a large structure that could handle the weight and strain of a large airship docking. The Empire State Building was designed with a 200-foot-tall mast on the roof that could be used as a mooring point. The mast was securely affixed and constructed with a sturdy steel frame, making it capable of withstanding the wind and gusts created by the airships.

Despite the other advances made in engineering, the designers of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to make the building dirigible friendly. Safety and cost were the primary considerations for the engineers designing the mooring mast and determining how to properly and safely dock an airship.

The primary challenge surrounding the installation of a suitable mooring mast for airships was figuring out how to install a structure strong enough to support an airship, but not too expensive to make it economically feasible. The cost of the mooring mast and the necessary modifications needed to make it dirigible friendly needed to be balanced against the cost of constructing the entire building. The cost of a mooring mast had to be less than the financial benefits incurred by allowing airship landings at the building.
