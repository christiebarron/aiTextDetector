I was at the grocery store the other day, waiting in line to check out. The woman in front of me had a lot of items and was holding up the people behind her. I could tell some of the people were getting frustrated as the line was getting longer and longer. But I remained patient and kind, understanding that everyone has tough days and that I might need help or patience from others one day. I was even able to make subtle conversation, making the time go by faster. Eventually, the woman in front of me finished and I made it to the register. 
Later, I was walking out of the store and I saw the woman in front of me in line thanking the people around her for their patience. She apologized for taking so long, telling them she had a bad day and was grateful for their understanding. I felt proud to be part of such a kind and patient crowd
