It was my first time attending a concert with my then-boyfriend, and I was both thrilled and a little scared. I wasn't sure what to expect and I didn't want to make any missteps on this new, exciting experience. We were both huge fans of the band, and we were singing along as they played their favorite songs. After a while, my boyfriend said something to me that made me laugh and I couldn't help it. I just erupted with laughter, and in that moment, it felt like there was a silent understanding between us, like our relationship had grown just a little bit closer because of that shared laughter. We were in the middle of a huge crowd of people, but it felt like we were the only two in the room.

The energy between us only grew stronger as we shared more laughter throughout the night, and before I knew it, we were jumping up and down together, screaming some of the lyrics of our favorite songs â€“ laughing, holding hands and living in the moment.

That night, I knew I'd made the right choice in coming along with my boyfriend. That shared laughter showed me that we not only liked each other, but that we also looked out for each other, and that we could make a good team both in and out of the concert.
