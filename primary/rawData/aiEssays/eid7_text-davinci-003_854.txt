I was visiting an old friend in a town five hours away. After a day of catching up, it was time for me to catch my train home. I arrived at the station an hour before the scheduled departure, but the train was delayed more than an hour because the tracks were being repaired. 

I usually find waiting tedious, but accepted the wait without any complaining. I might have been tempted to raise my voice and demand an explanation, but I remained patient instead. I made the most of the time by quietly reading a book and listening to music. 

The wait seemed much longer than an hour which led me to worry that I wouldn't make other connections, but I continued to trust that everything would work out. 

When the train finally arrived, the conductor announced that he had been alerted of further delays. But instead of becoming frustrated, I remained patient to accept this new development and waited the additional two hours. 

When I eventually arrived at my home station, I was late but realized that I had been fortunate to make the connection at all given the delays. In the end, my patience was rewarded and felt relieved that I hadn't given up.
