It was a warm summer evening, and my friend and I were out for an after-dinner walk. We'd just finished dinner at our favorite restaurant, and we were both feeling pretty relaxed. As we were walking along, we started to talk about some of the silliest things we'd ever done. Before long, we were both laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces!

For a few minutes, nothing else matteredâ€”we were just in the moment, laughing together. We were so caught up in our laughter that we suddenly found ourselves in the middle of a public square. We quickly stopped laughing and glanced around, expecting to find an audience of disapproving people, but instead, they were all smiling and laughing along with us! We were surprised and delighted, and it only made us laugh harder.

Finally, our laughter slowly started to die down, and eventually, we found ourselves back on our walk. As we started to go our separate ways, I couldn't help but look back one last time at the square we'd been laughing in. In that moment, it felt like laughter had truly connected us to the people around us, and I couldn't have been more grateful.
