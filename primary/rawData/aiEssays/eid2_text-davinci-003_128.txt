Censorship in libraries is an important issue that needs to be addressed. Whether or not certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from a libraryâ€™s shelves is a decision that requires careful thought. 

On one hand, there is the argument in favor of censorship in libraries. People will argue that certain material can be potentially harmful or offensive, and should not be accessible to the public. Such materials may contain messages that are deemed immoral, unethical, or simply objectionable. 

On the other hand, the argument against censorship in libraries is that censorship can limit freedom of speech. It can prevent people from accessing information they may find to be important or life changing. This could potentially stifle intellectual growth and hinder the development of education. 

It is clear to me that, while both sides bring up valid points, censorship should not be practiced in libraries. Instead, libraries should maintain an atmosphere tolerant of different beliefs and ideas. This can be accomplished by allowing people to access the range of material available, while also providing warnings if certain material is deemed offensive. Such warnings should suffice in protecting people from offensive material, while still allowing them to pursue their intellectual interests in an atmosphere of open inquiry.

Furthermore, certain materials, if removed from library shelves, could still be pulled from external sources. This would limit freedom, as well as access to information and educational resources. 

In conclusion, libraries can play a major role in facilitating intellectual growth and free access to information. Instead of censoring certain materials, libraries should maintain an atmosphere of acceptance, understanding, and tolerance
