Dear Editor,

As a concerned citizen, I am writing about the effects computers have on people. It is no secret that technology has had a major impact on our lives; computers are currently one of the most pervasive and influential elements of our every day lives.

I am convinced that the effects of computer technology are largely positive. The internet and computers have made it easier to access information, giving us the ability to learn even more effectively. Computers have had an especially dramatic effect on how students acquire knowledge and skills: with just a few clicks we have the world at our fingertips! Moreover, they have facilitated communication and collaboration, allowing us to stay connected to friends and family across the globe. The development and utilization of computers have also helped to create countless jobs in various industries, further adding to the capacity of our global economy.

In conclusion, computers have had a major beneficial impact on our culture and can be seen as a prominent force for positive change. I encourage readers to consider the tremendous number of opportunities made possible because of computer technology, and see why such advances in personal computing should be applauded.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
