Once, when I was younger, I was helping my grandmother clean out her garden. She had a lot of old flowerpots and plants that needed to be taken out and replaced with new ones. As we were working, I noticed that my grandmother was moving a bit slower than usual. She told me that her knee had been bothering her lately and it was becoming difficult for her to bend down and dig into the soil.

Instead of getting frustrated, I decided to be patient and understanding. I decided to pick up the old pots and plants and move them out so that she wouldn't have to. I also took her some of the heavier items, like bags of soil and fertilizer, to carry them for her.

We worked together throughout the day, and at the end of it, we had accomplished a huge task. She thanked me for my help and for being so patient with her. It was a great feeling to have done a good deed, and to have done it with patience.
