Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on our society. With the advent of computers, it is undeniable that we have entered an era of unprecedented convenience, productivity, and efficiency, affecting almost every aspect of our lives.

However, as with all powerful tools, computers also come with certain risks that we should be aware of. Too much reliance on computer technology can lead to a lack of basic skills and knowledge. In addition, the ease and multitude of ways of obtaining information on the internet can lead to an overreliance on the internet for information, which can result in decreased critical thinking. Furthermore, heavy computer usage can lead to physical health problems such as soreness, headaches, and eyestrain.

But while we should be aware of the risks associated with computers, we should not use them as an excuse to completely abstain from technology. Instead, we must strive to use computers responsibly, making sure to keep our connectivity balanced by interacting with the physical world on a daily basis. Computers, when used properly, can be an incredibly valuable tool that can help enhance our lives in many ways.

In conclusion, computers can lead to both positive and negative impacts on our society, and it is important that we use them responsibly so we can reap the benefits while avoiding the risks. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
