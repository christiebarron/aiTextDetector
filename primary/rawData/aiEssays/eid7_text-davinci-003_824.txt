I was at the grocery store the other day, and I was in line to check out when the person in front of me had a lot of trouble paying with their card. 

The cashier had to keep trying different things to make the purchase, until suddenly the transaction was declined. At this point, most people would have gotten visibly frustrated, but the person in front of me stayed calm and composed. 

They politely explained their situation and asked if there was any way they could try to pay another way. After a few minutes they were able to ask their friend to Venmo them the money to cover the purchase.

The whole ordeal took probably around 10 or 15 minutes to resolve, but the person in front of me showed great amounts of patience throughout that time. Even with the frustrations of the situation, they never complained and stayed incredibly composed during the whole process. I was incredibly impressed with their capacity for understanding and tolerance.
