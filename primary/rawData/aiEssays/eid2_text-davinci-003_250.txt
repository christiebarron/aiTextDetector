In today’s digital world, libraries are a treasure trove of knowledge and a safe haven for discovery, exploration, and learning. It is vital to keep these community resources open to the public and ensure that their materials are accessible to all with an open-mind and the determination for knowledge. However, the topic of censorship in libraries has raised multiple concerns in recent years, particularly when it comes to selecting materials. 

I firmly believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves solely because someone finds them offensive. There is a real danger in censorship, as it can lead to the promotion of fears and biases. Libraries should be open and accepting to any and all people, allowing them the space to explore information and form their own opinions. Banning materials that are considered “offensive” only creates limitations and limits freedom of thought and expression. 

To protect the rights of library patrons, librarians should implement reasonable restrictions that fall within their respective censorship policies while still allowing access to materials on the shelves that may be “controversial”. According to the American Library Association’s interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights, libraries should provide material for all ages and interests which includes materials of all points of view. Libraries should also work to provide materials to those who disagree with controversial topics, not just those who agree. 

It is essential for libraries to be spaces of free speech where all information is openly accessible to avoid limiting library patrons’ access to knowledge. Keeping materials on their shelves allows patrons to access information and form their own opinions
