Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and why I believe readers should agree with me.

As technology continues to evolve, so too does our reliance on computers. We rely on them for work, communication and entertainment, making them a central part of our everyday activities. But with the rise of computers come certain drawbacks. Too often people forget to look away from their screens and disconnect from the internet, which can lead to a lack of physical activity, poor vision, and issues with mental health.

This is why I feel it is important that we take steps to ensure proper use of computers. Reading material should be viewed on paper, not screens, in order to protect childrenâ€™s vision. And physical exercise should be incorporated into our daily routines for a healthy balance. We must also be mindful of our mental health. Too much time in front of a computer can lead to increased levels of stress, loneliness and depression.

For all these reasons, I believe it is important that we accept computers as a part of our lives but recognise and take responsibility for their potential drawbacks. I urge readers to join me in my commitment and develop good habits when using computers, so that we may benefit from them without creating adverse effects.

Yours sincerely, 

[Your Name]
