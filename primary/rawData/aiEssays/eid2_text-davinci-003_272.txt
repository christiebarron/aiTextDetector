In the age of digital information, libraries remain one of the last strongholds of free-flowing knowledge, providing citizens access to information on nearly any topic. For this reason, censorship of information in libraries should not be tolerated and citizens should have the right to access books, music, movies, and magazines of their choice, no matter how controversial they may be.

Censorship of libraries stifles free speech and limits access to important and sometimes difficult topics of conversation. Libraries should be a place where people can access the widest possible array of materials to form their own opinion and educate themselves on a broad range of topics. This includes access to the most controversial materials. Censorship of any kind would only limit citizens ability to make informed and educated decisions about their own lives and the world around them.

In this age of rapid information, libraries must be places of inquiry and ideas. To restrict access to certain materials, no matter how offensive, does a disservice to all citizens, especially those who may not have access to the internet or other sources of information. It also limits our understanding of different perspectives and views on the world. Libraries should be places where everyone feels welcome and can find the resources they need to gain knowledge. 

Furthermore, censorship of materials contradicts core values of intellectual freedom found in the Constitutionâ€™s First Amendment; the state should not act as mediator of thought and opinion. We must trust individuals to make the right decisions with their own research and be protected in their right to access different materials.

Ultimately, libraries should remain institutions of free expression and unfiltered knowledge. The
