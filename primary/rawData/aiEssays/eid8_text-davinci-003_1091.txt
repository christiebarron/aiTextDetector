I was out with my best friend the other day, when something funny happened. We were killing time in the mall, strolling around aimlessly, when I noticed a mannequin in a store window wearing the craziest outfit. She was dressed like a court jester, with a funny little hat, jingling bell collar, and a loud purple and gold jumpsuit. 

I started to laugh as soon as I saw her, and my friend soon joined in. After a few minutes of us howling with laughter, we noticed that the store manager was standing in the doorway watching us. To my surprise, she started to chuckle too.

At first I thought we were in trouble for disturbing her shop, but then I realized she was laughing with us. She used the mannequinâ€™s remote control to make her jingle the bells even louder, and suddenly the mall corridor was echoing with laughter as passersby heard the funny scene.

It was one of the most memorable moments of our friendship. We knew that, no matter what life throws at us, laughter will always be just a moment away.
