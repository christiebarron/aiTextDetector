To the editor: 

In light of recent controversy surrounding censorship in libraries, I am writing to express my opinion on the matter. I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves, regardless of whether they may be viewed as offensive by some. 

At its core, libraries are a place of knowledge. To remove books or other materials from their shelves due to the mere suggestion that they are offensive sends a strong message that is antithetical to their mission. Libraries serve to educate, enlighten and expand the minds of their patrons. Excluding certain materials, however harmless, undermines their goal.

Moreover, we cannot allow those in positions of power to dictate what is and is not appropriate, as this would create an alarming precedent of censorship. Free speech, whether it offends some or not, must be able to exist uninhibited. We should instead focus on teaching individuals how to navigate the complexities of the material available, and use them to think critically, form opinions, and engage in meaningful dialogue.

That said, libraries would be wise to provide content advisories and warning labels to inform patrons of materials that may be uncomfortable or inappropriate. Heavy-handed censorship is not the answer. We must trust people to make their own decisions and allow them to explore and learn as they wish. 

Sincerely,
