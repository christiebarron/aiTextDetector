I was a patient person when I went to the supermarket recently. I had to wait in line for about half an hour, as the store was extremely busy. I could see the expression people in the line ahead of me were showing sign of impatience - tapping their feet, looking around or shifting their weight from one leg to the other. But I just waited calmly and quietly.

Finally, I was the next one in line. I got all the items I had come for and as I was paying the cashier, I found that I had made a mistake with the items and had forgotten to buy something. Without panicking, I explained the situation to the cashier and he told me no problem and asked me to take the forgotten items.

I smiled and took the items, then went back to the cashier and paid for them. I was glad that I had stayed patient and hadn't given up or got angry, as I'm sure I would have had to apologize and would have made the situation much worse. Waiting in line was not fun, but in the end, I got what I needed, without making a scene.
