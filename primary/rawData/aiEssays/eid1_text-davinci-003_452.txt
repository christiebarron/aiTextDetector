Dear Editor:

Since their emergence, computers have had a huge effect on the way people live their lives. It is an undeniable fact that our lives today are heavily reliant on computers. They are used by individuals on a daily basis, and at the same time, computers are essential in the business, educational and governmental sectors. 

Despite the numerous benefits of owning a computer, there are also some downsides to consider. For those who spend too much time on the computer, they can suffer from a loss of physical activity, sleep disturbances, and a decrease in social activities. This can have a profound effect on both physical and mental health. Additionally, computers can be a source of distraction and procrastination, which can lead to decreased productivity and unfulfilled goals.

On balance, I believe that the positives of owning a computer far outweigh the negatives. Computers enable us to access vast amounts of information, stay connected with our friends and families, and do things faster and more efficiently. Moreover, computers can promote educational opportunities and help to increase communication between people from all over the world.

Thus, although the long-term effects of computers are still unknown, I believe that computer usage can be kept within safe limits and can bring many positives for us in the present.

Sincerely, 

[Name]
