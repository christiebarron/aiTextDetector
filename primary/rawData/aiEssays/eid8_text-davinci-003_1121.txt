I recently had the pleasure of visiting my grandparents in their cozy old house up in the countryside. My grandfather has always been known for his great sense of humour and it was no different on this day. He and I were sat out in the garden, soaking up the summer sun with our iced teas in hand.

My grandfather started to tell me one of his usual hilarious anecdotes. I could feel myself having to bite back the laughter that was always so ready to erupt, in fear of upsetting him with my less-than-refined hearty guffaw, but this time the inner struggle proved too hard and I found myself exploding in uncontrollable giggles.

My grandfather got just as taken away with the moment, and before we knew it, the two of us were laughing so hard there were tears streaming down our faces. I quickly wiped away the beads of sweat and tears from my face and took a deep breath, my sides still aching from laughing.

It was one of those silent moments in which the atmosphere was filled with an inexplicable sense of joy and contentment, where I felt an unspoken understanding pass between us. It was just a moment, but it was something magical and I will always treasure it.
