I was recently at work when someone was having trouble understanding a concept that I had explained to them numerous times. Although I was getting frustrated, I remained patient and understanding with the person. I took deep breaths and was determined to help them understand, no matter how long it took. I knew that the person was trying their best and I wanted to help in any way I could. After patiently working with them for over an hour, the person finally had a lightbulb go off in their head and began to understand the concept. It was a truly rewarding feeling and I was proud of myself for my patience and determination.
