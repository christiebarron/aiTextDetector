The setting in Joe Kurmaski's “Rough Road Ahead” has a significant impact on the cyclist. The setting is described as a steep, winding, unpaved road that is full of loose rocks and dangerous obstacles. This setting presents a number of risks and challenges to the cyclist which have a direct impact on the cyclist's safety and performance.

The unpaved road and rocky terrain makes the road a challenging surface to ride on, and greatly increases the difficulty of maneuvering safely on the road. The rough surface puts extra stress on the cyclist's body, resulting in fatigue and potential injury. It also requires the cyclist to maintain a greater focus on their balance, as one wrong move could send them crashing to the ground. Furthermore, the dangers that exist in the form of loose rocks, potholes, and other debris can cause the cyclist to suffer through moments of panic as they encounter unexpected obstacles.

The steep climb of the hill presents another obstacle for the cyclist. The steep rise makes it more difficult to reach the top, requiring more energy and effort to continue. This, coupled with the rugged terrain, can increase the cyclist's struggle as they attempt to reach the summit.
