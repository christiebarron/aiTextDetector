I had just gone on my first date with my now fiancé. We had had a lovely dinner, and the conversation had been great. As the evening was drawing to a close and our time together was over, we both felt a little awkward. We weren't sure how to part ways, and both of us felt a bit shy. Suddenly, a dog ran across the street and my date started to laugh. I couldn’t help but join in, laughing out loud in relief. 

Before we knew it, we were both doubled over, barely able to catch our breath amidst the hilarity of the moment. As the laughter slowly subsided, the awkwardness between us vanished. Suddenly, it felt like we had known each other our entire lives. We decided to go for one more drink to cap off the evening, and that was the start of our real relationship. Laughter broke the ice between us, and I’ll be forever grateful for that moment.
