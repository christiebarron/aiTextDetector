Built in 1931, the Empire State Building was designed to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. However, in the mid-1930s, numerous obstacles had to be overcome for the engineers to achieve the vision of a building that contained the necessary “mooring mast” to dock the airships.

The mooring mast presented several structural challenges, considering the immense size and weight of the dirigibles. For example, the construction of the mast needed to meet Federal Aviation Administration regulations for the secure tethering of 328,000 cubic feet of hydrogen contained in the dirigible. Additionally, the installation of the mast had to be done safely and securely to be strong enough to both support the airship and protect the building. Furthermore, the location of the mast was a great challenge, taking into consideration the building's established height and the precarious winds of the area.

The post-construction maintenance of the mooring mast was an even bigger issue. Because of the engineering and construction difficulties, the mast was rarely used and it called for a complex process of servicing, maintenance and repair. This was expensive and time consuming and was slow to show returns on the investment. Furthermore, the mooring mast required a fixed flight crew, when the dirigible arrived for mooring. Issues of weather, visibility and the hazardous nature of docking were addressed with extensive safety measures.

Ultimately, it was a combination of engineering challenges, windy conditions, cost-inefficiency and safety concerns that prevented the Empire State Building from becoming the center of dirigible traffic in New York. Despite the eventual success of
