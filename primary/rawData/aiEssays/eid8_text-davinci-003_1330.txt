I was out to dinner with my good friend. We were laughing and joking about our time in college and all the crazy ways life had changed since then. I started doing my best impression of our old history professor. It was spot on and my friend started roaring with laughter. I kept going, despite feeling completely ridiculous, and before I knew it we had the entire restaurant laughing along with us. I felt so connected to my friend in that moment and it was beautiful. We both looked at each other, cheeks sore from laughter, and in that moment, I was reminded of how much I valued our friendship. It felt like we could tell each other anything and still end up in a fit of laughter. That night taught me that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
