Dear Editor,

Technology is something that has undoubtedly had a major impact on modern society. Computers, in particular, are one of the most commonly used pieces of tech and have changed the ways in which many people work, communicate and entertain themselves. In my opinion, the impact computers have on people is overwhelmingly positive, though I understand that some individuals may feel overwhelmed or uneasy about this technology.

It's true that digital technology has enabled people to stay connected with others more quickly and efficiently than ever before. That means people don't have to worry about missing out on important events or news from loved ones no matter how far away they may be. Furthermore, computers have opened up entirely new careers for people, and the digital economy of our modern world has generated immense economic growth and opportunities for businesses of all sizes.

At the same time, computers have improved communication efficiency and allowed us to access more information than ever before. By using computer technology, people can research and analyze a wealth of data that would otherwise be impossible to access. In addition, computers have enabled us to store information in far more efficient ways and with greater security.

Finally, computer-based learning can help promote creativity among both children and adults. Computers can help create an engaging learning environment that can spark imagination and teach problem-solving skills in ways that can be more appealing than traditional instruction.

For all these reasons, I believe the overall impacts of computers on people are overwhelmingly positive
