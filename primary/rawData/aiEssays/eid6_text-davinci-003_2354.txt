The proposal of having dirigibles dock atop the Empire State Building, made by U.S. and international publicity genius David Sarnoff in 1931, was a groundbreaking concept. With the successful completion of the building of the Empire State Building in 1931, dirigible mooring had become a reality at the worldâ€™s tallest skyscraper. However, the sheer magnitude and potential of the project made the process of allowing dirigibles to dock an immensely complicated one.

One of the major obstacles that needed to be addressed was the structural stability of the building. Since dirigible docking required the installation of a mast that would shift the center of gravity of the Empire State Building, the construction team was faced with the challenge of ensuring the stability of the building so that it could withstand the additional stresses that the mast put on the structure. The solution to this problem was the creation of a dock that was placed well above the pinnacle of the building and extending the base downward, thus providing an even center of gravity and structural stability.

Despite the success of the structural solution to the dock, the builders of the Empire State Building also had to grapple with several technological and engineering issues. One of these was the problem of electric power and fuel to power the elevators and cranes that would be required to maneuver the airships. This was solved by the engineering team by linking the tower to the electric and fuel lines of the nearby Manhattan Bridge. Additionally, the engineers had to ensure that the navigation and navigation signals required for a safe docking operation were available, which was eventually achieved through the installation of a transmitter on the mast for communication with
