It is important to note that censorship is a relative concept that tends to vary based on various perspectives. So it begs the question: should we censor certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries if they are deemed offensive? In my opinion, no â€” we should not.

We must consider censorship within the context of a library's role in a community. Libraries exist to provide information access, preserve materials, and promote knowledge and education. All of these goals should be upheld and respected. When materials are censored from a library's shelves, it can impede an individual's ability to access information and be exposed to different perspectives. It restricts the potential of education and promotes ignorance or limited viewpoints. This goes against the spirit of libraries and jeopardizes their intended purpose.

Libraries are often subject to immense pressure from outside organizations to censor materials which can lead to the censorship of certain materials while leaving others untouched. This lack of consistency makes censorship an unreliable approach to healthy discourse or respectful dialogue.
