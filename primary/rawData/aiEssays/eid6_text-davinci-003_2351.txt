The process of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was no simple feat. Constructed in the early 1930s, the building was the tallest in the world at the time and required a complex plan in order to accommodate these new airships. The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building ranged from its unique design, to the start of the Great Depression, to the difficulty of finding a proper mooring mast.

When the Empire State Building was first conceived, its primary purpose was not to act as a landing port for dirigibles. This meant that the structure of the building had to be re-engineered in order to support the load of a fully loaded airship. To overcome this obstacle, Robert Moses, the parks commissioner of New York City, tasked the building’s architects, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon with the responsibility of devising a plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

The second obstacle facing the builders of the Empire State Building was the beginning of the Great Depression. The widespread economic downturn brought immense pressure to trim costs and the idea of investing in expensive mooring mast technology seemed infeasible. But the commission pushed forward and the mooring mast was finally approved.

Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building needed to find a mooring mast solution that was both practical and safe. The mooring mast proposed was unique in that it would allow dirigibles to dock without coming into contact with the building and allowing it to stay suspended in midair. According to Marcia Amidon Lü
