I remember the first time I met my future husband, we both had a good laugh. It was all sparked by a comment he made about me being the only one in the room wearing glasses. It felt strange but nice to laugh together and I could tell it was the beginning of something special.

We continued to talk and get to know each other, and our conversation kept us in stitches. Life had been throwing us some curveballs lately, but with humor, we were able to find common ground to take the edge off.

After we had been seeing each other for a few months, we went for a weekend camping trip to a nearby lake. The drive over was full of laughter, especially when we tripped over our own words. We spent the whole time there, sharing jokes, laughing at our own silliness, and just having a good time.

I knew then that our relationship was something special. No matter how much time passed, we always found a way to bring the laughter back and keep our relationship alive and passionate.

Since then, we've been married and we still can't stop laughing. We share a unique, beautiful kind of humor in our relationship that often leaves us in tears, which is the best way to end the day!
