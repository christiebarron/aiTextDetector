I will never forget the moment when my partner and I first started to laugh together. We had only been dating a few weeks, and we were walking home from a movie we had seen together. We had a great time at the movies, but neither of us had said much to each other on the way home. 

Suddenly, my partner stumbled in a pothole and I couldn't help but giggle. I looked over at her and she was staring at the ground with a look of embarrassment on her face. Trying to comfort her, I said, "Hey, I'm sure you weren't the first person to trip in that pothole!" 

That's when it happened. We both started laughing - and neither of us wanted to stop. It felt like we were connected in that moment, as if there weren't any barriers between us. We laughed until we had to pause to catch our breath, and then we just looked at each other and smiled, both of us relieved to have broken the silence.

Ever since then, laughter has been a sort of secret language that my partner and I share. It's a reminder of the connection that we have, and the comfort that we both find in the safety of our relationship.
