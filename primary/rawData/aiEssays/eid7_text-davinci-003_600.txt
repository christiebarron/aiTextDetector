I had a really stressful day at work. Everything that could have gone wrong, did. I had to stay late to finish a project and I was exhausted by the time I got home.

My husband greeted me with a full house. We had three parties of friends over for dinner. We had planned to cook together, but with my schedule, there wasn’t enough time. He had run around all day getting food and setting up. 

As I walked in, I started to feel overwhelmed and angry. I was tired and cranky, and didn’t want to deal with all the people. 

But my husband was so patient with me. He came over and put his arm around me, and just said “Let’s do this. I know it’s a lot.” He was so calm and understanding, and I knew he truly wanted to make things better. 

So instead of getting angry, I took a deep breath and started to clean up and get things organized. We chatted with our guests while prepping and cooking, and by the end of the night, everyone was content and happy. 

I was so grateful for my husband’s patience and understanding. He made a stressful situation much more manageable.
