The Empire State Building was built in New York City during the early 1930s and was renowned for its height and advanced design for the era. During its construction, the builders of the Empire State Building had the ambitious goal of providing docking for dirigibles at the very top of the building, thus allowing passengers to disembark from their vessels and enjoy the view from approximately 1,050 feet in the air.

The task of enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a Herculean one, and the builders faced numerous challenges. Structural strength was a primary obstacle. The docking facility had to be strong enough to withstand the weight of the airships as well as changes in air pressure and weather, thus necessitating extra reinforced steel for the platform and its associated mooring mast. While the extra steel basis was already incorporated in the buildings design, it still required reinforcement.

Furthermore, despite the added reinforcement, the issue of changing wind conditions had to be addressed. To help counteract the potential effects of wind, a mooring mast was designed and installed at the top of the building. The mast was designed to be adjustable, allowing it to be raised and lowered in response to prevailing winds. This was intended for the vessel to attach itself to the mast and remain firmly in place, helping to prevent the dirigibles from swinging in strong winds.

On top of these structural and weather challenges, the designers of the “mooring mast” also had to consider navigational requirements. They had to account for the flattening of the Earth’s curvature as well as the need
