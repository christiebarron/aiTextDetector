I remember when I was in line at the grocery store the other day and it was taking a really long time. People were getting frustrated and starting to mumble complaints to each other. It was really starting to get to me when I remembered to be patient and take a deep breath. I reminded myself that everyone has different circumstances and that sometimes they take longer. So, I just stood there, keeping my thoughts to myself, and kept breathing. 

Eventually, the line started to move again and everyone started to relax. I'm sure that if I hadn't kept my own emotions in check and just waited patiently, the situation would have been a lot worse. Being patient can be hard at times, but it certainly has its rewards.
