Dear [Editor],

The advances in technology have had a remarkable effect on the way we live today, and computers are at the forefront of that change. My opinion is that the effects computers have on people are overwhelmingly positive, as they have opened up so many new possibilities and ways of performing tasks that were either not available or excessively time-consuming before.

For example, before computers, people would have to do strenuous calculations by hand, and perform complex tasks that would take inordinate amounts of time to complete. Computers have now made these tasks a breeze, with their powerful processing capabilities and the sheer amount of data they can store. This is allowing for increased efficiency in the workplace and making it easier for people to learn, work, and collaborate on a variety of different tasks.

In addition, computers have enabled us to communicate with people from all around the world in real time, as well as access vast stores of information in the form of digital libraries. This has greatly increased our knowledge and enabled us to research and study new topics and subjects more quickly than ever before.

All in all, the effects computers have on people are undeniably positive and should be celebrated. Computers are continuing to empower and educate us in amazing ways and help us to become even more productive in our everyday lives. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
