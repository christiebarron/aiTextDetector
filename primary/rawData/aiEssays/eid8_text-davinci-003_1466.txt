My first job out of college was a sales representative at a small software company. I was terrified but determined to do the best I could. After a few weeks, I started to get the hang of it, and I made several successful sales that boosted my confidence. 

One day, I was heading out of the office to cover a client’s territory when I got a call from a prospect. We just couldn’t seem to connect. He kept asking me the same questions, and I kept giving him the same answers. We must've both been frustrated at the same time. 

Then, totally out of the blue, this man lets out a loud hearty laugh and says: “This is ridiculous.” I burst out laughing too, in surprise and delight that I’d been given an unexpected gift. We finished up our conversation, making sure that all his questions had been answered, and he ended up purchasing the software. 

The laughter had broken through our impasse and both of us were in a much better place. I later learned that the man had grown up in the same city I had. He eventually became one of my best clients and we continue to have a great relationship. 

That moment of shared laughter was a break in a stressful situation. It was a reminder that laughter is something that can bridge the gap between two people, and I’ve kept that memory close ever since.
