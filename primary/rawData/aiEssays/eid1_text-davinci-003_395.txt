Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. In my opinion, computers are a fantastic tool that have had a great positive effect on our lives.

Firstly, computers have given us access to a vast range of information that was previously unavailable or hard to find. From research to news, we can access almost anything at the click of a button. This has revolutionized the way we learn and access knowledge, meaning we have more access to information than ever before.

Secondly, computers have improved our communication capabilities. Communication was once a slow and laborious process, now we can chat with anyone around the world quickly and easily. This means that people now have the opportunity to check in with family, meet new friends and express their opinions to a wider audience.

Finally, computers are beneficial in numerous other ways. We can shop online, stream movies, play video games and more. The many different uses of computers mean that we can stay entertained, find convenient solutions for everyday tasks and stay connected with each other.

I hope that this letter has convinced you of the many positive effects computers have had on people. They are an invaluable tool that has improved our lives in so many different ways.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
