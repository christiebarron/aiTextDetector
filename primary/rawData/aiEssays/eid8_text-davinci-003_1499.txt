I remember the first time I shared a laugh with my best friend like it was yesterday. It was a Tuesday night and she had come over to my house for our usual study session. We were studying for exams, and the pressure to do well was immense.

Suddenly, she bumped the side of her foot against the desk and stumbled into me, screaming. I couldn't help but burst out laughing. Her face was bright red and she was looking at me with a mix of embarrassment and surprise. 

I was expecting her to be mad or embarrassed but, instead, she started to laugh too. It was infectious and soon we were both in a fit of giggles. It felt like a weight had been lifted off of us and we could finally relax a little bit. 

That moment cemented our friendship. We've laughed over countless silly moments since that day, and it reminds me how important it is to laugh and enjoy our time together. Laughter truly is the best medicine!
