I remember one time when I was shopping with my mom at the grocery store. We had a lengthy shopping list and it was taking forever. People were cutting in line and being rude, which was causing the line to move even slower. I could feel my patience wearing thin and my mom could tell, so she put her arm on my shoulder and said, "Take deep breaths and stay patient. You never know what someone else is feeling and why they are rushing around." 

Her reminder was enough to help me remain calm and cool. I breathed in and out and concentrated on being present in the moment. Eventually, the line cleared out, but even if it didn't, I knew I could rely on my mom's words to keep me patient and understanding.
