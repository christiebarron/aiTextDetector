I have always been a bit of an introvert, so it can be a challenge for me to open up to people. One person who changed this for me was Katie, a friend I made during my first year of college. 

At first the conversations we had never really ventured past small talk. Whenever we were in the same room, there was an awkwardness neither of us could seem to shake. But one day, out of nowhere, we both began to laugh. It was like a spell had been broken. 

We were talking about our plans for the weekend, and she made a small joke I didn't expect. Even though it was a young, naive joke, I felt myself chuckle, and then more of a lasting laugh. I looked up at her, shocked that she had managed to make me laugh, and it got us both going harder. 

It was amazing to feel that connection with someone for the first time. We kept laughing until there were tears in our eyes. After that we laughed a lot together. It felt like such a relief to have someone to laugh with, and it made spending time together so much easier. 

In the time since then, we have gone through a lot together, but our shared laughter has always been a light in the darkness. We know that no matter what, we have each other to rely on to laugh away any obstacle.
