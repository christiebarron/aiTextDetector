I was recently visiting a new city and decided to take a tour to see some of the major attractions. Unfortunately when I arrived at the starting point the group had already left. I knew I wouldn't be able to catch up to them before the tour ended, but I didn't want to give up hope.

The tour guide had left a note saying to call the office number if we missed the start time. When I called, I was pleased to find out that someone would come back and pick me up, but I had to wait for over an hour. Even though I was frustrated at having missed my chance to see the city with the group, I remained patient.

I watched the birds fly around and enjoyed observing some of the local architecture. I kept a positive outlook, knowing that I would still get to experience the tour. 

Finally, the driver pulled up and my patience was rewarded. I hopped in the car and we drove to all the major tourist spots. I was glad that I didn't give in to my impatience and I ended up having a great experience.
