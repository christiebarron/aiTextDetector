The construction of the Empire State Building was an arduous and ambitious project. The challenge of allowing dirigibles, such as the ill-fated Hindenburg, to dock at the building was an especially difficult obstacle to overcome. In The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the daunting process of altering the famed skyscraper in order to make it an option for airships to safely moor.

The planning process began while the building was still under construction. A lofty mooring mast twice the height of the building was realized as the ideal solution. This tower, equipped with an observation deck, elevator, and pressurized air, would provide a safe point of attachment for the dirigible and support its extensive weight. However, the project proved to be far more difficult than anyone had anticipated.

Finding a suitable location for the mast within the building’s framework posed a serious problem. A structural analysis revealed that integrating a heavy tower within the confines of the unsteady steel framework would be almost impossible. After a search for other viable solutions, they settled on positioning the mooring mast just outside the building. This solution eventually proved to be successful, with adjustments to the metal frame and higher steel columns to support the increased weight.

Additional issues slowed the construction, including challenging weather conditions and budgetary constraints. Though the project was expensive and would only provide a small return on investment, the builders persevered with the goal of allowing airships to dock within the city. After a difficult and lengthy process, the mast was eventually completed and outfitted in 1930.
