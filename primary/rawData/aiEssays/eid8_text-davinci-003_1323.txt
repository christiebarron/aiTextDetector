I was in bed with my girlfriend one night, nothing unusual. We were just snuggling up and talking as we often did. We were casually chatting about our day and nothing particularly funny had been said. Suddenly, my girlfriend's hand jerked out and she tickled my nose in what was clearly an attempt at a joke. She started to laugh and before long I couldn't help but to join in. We both ended up poking each other and tickling in ways that we hadn't before, and soon it was all we were doing.

At first it was just us two, but pretty soon we had our entire dorm room roaring with laughter. Everyone was looking at us, some of our friends joining in as well. After awhile, the laughter had died down and everyone went back to their own business.

But in that moment, it didn't matter. We had shared something without ever having to say a word, and it was something that only the two of us knew at that moment. It was something that made me feel closer to my girlfriend and comforted in our relationship. From then on, we were always looking for moments to laugh together.
