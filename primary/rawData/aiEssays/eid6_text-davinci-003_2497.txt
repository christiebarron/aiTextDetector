The building of the iconic Empire State Building was a monumental achievement, but it also presented a unique challenge to its architects when they were asked to build a mooring mast suitable for the docking of dirigibles. This was a particularly difficult feat in the 1920’s and 1930’s when the building was constructed, because the process had never been done before. The architects, along with the dreamers, were up against several obstacles during their endeavor.

The most notable obstacle was actually the building itself. When the mast was to be installed, it quickly became evident that the Empire State Building was simply not suitable for mooring dirigibles. The building was too tall, too slim, and lacked the stability needed for such a construction. Additionally, the areas surrounding the building were not conducive to a landing site. The air above the buildings was often too turbulent, and the streets below were overcrowded with traffic and extremely narrow. 

The architects had to devise a way to make mooring the dirigibles both possible and practical. To do this, they had to explore a variety of solutions. They had to look at the different locations and consider height, surface area, strength, and the nearby buildings. The mast was designed to have a much wider circumference at the top and was strengthened with additional steel bands. This meant that the necessary landings were much more stable and secure.

Another obstacle was the amount of money it would cost to build the mast. Not only did the material and labor require a significant amount of money, but the resulting diversion of resources caused plans to change and be
