The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski plays an important role in the story. Set in a small town in rural Wisconsin, the cyclist of the story is set to battle the rough terrain and elements of the rural Midwest. The rural Midwest setting is full of interesting features that affect the cyclist.

The physical features of the Midwest setting are one of the main influences on the cyclist. The rolling roads and hills of the setting make the cyclist work harder to navigate the terrain and make progress.

The rural scenes and wildlife give the cyclist a moment of calm amidst the hard ride, which helps to keep them going. The natural beauty of the environment assist in helping the cyclist leave their worries behind and embrace the ride and
