The ending of Minfong Ho's 'Winter Hibiscus' paints a picture of a character determined to stay optimistic in the face of a difficult challenge. Though the hibiscus plant has been uprooted and taken to a place where it may not make it through the winter, the character--facing a major test---resolves to try again in the spring when the plant will have returned and flourished. 

The resilience of the character in the face of such challeing conditions symbolizes the determination of all those who hope to better their circumstances. As they continue to push forward despite the odds, they can remember the hibiscus and its promise of reawakening and reviving in the same way that their own lives can do. By associating with the hibiscus, the idea of rebirth after a difficult winter takes on a more significant meaning with each passing season.
