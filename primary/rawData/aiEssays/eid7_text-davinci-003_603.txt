I was recently in an airport waiting to board my flight back home. The announced flight time had come and gone and there was still no sign of our plane arriving. I had been feeling anxious, this was my first time travelling alone and I was really eager to get home.

To make matters worse, the situation just seemed to be getting worse. The gate was crowded, people were getting testy and people were starting to get vocal about how long we had been waiting. I heard some people start complaining and demanding answers from the airline staff, but I just took a deep breath and decided to remain patient.

I knew that this situation wasn't the staff's fault, and that they were doing their best in trying to accommodate everyone. So instead of joining in the complaining and negativity, I decided to focus on the positives. I grabbed my phone, put on my headphones and began listening to my favorite music. A few minutes later, I noticed that the atmosphere around the gate had become much calmer and more relaxed.

The airline staff had informed us that the plane was just having a few minor delays and it arrived just a few minutes later. Sure enough, we were finally able to board and I was even more relieved as I was making my way back home. I'm so glad I chose to be patient instead of getting worked up and adding to the already tense atmosphere.
