I recently had to wait in a long line at the doctor’s office. I was running late and already stressed out from the morning’s events. The waiting room was crammed full of people, and I realized that it would be a long wait before I was seen. 

Instead of having a meltdown, I tried to keep my patience. I took deep breaths and tried to find something to focus my attention on. I closed my eyes and tried to dissolve into my own space by envisioning how great I would feel after it was all over. 

I waited as the line slowly inched forward, and even smiled at the other people in the waiting room. I understood that everyone there was stressed out and just wanted to get to the doctor quickly. 

Eventually, my name was called and I made it through the office visit. I felt really proud of myself for managing my stress, and the sense of peace I felt afterward was worth the wait.
