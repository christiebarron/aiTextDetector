I remember the day I met my best friend, fondly. He and I were sitting in history class, both trying to stay awake while the teacher spoke. I had noticed him throughout the year, but we had never actually exchanged words. Then, suddenly, something changed that day. 

It all started when the teacher made an awkward joke, one that only a few people laughed at. I was one of those few people and when I laughed, my future best friend started to giggle. At first it was meek, but then it quickly escalated until we were both laughing hysterically. The teacher and the rest of the class were looking at us with confused expressions, but we didnâ€™t care. We just kept laughing and laughing, not even noticing when the bell rang signaling the end of class. 

It was at that moment that I knew we were meant to be friends. We laughed and joked together every day from then on. None of our struggles could override the connection we had. That laughter we shared that day was the bond that tied us together.
