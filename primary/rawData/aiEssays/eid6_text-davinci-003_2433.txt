The construction of the Empire State Building was an incredible undertaking, but one of its most ambitious goals was allowing dirigibles to dock at the 102nd-floor landing mast. It was an expensive undertaking, and the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome numerous obstacles to make it happen. 

The first challenge was the building's construction plans. The original plan only called for a roof at the 102nd floor, with no way of harnessing the winds that might propel a mooring mast. The architects had to redesign the building structure to accommodate a mooring mast as tall as the building â€“ about 500 feet tall. To support such a large mast, the building's steel frame needed to be strengthened, adding extra costs and taking up valuable time. 

The second obstacle was the location of the Empire State Building. Located on a busy Manhattan street, the site was not suitable for landing dirigibles. The only place with adequate clearance was the proposed 102nd floor. But this created another issue: the mast would have to extend out of the rooftop, making it vulnerable to strong winds caused by the traffic below. To counter this, the mooring mast was hyper-engineered with reinforcing ribs and rods, enabling it to withstand the strong winds that would blow up the side of the building. 

Third, the engineers had to meet the demands of the New York City Board of Airports. According to their guidelines, the mooring mast had to be robust enough to withstand high winds, as well as to hold the dirigible steady in the event of a sudden gust that could turn
