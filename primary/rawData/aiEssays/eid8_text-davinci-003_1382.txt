I remember it like it was yesterday â€“ the day laughter saved my relationship.

My partner and I had been having a rough week. We were both under a lot of stress and we were struggling to find common ground. We had gone through a few days of tense silences and occasional arguments, and the atmosphere was becoming stifling. 

One night we decided to take a break and go out for dinner to try and reconnect. We talked about our days and the stressors we had been facing, and for the first time in days we both felt relaxed. 

And then, something hilarious happened. We both dropped our napkins on the floor and instinctively reached for the same one. Our glances met, and we both burst into laughter. 

We kept exchanging humorous remarks and laughing to the point of tears. It was silly and awkward, but it felt so natural and enjoyable. In that moment I knew that the tension had melted away, and the rest of the night was spent in companionable conversation.

That night of simple, shared laughter taught me that laughter can be the bridge between two people when all else has failed. It showed me that when relationships get tough, sometimes the best solution is to simply laugh. To this day, whenever there is disagreement between us, I try to lighten the mood with a funny story, and laughter is always the solution.
