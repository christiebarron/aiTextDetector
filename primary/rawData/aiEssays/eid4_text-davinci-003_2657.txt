At the end of ‘Winter Hibiscus’, Minfong Ho provides a reflective and inspiring conclusion to the story.

The image of ‘the geese returning’ suggests a grand sense of optimism that despite the cold, the passing of time will bring with it a hopeful and daring spirit to challenge the task and accept the results, whatever they may be. This idea of an ever-transient cycle of change brings with it the chance to try again, evidenced by the narrator’s own somewhat stoic attitude towards their own current predicament.

The successful blooming of the hibiscus is the neat bow on top of it all, for the quality of determination is echoed in the hardiness of the flower and its ability to brave the winter and come back in the spring. It serves as a reminder to the narrator their own strength and ability to cope, and their courage to take on their next challenge.
