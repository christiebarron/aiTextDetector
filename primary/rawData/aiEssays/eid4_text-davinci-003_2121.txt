In Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the protagonist of the story, Tenzin, is grappling with the idea of being displaced from her Tibetan homeland and taking a test to prove American citizenship. In the end of the story, Tenzin resolves to take the test again in the spring when “the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” This has a profound meaning beyond simply referencing Tenzin’s determination to take the test; it represents Tenzin’s understanding and embrace of nature’s cycles- an acceptance of life’s changing seasons, and an ability to persevere despite adversity. 

At the beginning of the story, Tenzin is anticipating taking the test and “practicing politically correct answers that would make America understand her.” She looks to her hibiscus plant, which has managed to survive through the winter, as a source of strength. She compares her own struggle for acceptance to the harbingers of spring that the plant represents - “In the cold, its leaves were limp, but there would be warmer days, and with them would come a flush of new buds and a hint of summer.”

In looking to nature and its cycle of growth, Tenzin finds a powerful metaphor for her own experience. Nature is resilient and cyclical, and by connecting her experience to it, Tenzin is able to come to terms with her own uncertainty and transcend her limitations. She begins to understand that life is full of difficult situations and moments of doubt,
