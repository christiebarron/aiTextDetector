Dear Editor, 

In a world that is dominated by technology, it is no surprise that computers have had an immense impact on our lives. In many ways, computers have made things easier â€“ they have enabled us to stay connected with people around the world, improved our access to information, and made our lives more efficient. However, there are some less visible effects that computers have been having on us as individuals.

As computers increasingly take over our lives, our reliance on them has had a serious effect on our ability to think and make decisions. We are increasingly used to relying on computers to provide us with the answers instead of coming to the conclusions ourselves. This can have a detrimental effect on our creativity and problem-solving skills.

Furthermore, spending too much time on computers can also have a negative impact on our physical and mental health. This can include anything from eye strain and headaches, to higher levels of stress and anxiety. When blended with a poor diet, lack of exercise and the long hours we are spending in front of a screen, the real risks of these negative effects can begin to compound.

In conclusion, while computers can offer many conveniences to our lives, it is important that we are mindful of the impact they can have on us both physically and mentally. We need to be conscious of the time we are spending on computers, and ensure we make time for other activities that help to promote our physical and mental well-being.
