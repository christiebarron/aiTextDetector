I remember a time when I was sitting in traffic on the way home from work. I was running late and getting frustrated by the amount of time I was spending in the car. I had to be somewhere very important that evening and the amount of time I was wasting felt like it wasn't helping. 

I suddenly noticed a homeless man on the side of the road and stopped to offer him a ride. He told me he was trying to get to a shelter and I offered to take him there. It was at least thirty minutes out of the way and I knew I was going to be even later than I already was. But despite the inconvenience, I held my patience and offered to help him out. 

The homeless man told me his story and thanked me for the ride. I eventually made it to my destination and accomplished what I had set out to do. Even though I had to practice a lot of patience that day, knowing I had been able to help someone else was a rewarding feeling.
