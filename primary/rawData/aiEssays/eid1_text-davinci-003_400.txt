Dear Editor,

I write to share my opinion on the effects computers have had on people, and to persuade your readers to agree.

Computers are amazing pieces of technology with the potential to improve our lives in various ways. By providing access to increased ideas and resources, computers not only aid in innovation and creativity but also open doors to creative and diverse career paths. Additionally, computers have empowered people to stay connected with one another from anywhere in the world, bridging distances that once would have seemed impossible. All of this sounds great, but there are also some unintended consequences.

Excessive computer use is linked to addiction, a decrease in communication and social skills, and physical health problems due to lack of exercise. Many children have become so consumed by computers that they have begun to forget the importance of interpersonal skills and face to face communication. It has even been suggested that too much time in front of a computer could lead to problems with self-esteem if we're constantly striving for perfection in a virtual world.

In conclusion, computers provide a great many benefits, but we should be mindful of the potential drawbacks. I urge everyone to use computers in a safe and balanced way, staying connected to the world around them.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
