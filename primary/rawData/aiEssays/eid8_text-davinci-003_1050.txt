I remember one day when my best friend and I went out together. We'd been through a lot together, had been inseparable since childhood, but she and I had recently grown apart as she had started dating and wasn't around as much as before. 

We decided to have lunch together, so I took her out to this small Mexican restaurant we both liked. We were both feeling a bit awkward and not sure of how to get back to our normal friendship. 

We decided to start talking about our school, our friends, and anything to just get some conversation going. After a few minutes, we started to talk about some of the funny things we had done in the past. I was telling her a story about how I had accidentally broken a window in my house a few days ago when I had been playing catch with my dog. 

At first, we just tried to contain our laughter, but eventually, we just couldn't help ourselves. We laughed so hard that other people in the restaurant started to look at us and had to leave the restaurant to stop making a scene. The laughter brought us so close together and we ended our time together with a big hug, no longer feeling the awkwardness we felt before.

That laughter made all the difference that day, reminding me why we were such good friends and how no matter what happens in life, it's always important to make time for friends and to simply enjoy life.
