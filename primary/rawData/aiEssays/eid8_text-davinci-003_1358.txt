I remember when my friend and I were in middle school, trying to figure out the 6th grade math problems for our homework. We both needed help, but neither of us wanted to ask our parents. So we decided to figure it out together. We spent hours trying to solve the few problems we had been assigned, and the more frustrated we got the more funny the situation seemed. We started laughing at ourselves and each other, trying to guess what the answers were while giggling in between guesses. Our laughter broke down the tension and instead of getting more frustrated we got more creative. We used every reference and technique we could think of until we finally figured out that last problem like some sort of Sherlock and Watson duo. 

That experience reminded me just how powerful laughter can be. It can help break down barriers, so we can work together more effectively. And more importantly, it can bring people together and make even the most difficult situations a bit more enjoyable.
