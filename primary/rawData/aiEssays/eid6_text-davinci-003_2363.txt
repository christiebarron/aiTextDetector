The Empire State Building was a revolutionary feat of engineering for its time. However, the plan to create a permanent mooring station for passenger dirigibles on top of the building posed a variety of obstacles to design engineers. In her book, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted gives a detailed overview of the difficulties that arose when incorporating the new mooring mast technology into the construction plans. 

The building's height and location made it an ideal location for dirigible docking. However, there were still several concerns. First, the safety of passengers and crew was of utmost importance. The winds that blow through New York are unpredictable, and engineers had to devise a means of safely anchoring the dirigibles onto the roof. To accomplish this, engineers proposed the use of a large steel mast, equipped with a series of cables and winches. This mast would extend above the roof and could be used to finely adjust the dirigible's movement and position. 

Second, the mooring mast also had to be durable. The Empire State Building is a busy hub of activity and the dirigibles had to be able to withstand the hustle and bustle of people walking and cars driving around the building. To ensure the mast could withstand the elements, it was designed with a series of reinforcing girders and stabilizers. 

Third, the mooring mast had to be accessible to both the dirigible crew and building occupants. For this reason, engineers installed two sets of stairs, one leading to a service platform and the other leading to the top of the mast.
