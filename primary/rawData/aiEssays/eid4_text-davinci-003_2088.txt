The last line of Minfong Ho’s poem ‘Winter Hibiscus’ is a powerful metaphor that reflects a moment of perspective and renewal. It is a reminder to the audience to value the beauty of life, which appears both in the form of a flower blooming in winter and in the process of repeating tests that are necessary for progress. 

The hibiscus flower is an apt metaphor for resilience and growth. Despite the cold winter season and deep snow, the flower manages to push forward and still marvel the speaker with its one of a kind beauty. This reminds us that even in a difficult and seemingly unfavourable situation, one can still find growth and remind us of how strong and powerful nature can be. The speaker’s choice to end the poem with ‘When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again’ encourages readers to recognize the beauty of resilience in the face of struggle and not be discouraged by the passing of time. Taking tests can be daunting, especially when we have already taken them many times, but with resilience, we can make progress in spite of our current setbacks or adversity. 

Moreover, concentrating on the hibiscus encourages us to take a break from our daily life and slow down to appreciate the beauty of something that has been growing in spite of the harsh winter. This can also be seen in other aspects of our lives. The poem concludes by urging readers to take a break, look for something beautiful amidst challenging times
