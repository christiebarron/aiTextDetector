The ending of Minfong Ho’s ’Winter Hibiscus’ is one of hope and a renewed dedication to perseverance. The narrator has their dream of attending college snatched away when their mother fastens the traditional foot-binding cloth for the winter, which prevents them from continuing their studies. However, the narrator finds hope come the spring when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds.

This hope is centred within the narrator’s promise to retake their college entrance exam when the snow has melted and the geese have returned; a determination to triumph in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. This pivotal incident the narrator witnesses, of a hibiscus blooming amid tired and grey winter sludge, serves as a reminder that winter will not last forever, and that their chances of achieving their dream to attend college will regenerate in the future.

The narrator’s resilience in the face of such a difficult situation is echoed in the excerpt’s final line, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It’s an inspiration to never give up on your goals, no matter how hopeless the situation appears.
