The setting of Joe Kurmaski's poem, “Rough Road Ahead,” consists of a steep hill and a winding road. The features of this setting directly affect the cyclist in the poem.

The steep hill adds to the physical challenge and difficulty of the cyclist’s journey. Furthermore, the steepness of the hill gives the cyclist something to strive for – he has to fight against the grade and find strength to gain momentum in order to move forward. The hill also creates a sense of urgency for the cyclist, as he strives to make it to the top before he runs out of energy.
