The construction of Empire State Building presented numerous challenges to its engineers, including the accommodation of dirigibles in its design. Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, in her book The Mooring Mast, notes the tremendous engineering feat that incorporating this accommodation involved.

In order to enable the safe mooring of the lighter-than-air dirigibles, the mooring mast had to be built to exact specifications. Firstly, to support the weight of the vessels and their corresponding mooring lines, the mast had to be strong enough to support the tethers and provide an anchor to safely attach them. Consequently, the mast was comprised of four diamond-shaped towers, connected by high tension wires enclosed in cable sheaths. The entire structure had to be assembled with precision to withstand the rigors of such a unique task, enabling the herculean ships to securely dock.

Additionally, with such a massive structure, the hazard of high winds presented a further challenge in allowing the dirigibles to dock. To prevent the vessels from losing control in strong gusts, the mooring mast was revolutionarily designed with enormous wind socks. These acted as a windbreak, measured the power of the gusts and enabled the pilots to measure their safe operating ledge without the worry of being blown off course.

Finally, the elevator systems had to meet the special needs of such a structure. Knowing the maneuverability of these vessels, the engineers put in an integrated system that delivered both passengers and cargo to the tower's observation deck. The elevator system was connected to sophisticated pulley systems enabling the dirigibles to move
