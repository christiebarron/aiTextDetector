I was working overnight stocking shelves in a grocery store when an elderly gentleman entered. I noticed he was struggling to reach things off the top shelf, so I decided to help him. I asked the gentleman if he needed assistance and he replied, “That would be very kind of you.” As I held an item while the man reached for it, I noticed he seemed to be laboring to make each move. I could tell he was in pain and could have easily become frustrated but he never said a single word. His patience was so inspiring. I ended up helping the man for a few hours and when we were done, he thanked me for my assistance, and for being so patient. It was an amazing moment that I will always remember.
