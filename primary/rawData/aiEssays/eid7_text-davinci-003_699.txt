I was at the grocery store waiting in line to pay for my groceries. As I looked up, I suddenly noticed the lines were much longer than I had realized. The cashier seemed to be going slower than usual. After a few moments, I could feel my patience slipping away.

Then, I decided to take a deep breath and remind myself that the cashier is just doing their job. I decided I should give the cashier the same respect I would want someone to give me. I stayed patient and understanding, quieting my voice and controlling my facial expressions. 

Rather than complaining and being negative, I instead complimented the cashier on the good job they were doing. This seemed to encourage the cashier, as they began to move faster. I even held the door for the person behind me who was going to leave after I had finished. 

In the end, I was grateful for the opportunity to practice being patient and understanding. I was glad I could turn a potential conflict into a moment of peace and positivity.
