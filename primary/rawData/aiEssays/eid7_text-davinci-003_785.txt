I was volunteering at the local animal shelter when I met a homeless man who was trying to find a home for his puppy. The pup had been living on the streets with him for the past few months and he had been struggling to find a place to take him. 

I asked him a few questions, mostly to learn more about the situation and I could tell he had been trying his best to provide for the pup. I offered to take her off his hands and bring her back to the shelter. He hesitated, telling me that he wanted to keep her. 

I could tell he wanted the best for the pup but was struggling to provide for her, so I decided to be patient. I took my time to explain the benefits of taking her to the shelter, such as access to food and other resources. 

Eventually, after about 20 minutes of talking, he agreed to drop her off at the shelter. To this day, I think of this man's patience and understanding when I have moments of doubt during times of struggle.
