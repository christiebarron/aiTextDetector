I remember when my friend and I were in middle school. We had been friends since kindergarten and usually got along really well, but there was this one day that was really hard. We were both really stressed out and making jokes just wasn't cutting it.

Suddenly, we both started to laugh. It was strange; I don't even remember what we were laughing at. But it released the tension in the room, and I felt like I could breathe again. We laughed until our stomachs hurt and tears were streaming down our cheeks. After that, we even managed to laugh about our stressful situation and find a solution together.

That moment reassured us of our friendship and I'll never forget it. Laughter is truly the shortest distance between two people.
