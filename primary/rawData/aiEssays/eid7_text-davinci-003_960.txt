I was running late for my flight and getting increasingly anxious. I was certain I was going to miss it, and the entire day was ruined. I was at the check-in counter and I could feel my panic rising as the airline agent slowly input my information into the computer. I tried my hardest to remain calm and patient, rather than lashing out my frustration on the person that was there to help me. When the agent finally looked up at me with a smile, I finally realized that it was not this person's fault that I was running late and that they were simply trying their best to help. I took a deep breath, smiled back and thanked them for their patience and understanding as they finished the process. I was relieved to find out that I had made it just in time for my flight. Being patient and understanding during times of crisis can prevent even worse things from happening.
