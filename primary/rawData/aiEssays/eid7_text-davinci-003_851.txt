I recently volunteered at a pet adoption event, helping out owners and potential owners with any questions or concerns they had. One of the visitors, Marian, had a few questions about the cats in the shelter, and I answered them all as best I could.

However, Marian was having a hard time deciding and seemed to be getting increasingly frustrated. She kept asking more and more questions about the cats, and I could tell she was having a hard time making up her mind. I knew it was a big decision so I didn't mind taking my time and answering all her questions. I was patient and understanding and allowed her to take her time, until eventually she pointed out a small white cat that she wished to take home.

The process of paperwork and paperwork finished just around closing time, and I told her she would need to come back the next day to pick up the cat. But Marian was worried that the cat might be gone in the morning and said she couldn't come back. I told her to wait and that I would stay with her until closing time and make sure the cat was still there. She seemed touched by my gesture of kindness and patiently waited as I finished up the paperwork and let her out of the shelter. 

True to my word, the cat was still there and Marian was able to adopt her without any problems. I was happy to have been patient with her and to see that things worked out in the end.
