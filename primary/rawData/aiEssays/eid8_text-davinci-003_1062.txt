I remember one time my family went camping in the summer. We had limited technology and entertainment, so one warm evening, my brother and I decided we'd try to come up with our own form of entertainment. After some serious brainstorming, we decided the best thing we could do was put on a sketch comedy show. 

We spent all night writing skits, coming up with ridiculous characters, and practising our jokes. We had a little crowd of my parents, my siblings, and a few friends from the neighbouring campsites.

The show started off rocky. I messed up my first few jokes, and my brother forgot his lines twice. We were about to give up, and call it a night, when suddenly something clicked. We both somehow started hitting our jokes perfectly, and the audience was howling with laughter. My parents couldn't stop smiling and clapping, and our friends were rolling on the ground with laughter.

I will never forget that night. We had so much fun, and no one will ever forget the sheer joy and endless laughter we shared. It was a moment that my family and I still look back on and talk about to this day.
