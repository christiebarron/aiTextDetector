The ending of ‘Winter Hibiscus’ by Minfong Ho encapsulates the idea of hope and resilience in the face of failure. The protagonist has twice failed a test, leading him to feel disheartened. Yet, the ending brings about an interesting juxtaposition of bleakness and hope.

The narrator’s focus on a hibiscus growing outside his window serves as a metaphor for this dichotomy. Throughout the poem, the narrator spends time looking at the isolated flower and contemplating its hardiness. Invoking imagery of snow, geese, and springtime, the narrator suggests that the hibiscus will blossom even when the odds appear stacked against it.  By implying that the narrator himself will take the test again when the hibiscus blossoms in the spring, he is projecting his own personal strength and resilience onto the flower, creating a powerful image of perseverance.

The idea of hope and strength in adversity depicted in the poem reinforces the idea that failure and difficulty are necessary components of life and personal growth. The presence of the hibiscus reminds the narrator that with endurance, even the most arduous challenges can be overcome.

Ultimately, this poem teaches readers that hope can still be found in the face of adversity and that no matter how hard the odds may seem, strength and possibility can always be found if one is willing to look. Hopeful and moving, ‘Winter Hibiscus’ serves as a reminder that life is ultimately about discovery, resilience, and growth.
