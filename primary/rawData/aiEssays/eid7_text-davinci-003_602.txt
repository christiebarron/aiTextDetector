I recently had an experience where I was forced to show patience. 
I was at the store and the person in front of me had a complicated payment process. I realized it was taking a bit longer than necessary and I was starting to get impatient. But I decided to take a deep breath and let it be. It's not their fault that the process was long and tedious. I just had to find a way to pass the time.

So, I just took some deep breaths and distracted myself with reading the signs and posters beside me. I also talked to the people around me, although there was only one other person in the store.

Eventually, the person finished with the payment process and I was able to go forward. I was relieved that the experience ended so soon, but I was also proud of myself for controlling my impatience. Despite the interminable wait, I decided that my own impatience was not worth feeling. In the end, I think I was rewarded for being patient.
