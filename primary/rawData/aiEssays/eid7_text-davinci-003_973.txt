I was recently on a long trip with a friend who isn't known for being very well organized. We had to take several trains and buses over the course of a few days and we had no exact itinerary of when and where each one was leaving or arriving. We had to find our way around a few cities and navigate through train stations and bus terminals, all while communicating in a language we both were not very familiar with. 

Throughout the entire journey, I had to remain patient and calm. My friend's lack of organization was a source of constant frustration, but I reminded myself that I should be patient in order to help him. I also reminded myself that it was very important to stay positive, despite the situation. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I took a few deep breaths and tried to stay focused on the end goal: reaching our destination successfully.

In the end, we both had a great time and our trip was a success. I'm glad I was able to remain patient, as I think it was the key to our success.
