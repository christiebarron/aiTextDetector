The ending of Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” has a deep symbolism that speaks for many who are searching for renewed hope and a chance for a better future. Throughout the poem, the narrator struggles with the fear and pressure of having to take an important, life-changing test. The ending of the poem speaks deeply to us of our perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds and that there is always hope for a better tomorrow. 

The winter hibiscus is a metaphor for the narrator and their quest to take the test again in the future. During the winter, the hibiscus is dormant but the narrator maintains hope that “they” will come back in the spring and their situation will improve. When the snow melts, the geese come, and the hibiscus buds again, the narrator believes that the future looks brighter. These words express the narrator's faith in the cycle of life and the idea that things are always changing, and that the future might bring fresh opportunities and challenges.

The message in the poem is especially poignant in today’s world, when all of us can find ourselves lacking the courage and motivation to take the next big step in our lives. We all need a reminder that things can get better and that we have the power to turn things around and make a difference in our lives. 

Ultimately, “Winter Hibiscus” speaks to all of us who are burdened by life’s difficulties and obstacles, and we can find strength and courage in the poem’s ending.
