I still remember that warm summer day, when my best friend and I had just finished our exams and decided to have some fun. We were walking along the beach, laughing and joking, when we saw two teenage girls draped across a bench, clearly trying to be cool. 

I thought to myself, why not? I gave my friend a mischievous look and started walking towards them, planning to surprise them and make them laugh. 

With a big smile on our faces, we caught their attention and started performing every silly dance we could think of. The girls seemed a bit taken aback at first, but it didn't take long before they started laughing and joining in. They were dancing with us, laughing out loud and before we knew it, time just flew by. 

In that moment I realized the power of laughter; how it could instantly connect two people, no matter how different they may be. That day we left with our cheeks sore from smiling and our hearts full of joy. This is an experience I will never forget, and I'm still laughing about it with my best friend to this day.
