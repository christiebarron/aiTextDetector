I was out with my friends at our local bar and I became a bit overwhelmed. We had been catching up on our individual lives, but all of the emotions and stories had started to weigh heavily on me. I noticed my best friend, Megan, watching me, and eventually she spoke up.

"What you need is a good laugh," she said. Immediately, she started telling a story—which of course had nothing whatsoever to do with any topic we had discussed—in a ridiculous voice and with lots of exaggerated gestures. She stumbled and fumbled her way through the story until eventually its jumbled pieces made sense and we were all laughing hysterically. I felt the tension from before evaporate away and the conversation become more lighthearted and fun.

Megan was the one who had the courage to lighten the mood and pull me back into the conversation. I was so touched and thankful for her kindness. Now, any time I am feeling stuck in an emotionally heavy conversation, I can rely on her to bring out the laughter to break us out of it. Thanks to her I've come to realize that laughter really can be the shortest distance between two people.
