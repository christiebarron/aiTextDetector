The setting of Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski plays a crucial role throughout the story. This setting is a long, scenic road full of curves and hills in an isolated, rural area. The cyclist in the story faces many dangerous obstacles while navigating the countryside.

The landscape of the setting is wild and unpredictable, but this also brings out a sense of adventure and exploration as the cyclist treks through the woods. This rough terrain pushes the cyclist to their limits, forcing them to use the full strength and agility to negotiate the treacherous roads. This is both a character growth moment and a physical challenge that makes riding on the lengthy, winding roads often risky, yet incredibly rewarding. 

The time of day plays an important role in the story as well, as the cyclist travels through the darkness of night. This adds an extra layer of danger and tension as the cyclist strives to stay safe in the unfamiliar landscape. The danger of the environment grows with each mile, and the sights and sounds become increasingly eerie and unfamiliar. 

The terrains of the setting cause the cyclist to become increasingly aware of the dangers that surround them. The roughness of the road does not allow for any distractions and the cyclist has to be alert
