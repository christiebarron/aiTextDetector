In celebration of the opening of the Empire State Building in May 1931, the American Society of Civil Engineers proposed an innovative concept for the building: allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. This concept, however, posed many engineering challenges, one of the main challenges being that a homemade mooring mast had to be built. The mooring mast was a very complex structure, and the builders were confronted with a series of obstacles in order to make the mooring mast work.

To ensure that the mooring mast could effectively serve its purpose of allowing dirigibles to dock, the mast would first have to be very tall and incredibly sturdy. To achieve this, the mast had to be a minimum of sixteen stories high, and it had to be constructed with steel and concrete to provide enough strength and stability. Moreover, the mast had to be positioned precisely on the roof of the Empire State Building, which was itself an extreme engineering challenge since the entire mast had to be assembled in a very confined space using specialized rigging, scaffolding, and cranes.

The mooring mast also had to be able to withstand the stresses of the wind and turbulent weather conditions. To keep the mast from being damaged or dislodged during harsh weather conditions, engineers outfitted the mast with a series of cables and lines that could be used to secure the structure in place. Furthermore, engineers installed several safety devices and safety protocols such as increasing the diameter of the mooring mast and installing emergency brake systems so that the mooring mast could safely deploy and retract in emergency situations.
