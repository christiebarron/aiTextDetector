The Empire State Building was an ambitious undertaking during its time, and the architects thought of all kinds of unique features and possibilities for its use. One of the most ambitious and talked about features was the possibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. However, when it came time to implement this plan, builders of the Empire State Building encountered a number of obstacles that presented challenges to the successful docking of dirigibles.

The first obstacle posed to the Empire State Building builders was engineering the necessary infrastructure and components. In order to facilitate dirigible docking, the top of the skyscraper would need to include a tall, strong mast to which the airship could be secured. Securing the airship to the mast would require the use of ropes and lines as well as sturdy anchor plates to which the airship could be attached. Furthermore, several specialized questions needed to be answered, such as how to account for the movement of the dirigible as it maneuvered in the wind and how to handle the mooring of larger dirigibles.

The second obstacle was ensuring the safety of the dirigible. Once the mast was constructed, the builders needed to ensure the mast could withstand the force and weight of the airship when it arrived. This was no easy feat, especially when the tallest mooring masts at the time were hundreds of feet shorter than the proposed Empire State Building mast. The builders had to create a special type of concrete, capable of withstanding extremely large weights, to help support the mast, as well as think of innovative ways to use the building itself, wind, and other
