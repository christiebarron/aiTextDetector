At the heart of Minfong Ho's poem "Winter Hibiscus" lies a metaphor of resilience and hope in the face of adversity. The poem is narrated by a young woman who, while studying for the dreaded TOEFL test, is confronted with an unexpected challenge: a frozen hibiscus plant which "shivers" in the frosty winter air. The woman is able to recognize an opportunity and grow resilience in the face of difficulty, found in the "living thing, so easily killed and yet so hard to destroy."

The poem's sweeping metaphor of hope and resilience is seen in the woman's newfound appreciation for the "difficult beauty" of winter and the unfailing strength of the hibiscus despite its frozen state. Moreover, the woman does not spend her time mourning her misfortune, but instead sees her situation as an opportunity to grow. By taking care of the hibiscus and helping it to "thrive" through the bitter winter, the woman recognizes the power of resilience when faced with difficult circumstances.

The poem elegantly draws to a close with the woman's realization that she too can harness this sense of resilient determination; when spring returns and the geese come back, when the hibiscus buds and blooms, she will take the TOEFL test once again. The poem's ending then allows its readers to experience a shared sense of hope and plenty of encouragementâ€”despite the challenges that this life brings, one can find ways to not only survive, but also to grow and to thrive.
