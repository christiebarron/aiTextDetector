I was volunteering at an animal shelter recently and I ran into a woman who was fostering a kitten for the shelter. We started talking and she told me about how she had suddenly become the foster parent of a very young and very scared kitten, who was not particularly friendly. She said that it was a bit overwhelming at first because she was so nervous about taking care of it, but she was determined to do her best.

Despite the kitten being so scared, she was very patient with him. She spent hours trying to get the kitten to trust her and eat from the bowl. She talked to him softly, and patiently waited for him to come around. When I visited the shelter a few weeks later, the kitten was contentedly purring on her shoulder.

It was amazing watching how patient and gentle she was with the kitten, and I think it was this patience that made it possible for him to come out of his shell and become comfortable in his new home. This experience showed me how a little patience can go a long way in improving the lives of animals.
