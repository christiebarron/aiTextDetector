I can still remember it like it was yesterday; I was a shy, awkward teenager, but excited for my first date. I was wearing my favorite outfit, a cherry red skirt and white blouse, and a pair of cute ankle boots. I went to the diner my date set up, feeling a bit nervous. As soon as I saw him, though, I couldn't help but smile. He had the sweetest smile, and it put me at ease.

When I got to the table he was already sitting, with a small bouquet of daisies waiting for me. We made small talk and shared a few laughs, but I felt myself getting more and more at ease with him.

Eventually, he made a joke about something silly and I began to laugh. I'd always been a bit self-conscious about my laugh, but it seemed to fit perfectly between us. My laughter soon became contagious and soon enough, we were both laughing so much that tears were rolling down our faces.

That night, I realized that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. Sharing that moment with him was one of the best experiences of my life, and it kicked off our relationship in the best way. That moment when we were both laughing together has always been special to me, one of the first of many happy memories.
