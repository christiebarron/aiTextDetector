The ending of Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” gives readers an uplifting sense of hope and possibility. To truly understand the significance of this ending, one must consider the context of the story. 

The narrator is a young girl whose family is immigrating to America and she finds the process of adjusting to her new surroundings both overwhelming and isolating. We see her struggling to learn English while also fearing that she will fail the tests necessary to gain admission to school. Ho captures the girl’s sense of insecurity by describing a hibiscus bush outside her window, which is a constant reminder of the warm and exotic place she has left behind. 

The ending of the story shifts the focus away from the anxiety of the young girl towards a new beginning. Her family’s hibiscus bush is described as being buried in snow, signifying that the dark and cold days of winter are slowly coming to an end. The narrator resolves to try her English tests again in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return. The imagery in the final line captures the girl’s resilient spirit and her courage to face her difficulties with determination and optimism. 

The ending of “Winter Hibiscus” is both cathartic and inspirational, and it suggests that with time and effort, anything is possible. The line “then I will take that test again” symbolizes the narrator’s refusal to give up against all odds. It also serves as a reminder that hopefulness and determination can help us all per
