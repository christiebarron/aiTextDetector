I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a beautiful spring day and I was walking down the sidewalk with my best friend. We had been talking about our plans for the rest of the week, and when we came to a crossroads I started to go one direction, and my friend the other. 

Suddenly, we both stopped and realized we were going in different directions. We shared a goofy smile and burst out laughing. I found myself doubled over, hugging my sides as the laughter reverberated off the buildings. Not long after, we were both howling with laughter, pointing at each other and clutching at our stomachs. I felt the laughter rising from my toes, so strong and warm it almost felt like love radiating outwards, binding us together. 

The moment lasted for what felt like an eternity, and before I knew it people were looking over in our direction. We eventually stopped laughing, but I couldnâ€™t shake the feeling of joy that stayed with me. It reminded me that even in the most unexpected situations, laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
