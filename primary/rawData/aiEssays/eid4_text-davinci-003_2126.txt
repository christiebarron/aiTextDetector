Minfong Ho’s ‘Winter Hibiscus’ is an allegorical story about a young girl and her grandmother's pursuit of an education. The story highlights the struggles of their life in Thailand and their determination to persist despite the odds. With the cold winter weather hindering their plans to take the university entrance test, the girl seems hopelessly resigned to disappointment. But it is only at the very end of the story, when Ho writes “When they come back in the spring… when this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again", that we glimpse a tiny glimmer of hope and resilience.

The author uses the image of the hibiscus flower to represent the young girl’s struggle to get an education. Just as the hibiscus is unable to bloom during the winter months, the girl’s attempts to take the test are stifled by their financial circumstances.

It’s a message that goes beyond the story: through education, anyone can reach their goals and break the cycle of poverty. The story provides us with an inspiring example of how courage and tenacity
