I recently had the opportunity to witness a great example of someone being patient. I was on a bus when an elderly woman boarded. As she slowly made her way down the aisle, it became apparent that she was having difficulty walking due to a knee injury. I could tell that the other passengers were getting a bit impatient as she moved slowly, but the bus driver made sure to take his time, waiting for the woman to make her way down the aisle before moving on. I was really impressed by the driver's patience and understanding. In the end, I think it made the woman feel more comfortable and confident as she made her journey. It was a great reminder of how important it is to be patient with others and to show them kindness and understanding.
