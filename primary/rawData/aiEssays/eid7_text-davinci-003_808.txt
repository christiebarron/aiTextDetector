I was recently at the doctor's office with my elderly grandmother to get her yearly checkup. I could tell she was nervous because the checkup was going to be a bit lengthy and she was feeling unwell. 

I was feeling a bit anxious myself. The doctor's office was quite busy, and we had already been waiting in the waiting room for quite a long time. 

My grandmother could have easily grown impatient as time went on, but she did her best to stay calm. Every time I looked over to check on her, she was just sitting in her chair peacefully looking around the room. 

Eventually, it was our turn to be seen. We followed the nurse to the examination room and my grandmother lay on the bed. The nurse asked a lot of questions, took her blood pressure, and performed the physical exam. Although everything seemed to take a long time, my grandmother stayed zen throughout the entire process. Even when things weren't going as planned, she remained patient and understanding. 

After the checkup was finished, the nurse offered my grandmother some water and asked if she would like to rest before we left. My grandmother thanked her for her hospitality, but politely declined as she was eager to get home. 

On the way home, I couldn't help but admire my grandmother's patience. I was so impressed with how she managed to stay composed and calm even during a stressful situation. Her ability to remain patient helped make the situation much more bearable.
