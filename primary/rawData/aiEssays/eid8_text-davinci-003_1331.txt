It was a chilly morning and I was on my way to meet my friend, Joe, for lunch. As I drove, I passed a group of kids standing on the corner, but I couldn't help but notice that they were all laughing. It was contagious; seeing their laughter filled me with a kind of warmth that I hadn't felt in a while.

Suddenly, Joe pulled up alongside my car in his bright yellow convertible and flashed me a smile. I couldn't help but smile back, and soon we were laughing together. His infectious laughter was like a ray of sunshine, warming me and comforting me in the same moment.

We drove to the restaurant and parked. As we walked up to the entrance, I noticed the front sign that said, "The Best Burger in Town!" I turned to Joe, who was still smiling and laughing, and said, "Oh, so you brought me here for the food, huh?"

The joke was so silly, but as soon as I had said it, we both burst out laughing. We couldn't stop, and before we knew it, we were both in tears. We held each other for a moment, embracing our silly little moment.

It felt great to laugh with someone like that - like no one else was around. I'd been so bogged down with the hecticness of life that I had forgotten how to just be, just laugh and forget. 

Our laughter filled the restaurant and everyone around us started to laugh, too. It was beautiful: a moment of shared joy, of connection and of belonging.
