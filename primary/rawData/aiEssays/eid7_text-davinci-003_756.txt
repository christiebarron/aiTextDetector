I remember the time I had to wait in line at the DMV. Everyone was getting frustrated because there were a lot of people and only a few people getting assisted. I could feel the tension in the air, and people starting getting short with each other.

At first, I was feeling the same way. I wanted to complain and lose my temper, but I took a deep breath and reminded myself that there was no point in getting mad. I figured that I was here waiting in line like everyone else, and I shouldn't take it out on anyone.

So I decided to stay calm and try to focus on other things. I talked to the person next to me in line, and we ended up having a really nice conversation. I also pulled out some work I had to do and started focusing on that, so I time went by quickly.

When I eventually got to the front of the line, I felt much better about the situation. I hadn't let my patience get the better of me, and I felt proud of myself for being so understanding and tolerant.
