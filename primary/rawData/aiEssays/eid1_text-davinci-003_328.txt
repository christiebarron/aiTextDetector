Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade the readers to agree with me. 

Computers have become a major part of many people's lives and have certainly had a huge impact in the way we communicate, work, and even play. They are a great tool for research, communication, and staying connected to friends and family.

However, I believe that if computer use is not properly managed it can have some negative effects. Increased computer use has been linked to anxiety, depression and difficulty sleeping. People may also become so focused on the computer that they neglect their family, friends and responsibilities. The fact that most computer equipment has a lifespan of only a few years means that people can waste a lot of money replacing old, outdated computers.

That said, I think the positive effects of computers still outweigh the negative. Computers have made our jobs more efficient and our lives more convenient. Theyâ€™ve allowed us to stay connected to our loved ones and to access more knowledge than ever before. 

In conclusion, computers can be both a blessing and a curse. We need to manage our computer use responsibly, so as to not let it takeover our lives. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
