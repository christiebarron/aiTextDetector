The Empire State Building has a long-forgotten piece of history. For the first two years of its existence, it was fitted with a docking mast to facilitate the mooring of dirigibles, or airships. This pioneering technology, however, was met with numerous technical and bureaucratic obstacles. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, The Mooring Mast, she examines the detailed events of the Empire State Building’s attempt to enable this revolutionary form of travel.

One of the major challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was accommodating the small size of the dirigibles. Even with a 200-foot mast erected on top of the building, the internals of the structure had to be modified to fit the needs of the ships, often at the expense of the occupants. To prevent damage to the mast, a winch was designed that could lift the cable, preventing the airship from slamming into it if the docking apparatus failed. Moreover, the design of the mast prevented airships from landing at the space within the structure, which meant that nearby facilities were often used instead.

In addition to the challenges of accommodating the smaller size of the dirigibles, the Empire State Building’s mooring mast was also met with bureaucratic red tape from New York State’s aviation authorities. Regulations of the time required that all dirigible landings, as well as the use of the mast, needed to be licensed and examined for safety, something that made it difficult for the Empire State Building to sustain the viability of its mooring mast as an airship
