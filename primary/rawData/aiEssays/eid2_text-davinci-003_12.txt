If libraries are to remain the ultimate sources of knowledge, then they cannot be afraid to make difficult choices by censoring certain materials. This is especially true when it comes to books, music, and movies dealing with topics such as racism, religion, or sexuality. By censoring these materials, libraries can help ensure that their patrons have access to accurate and comprehensive information.
