The cycling path the protagonist travels on is described as being an “old, narrow, and partially overgrown lane”. The path is rough, with obstacles such as rocks and deep ruts in the road. This makes it difficult for the protagonist to cycle along, and she is “constantly having to fight maintain balance, while having to switch gears frequently and contort [her] body in the saddle” in order to avoid the obstacles.
