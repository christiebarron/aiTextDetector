I had recently purchased a new digital camera and was determined to learn how to use it properly. I took a few practice shots, but I was having difficulty understanding all the settings. I decided to call the customer service line to try and get help.

The customer representative I spoke with apologized that they didnâ€™t have any experts available to help with camera settings and he offered to email me instructions. I was a bit frustrated as I was hoping to speak with someone in person, but I remained patient.

I thanked the representative and asked when I could expect to receive the instructions. He informed me they could be emailed within the next few hours. I thanked him again and said I would look out for them.

Sure enough, within a few hours I received detailed instructions and was soon able to take amazing pictures. After I was able to take a few great shots, I was reminded of the importance of remaining patient even when faced with a difficult situation.
