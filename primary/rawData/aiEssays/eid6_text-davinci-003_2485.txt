The builders of the Empire State Building faced a unique challenge when they sought to allow dirigibles to dock. With its iconic spire piercing the sky of Manhattan, the structure was unmatched in its stature, offering unprecedented views and a world of potential for entrepreneurs and sightseers. But scenes of airships arriving with a final flourish, their mooring ropes slipping over the mast that dotted the top of the building, were, unfortunately, not to be.

The technological demands and safety constraints of such a feat were considerable. The mooring mast itself had to be designed to withstand being hit repeatedly by the dirigibles, and had to reach a considerable height. But larger yet were the stringent municipal regulations that had to be met in order for a mooring station to exist. These intricacies and complexities of the time hindered the Empire State Building’s dream of creating a place where airships could pause and dock their passengers. 

The logistics of setting up a mooring mast on the Empire State Building were immense. First and foremost, the mast had to be sturdy and tall enough—it was required to stand 100 feet above the rooftop. Alongside this, the mooring mast had to possess an intricate web of cables that connected to the roof itself and the rest of the building, so as to stabilize the mast itself against the incredible forces of the airships’ winds. With such immense demands placed on the mast, engineers and architects had to create a design that was light, yet still robust enough to remain stationary when the winds of the dirigibles hit it.
