The process of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented significant obstacles to the building's constructors. In "The Mooring Mast," Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted provides details of the challenges that confronted this significant engineering feat, providing an inside view of the process from concept to completion.

To begin, the Empire State Building had to be structurally reinforced for the safety of passengers and passersby. In order for dirigibles to safely dock, the tower had to be strengthened, which presented a significant engineering challenge due to its height and weight. The builders had to take into consideration the effects of high winds on the structure and its ability to withstand impacts. The installation of the mooring mast also required the expertise of numerous engineers and architects, as the mast itself had to fit the design and aesthetic of the building and had to be able to handle the significant weight of a dirigible.

In addition to the structural considerations, the designers of the Empire State Building had to grapple with the unique navigational challenges of the mooring mast. By the time the mooring mast was completed, the crew of a dirigible had to negotiate the open waters of the lower East River to arrive at the building's rooftop. While the mooring mast offered a steady and secure point of landing, the crew of a dirigible had to possess a precise skill set to land the craft safely. To ensure the security of passengers, the mooring mast had to be equipped with specialized airbags to cushion the landing of the luxury airships that were to dock at the top of the building.
