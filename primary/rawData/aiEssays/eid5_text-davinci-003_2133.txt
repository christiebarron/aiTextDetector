In the memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez, readers are taken on an emotional journey through the designer's life and his formative years, which is characterized by a strong sense of nostalgia and sentimentality. 

The memoir is told as a series of vignettes, functioning as a way for readers to learn about the Rodriguez's family history and his childhood experiences. His family immigrated from Cuba to the United States, creating a unique duality in his own identity. Even though he neither speaks nor reads Spanish, Rodriguez connects with the raw emotions of his Cuban heritage. 

Tied to the feeling of nostalgia is an overarching sense of home, which is reinforced through Rodriguez's discussion of his family’s humble beginnings in housing projects, which later became their home. These memories are juxtaposed against his amazing success, which as he writes, “came with a realization that my life could be split in two.” These emotional juxtapositions create a bittersweet mood, as Rodriguez mainly speaks of his family and his success in a positive light. 

Ultimately the memoir’s core message is one of optimism, but with the wit to be reflective and conscious of both his past and his progress. As Rodriguez reflectively writes, “I know now that I’ve learned more in the past than ever before, while looking ahead.” This mixture of emotion creates an overall mood of appreciation, joy, and introspection that reflects the intersection of Rodriguez’s cultural heritage and his personal sense of success.
