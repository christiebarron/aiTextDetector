In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist must face the challenge of a difficult, rural landscape. This landscape is characterized by steep hills and long, winding roads, making it a difficult course to navigate – particularly when faced with the added challenge of racing against other cyclists.

The challenging terrain works to motivate the cyclist, pushing her past her own mental and physical limits. The long and winding roads demand that the cyclist have a great deal of stamina and focus, and the steep hills help to build endurance and challenge her level of strength. The cyclist is spurred on not only by her physical exhaustion but also her fear of being left behind her opponents; the familiar discomfort of an unknown and potentially unforgiving landscape serves as an added incentive.

The landscape also affects the cyclist in more subtle ways. The winding roads and steep hills force the cyclist to take her time and not rush towards her goal. As she navigates the course, she is taken out of her comfort zone as she encounters unfamiliar sights, smells and sounds. Like a blank canvas, this new landscape allows the cyclist to free her mind from her everyday routines, allowing her to experience something fresh and invigorating.
