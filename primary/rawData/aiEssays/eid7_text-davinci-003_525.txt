I recently had a situation where I had to be very patient. I had taken a new job at a large company and was getting used to the new processes and unfamiliar environment. One of my tasks was to fill out a large amount of paperwork. I had never filled out anything like this before and it was quite a tedious process.
 
My supervisor caught me getting frustrated and told me to slow down and take my time. He said he wanted me to take all the necessary steps correctly to ensure that we wouldn't encounter any issues down the road. So, I took a deep breath, took a step back, and tried to stay focused. I worked on it day by day, little by little, and eventually got all the paperwork submitted.

In the moment, I was quite frustrated and made a few remarks about how tedious it was, but I reminded myself to stay patient, since it was for the best in the long run. Even though it took a long time, in the end the process was successful and I'm now more confident in my ability to take on large tasks.
