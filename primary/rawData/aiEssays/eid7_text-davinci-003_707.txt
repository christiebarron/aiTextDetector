I was on my way home from work when I got stuck in a traffic jam. After sitting for almost an hour, I was beginning to lose patience. As I looked around, I noticed a young mom in the car next to me. She had her infant child in the car and was looking frustrated. But then, suddenly, I watched as she began humming to him and smiling. At first the baby was crying but soon calmed down and was smiling right back at her. I was amazed at how patient and understanding she was of her child's needs. It really inspired me not to get worked up over the traffic jam. I ended up arriving home with a much better attitude than when I had left work. The patience of that mom was a reminder to keep my cool in difficult situations.
