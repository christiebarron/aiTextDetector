Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people in our society today. Computers have revolutionized the way we think and act. They have changed the way we communicate, work, learn, and live our lives.

The increased use of computers has profoundly impacted our lives. Computers provide us with more access to knowledge, as well as making life and work more efficient. We can research and study more in less time, and access complex data quickly and easily. 

On the other hand, too much reliance on computers can lead to a decrease in creativity, critical thinking and problem solving skills. Researchers have noted a direct correlation between excessive computer use and a lack of basic skills, such as concentration and memory. Additionally, access to the internet can be a form of digital distraction, hindering productivity and mental focus. 

One key way to combat these risks is to remain mindful. The many advances in technology should be embraced, but it is also important to keep in mind the correlation between computer use and its potential implications. In order to succeed, we must remember to use computers as a tool and not an escape.

I strongly believe that computers can be a powerful tool when used responsibly and for the right reasons. Computers are enhancing our education system and helping us become more innovative, but only if we can embrace the technology, but also exercise caution.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name
