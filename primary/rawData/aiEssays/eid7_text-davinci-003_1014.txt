I was recently invited to my best friend's wedding. Everything about the wedding was beautiful and perfect, but was running behind schedule. Originally, the ceremony was going to start at 3:30 pm. An hour before the ceremony was set to begin, guests had arrived and were greeted with the news that the wedding would be running ninety minutes late.

At first, the waiting was unbearable and I noticed the mood of the guests start to shift. I was growing increasingly frustrated, but then I remembered that today was my friend's special day. I knew that he wanted everything to go smoothly, so I decided to do my part to make sure the day was as stress-free as possible.

I took a few deep breaths and chose to remain patient instead of getting angry or frustrated. I reminded myself that no matter how late the ceremony ran, the important thing was that my friend got to share this day with the ones he loves.

Finally, after two long hours of waiting, the ceremony began. It was worth the wait. My best friend was beaming with joy, and despite the late start, everyone was in a better mood because of the positive energy surrounding my friendâ€™s special day. The lesson I learned from this experience is to stay patient, because good things come to those who wait.
