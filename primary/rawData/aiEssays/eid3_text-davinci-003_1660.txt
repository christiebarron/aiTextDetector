In Joe Kurmaski's short story, "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting greatly impact the cyclist's journey. The cyclist decides to take the old route after a detour sign, which tends to signify a winding and difficult path. This is reinforced by the mountain view that is visible in the distance, adding to the anticipation of what lies ahead.

The cyclist moves further onto the old route, noting that the road is "worn and broken in places, with gravel spilling from the edges," and that it is narrow, overgrown with weeds and grass, and that "the dust rose up in clouds around [their] tires." This setting serves as a physical and psychological obstacle for the cyclist, as it gives the impression of a path rarely traveled that is unknown and possibly treacherous.

The cyclist's sense of determination is tested further by the difficult terrain and the intensity of the sun, which leads to sweat in their eyes, a reminder that the journey is far from leisurely. The path also becomes increasingly uneven, with rocks poking through the gravel and making it hard to cycle. Furthermore, the cyclist encounters a baobab, wild dogs, and a quiet village which are symbolic of the countless unpredictable risks
