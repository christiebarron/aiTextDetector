The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when considering the idea of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock from the skyscraper. The project was met with a variety of obstacles, the biggest of which was the inability for any kind of dirigible to make a safe landing onto the building’s top. The Mooring Mast, a concept proposed in the book The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, describes the challenges facing the builders in more detail.

The designers of the Empire State Building had to consider the size and weight of a dirigible, as well as how much of the building's top would need to be cleared for the craft’s mooring. This posed an issue due to the limitation on the size and weight of a dirigible’s landing pad. Furthermore, they had to acknowledge the fact that dirigibles would be unable to land safely onto the building’s roof as a result of factors such as wind speed and turbulence. As a solution, they proposed anchoring the dirigible onto a mast that was designed to be stable and secure enough to withstand the movement of the craft.

The Mooring Mast provided a perfect solution to ensure safe docking but was met with its own set of problems. Designers had to consider the height of the mast, as the higher it was, the greater the wind resistance and therefore, the greater the stress on the mooring. They also had to take into account the length of the mooring cable, as it needed to be long enough to accommodate a dirigible’s
