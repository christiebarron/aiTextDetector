At a time when our nation struggles with division and intense controversy, censorship in libraries has become a hotly contested issue. Fortunately, libraries are havens of free expression, dedicated to furthering knowledge, expanding horizons, and sparking thought. Censorship of such materials within libraries severely jeopardizes these goals. 

Books, magazines, movies and music are integral to many libraries, and they should remain unencumbered by censorship. Each library should continue to serve as a decentralized platform of free expression and ideas, unrestricted by judgments based on perception or values. It is ultimately up to the individual patron to decide which materials to request, borrow or purchase. 

Removing certain materials deemed offensive by some does a disservice to the individual by denying him or her the ability to chose for him or herself. This type of censorship sets a dangerous precedent in a society where freedom of speech is a keystone principle. It also calls into question the reliability of other forms of censorship, such as those employed by government organizations, when it becomes difficult to distinguish censorship meant to protect vulnerable populations from censorship that stifles voices for political, religious or economic gain.

Rather than imposing censorship, libraries should work instead to build a culture of educated criticism, where patrons are encouraged to exchange thoughts and opinions in an environment of mutual respect. If a patron is uncomfortable with certain materials, they can be asked to provide concrete evidence of potential harm or danger. In response, librarians should protect patrons by providing an education rather than censorship. Through education and debate, patrons can ultimately decide what works best for them and their own unique set of experiences and values
