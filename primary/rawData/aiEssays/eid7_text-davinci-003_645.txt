One time I was tasked with packing up an entire house. It was an overwhelmingly daunting task to undertake by myself. But I knew it was something I had to do, so I stayed patient and tried to stay positive. 

I started off slowly, taking things one step at a time. I decided to start with the kitchen, since that' was one of the bigger tasks. I spent nearly 4 hours that day organizing and packing up the cabinets, and I completed it with a sense of accomplishment. 

The rest of the day, I stayed patient and gradually worked my way through the rest of the house. I took inspiration from the successes of the kitchen and applied that same logic to each room. I kept chipping away at it, and eventually I finished everything by the end of the week. 

It was definitely an exhausting experience, but I was proud of myself for being patient and finishing the job.
