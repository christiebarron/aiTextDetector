I was recently helping my sister move into her new home. She had a lot of planning and preparing to do leading up to the big day and then, of course, the actual loading, packing, and hauling, which is always more time consuming and exhausting than you anticipate. The entire process was going pretty smoothly, until suddenly, on move-in day, we realized that the movers had put her refrigerator in the wrong room and it wouldn’t fit through the door. 

At first, I was really annoyed—we had so much to do and now we were going to have to figure out what to do with this enormous appliance, and how to get it out of the doorway. But then I remembered two important things: first, how long my sister had spent planning and prepping for this move, and second, that none of us had any control over the accident that happened, and none of the movers were intending to make the task harder. So I took a deep breath and decided to stay patient, and handle this situation as gracefully as possible. 

I asked one of the movers to help us move it, and with some work and cooperation, we were able to get it out of the doorway and into the right room. Throughout the whole process, I kept my cool and stayed calm and understanding and eventually, it was all taken care of without any extra stress added. 

It was a great lesson for me that sometimes, the best response to a situation is to stay patient and work together to find a solution.
