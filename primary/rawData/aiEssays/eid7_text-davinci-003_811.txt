I once had to wait in a long line at the grocery store with only one cashier working. I knew that I would have to wait for a long time, but I didnâ€™t mind because I was in no rush. I kept my patience, even when some people started to complain about how long it was taking. After about half an hour, the line had moved much faster and I was finally able to check out. I kept my cool and kept my patience the entire time. Overall, I was glad that I was able to be patient in the situation so that I could get my groceries without any fuss.
