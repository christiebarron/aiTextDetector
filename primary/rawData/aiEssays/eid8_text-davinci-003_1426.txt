I was out to dinner with my cousin last week when something funny happened. Something so funny that we just couldn't help but erupt into uncontrollable laughter. 

It was quite absurd. Everything was calm and peaceful until our waiter came out with an extra side of mashed potatoes. I guess he figured we'd both ordered it, but in actuality it was meant for the table next to ours. 

The other couple started to try and wave the waiter away, but when they realized the potato dish he was carrying was meant for them, they just had to laugh. And the more they laughed, the harder my cousin and I started to laugh. We couldn't help but join in on the fun.

The other couple's laughter was contagious, and soon our laughter was mingling both in sound and in harmony. We were all in stitches, finding humor in the most unlikely of places. Before we knew it, our dinner table had become the happiest it had been that night.

It's amazing how a moment of laughter can bring so many strangers together. That night, my cousin and I felt closer than ever â€” brought together by a laugh.
