I always knew my grandfather was a funny guy, but I have never been able to experience his sense of humor like I did the day we had lunch together. We decided to grab a bite at a cafe near his house and as soon as we were seated, things started to get interesting.

My grandfather started to tell me a family joke about two ducks sitting in a pond. He had a twinkle in his eye and was really getting into it. As he was acting out the joke, with his voice imitating the ducks, I couldn't help but laugh.

His eyes lit up and he continued to tell more jokes, each one funnier than the last. I had forgotten how much FUN it was to just sit back and listen to his jokes. As he was in the middle of another one, a waiter came by to take our orders. My grandfather stopped, but then started back up again, acting out part of the joke in a low voice while the waiter waited patiently. When he was finished, the waiter laughed too, and my grandfather thanked him for his patience. 

By the time our food came, we were both in tears, laughing so hard that I was sure everybody around us was looking. I had the best time, and the best thing was that nobody else laughed as much as my grandfather and I did, together.
