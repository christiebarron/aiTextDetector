In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting play a major role in shaping the cyclist’s experience and journey. The cyclist’s journey is mostly accompanied by a flat, deserted landscape, with low hills, small villages, and no end in sight. This stretches out far beyond what the cyclist is capable of doing, creating a sense of isolation, despair, and discomfort. The lack of civilization and civilization’s markers makes the cyclist feel more exposed and vulnerable, as she could potentially be lost for days before she finds help.

The physical environment of the road is also a factor, as the surface is extremely rough and prone to sudden rocks, creating an additional sense of danger, despite the cyclist’s best efforts to avoid them. The ever-unpredictable wind further creates a sense of unpredictability and fear for the cyclist, who finds it increasingly difficult to control her bicycle as the wind pushes her in every direction. Finally, the degree of difficulty increases with each passing minute, as the cyclist is met with endless, never-ending roads that challenge her physically, draining her of her energy, strength, and will to continue.
