The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' have a significant effect on the cyclist. The setting is an old logging road in the mountains, full of rocks, boulders, and other difficult terrain. The cyclist has to navigate this terrain, meaning that the cyclist has to pay constant attention to the road surface and adapt their riding to the constantly changing terrain. Additionally, the road is on a mountain slope and is covered in shale, making the road a very slippery surface when wet. The steep gradient of the slope also adds to the challenge, meaning the cyclist has to constantly battle against the force of gravity, making it difficult to keep the bicycle upright.

The cyclist is also affected by the lack of sunlight due to the trees covering the sides of the road. This lack of sunlight means that the cyclist has to be extra careful when navigating the road, as any mistakes are harder to see.
