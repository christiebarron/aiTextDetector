I was recently shopping in the grocery store when I noticed the line was very long. People began to complain about not being able to move forward, and it was only getting worse. I could tell everyone was getting frustrated. Despite the long wait, I decided to remain patient and wait my turn. After what seemed like an eternity, I eventually made it to the cashier.  As I made it to the front of the line, I could tell the cashier was thankful for me being patient and understanding in the crowded store. Despite my long wait, I was glad that I remained patient so that I could provide the cashier with a bit of kindness.
