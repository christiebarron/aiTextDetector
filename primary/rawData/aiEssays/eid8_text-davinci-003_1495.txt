I remember the first time me and my wife laughed together. It was our fourth date, and we had just started getting to know each other. Since we both have a pretty dry sense of humor, we had been getting along pretty well so far, but hadn't shared any uproarious laughter like some of my other relationships. 

We had just gone out to eat a fancy Italian dinner, and afterwards we decided to take a walk around the block. As we were walking, we both started laughing about something that we had talked about earlier. I can't even remember what it was anymore, but at the time, it was hilarious. We went from barely cracking a smile to an uncontrollable, full-on belly laugh. 

As we continued walking, we started making each other laugh more and more. We told inside jokes and shared funny stories, and it was fantastic. We laughed so hard, I had tears rolling down my face. We both felt so connected, free and light - so free of stress that we forgot all of our worries. 

I could instantly tell that we had a special kind of connection with each other. That first night of laughter was the start of something truly special between us, and I'm so thankful to have found someone who I can laugh with as much as I can with my wife.
