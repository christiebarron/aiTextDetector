I remember one summer, there were a lot of construction works happening in my street. It was noisy and there were always workers in the street with their machines and tools. 

Not only did it create a lot of dust, it also made it difficult for me to get around. But despite the inconveniences, I was patient.

I remembered my mom telling me to always be kind no matter what and to be tolerant even when things don't go your way. So I tried to be as understanding as possible.

I made sure to smile at the workers, let them pass when they asked, and tried to be friendly even while they disrupted my community. Even though it felt like a very long month, I was proud I was able to stay patient and courteous.

When it was all over, many of the construction workers thanked me for being patient and understanding during their work. It was nice to be appreciated and know that my patience had paid off.
