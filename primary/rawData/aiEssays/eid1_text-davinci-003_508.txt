To the Editor: 

In this rapidly advancing era, we rely upon computers more and more each day. Whether it's for our jobs, our education, or leisure activities, computers provide us with an easy and convenient way to get through everyday life. As it turns out, this might not be such a great thing after all. 

Recent studies have found that an excessive reliance on computers can lead to a decrease in cognitive abilities. Humans rely on computers to do things faster and more efficiently, which can lead to a decrease in our own processing speeds, as well as our problem-solving capabilities. 

The same study concluded that a decrease in cognitive functioning could lead to a decrease in creativity and innovation, as well as an increase in stress and anxiety. With our reliance on technology continuing to increase, these effects could be disastrous.

Thus, I believe that the effects of computers on people can be profoundly detrimental. It is important that we use these devices in moderation, and that we use our own minds---rather than computers---whenever possible. 

Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
