The monumental task of enabling dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building faced the builders with numerous difficulties. One of the biggest obstacles was the enormous size of a dirigible; these blimps were impossible for the men constructing the Empire State Building to ignore. In addition, dirigibles had extremely specific needs in order to safely moor, which meant that the builders had to take special measures in order to accommodate them. In ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author examines the issues that the builders faced when constructing a ‘mooring mast’ at the top of the Empire State Building in order to enable the safe docking of dirigibles.

To begin with, the Empire State Building was originally designed with the intention of allowing blimps to dock; however, due to the incredible size and length of the dirigibles, mooring at the top of the building had to be specially engineered. To make the dream of safe docking for dirigibles a reality, two masts were initially constructed to project above the rooftop of the building, but after seeking the advice of an aeronautical expert who had worked with dirigibles, it became clear that the masts were inadequate. He suggested that a single tall mast be built, and this was what the builders eventually constructed.

One of the major problems posed by the dirigible's size was that, despite the building's immense height, the length of any large dirigible simply could not fit onto the roof. To find a solution, a complex guide system was constructed around the mast
