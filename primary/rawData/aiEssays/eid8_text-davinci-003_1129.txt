I'll never forget the bonding moment my brother and I shared when we were kids. We were always competitive, arguing at the slightest provocation, and getting into legit wrestling matches when we were particularly fired up. We were in the backyard one evening with our dad and he was teaching us how to do cartwheels.

He showed us how to do it a few times, emphasizing the importance of getting our feet underneath us as we landed. We watched him for a few minutes and then started to try it ourselves. After a few misses, I nailed it in one try. I was elated and did a cheesy victory dance around the backyard.

My brother, who had been trying and failing for a bit, got frustrated and threw his hands up in the air. I had a natural athletic advantage over him because I was two years older. It seemed like he was a little bit jealous.

But instead of getting angry, he just started laughing. Even though he was failing, he could still appreciate me nailing it. Soon, I couldn't help but join in the laughter.

That was our "ah-ha" moment. We realized it was more fun to laugh at our failures together than to take them out on each other. From that day forward, we never fought quite so badly and we could always count on each other to make the other one laugh.
