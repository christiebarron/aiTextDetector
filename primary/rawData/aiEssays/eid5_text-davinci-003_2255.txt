The memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez is a powerful story of faith and family that captures the emotional narrative of the Cuban American experience. Throughout the memoir, the author conveys a deep sense of emotional connection and belonging that transports the reader on a unique journey.

Throughout 'From Home', a somber, reflective mood is created as the story traverses the author's past and present. His decision to leave his home of Cuba and move to America is one that is painful, yet ultimately beneficial and Rodriguez articulates this conflicting emotion of loss and joy with a grace and beauty. The words he uses to describe the close relationships and memories he shared with his family and friends back in Cuba, and the comfort that he experienced there, create an instant connection with the reader. This connection is further strengthened by Rodriguez's descriptions of the fear and apprehension he felt upon leaving Cuba, yet his faith that drives him to pursue a better life in America. 

This mood of sadness and fear of the unknown is juxtaposed with moments of triumph, joy and hope. When his mother's faith is spoken of and her unwavering courage in the face of harsh circumstances is celebrated, the reader is comforted with a faith-fueled optimism that, in the midst of adversity, life can still be lived with meaning and purpose. In conjunction with the memoir's inspiring illustrations, the vibrant colors of the Cuban culture that are so deeply steeped in family and faith are also powerfully captured, perfectly complementing the melancholic and uplifting mood of the story.
