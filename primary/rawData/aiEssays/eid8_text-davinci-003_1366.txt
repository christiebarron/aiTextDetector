I will never forget the time when my daughter returned home from college. She had been gone for a few months and it was great to finally have her home again. 

When she came through the door, I felt so much joy, but I was also overwhelmed – after all we had a lot of catching up to do! So, I pulled out a deck of cards and suggested that we play a game of gin rummy.

We settled into the living room and began to play, but it didn’t take long for us to start laughing and joking. My daughter was full of energy, stories, and excitement from college. As the game progressed, the talking and laughter grew even louder. We were laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces and we were having trouble focusing on our cards.

At one point, my daughter started to act out an anecdote she was telling and started doing a silly little dance. We both burst out laughing like we both hadn’t laughed in years. I think it was a combination of the release of emotions from being apart for so long, the joy of seeing her again, and her enthusiasm for life that made that moment so special. 

From then on, I knew that laughter would always be part of our relationship.
