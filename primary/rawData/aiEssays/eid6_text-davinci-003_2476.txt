The construction of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge in 1933. The plan was to incorporate the ability to dock dirigibles into the design by installing a massive mooring mast at the top of the building. However, the builders were met with a number of obstacles which threatened to prevent the installation of the mast.

In accordance with regulations set by the Department of Commerce, the builders of the Empire State Building had to prove the mast design was technically capable of supporting a loaded dirigible and provide acceptable safety conditions for the occupants. Additionally, the mooring mast had to be able to accommodate winds up to 40 mph and be rigid enough to prevent swaying in the wind. To meet this challenge, architects and engineers had to design the mooring mast to be exceptionally strong and have a smooth surface which would prevent the airships from snagging or becoming entangled in its rigging.

Another hurdle for the builders was the sheer height of the mast. At 200 feet, it was by far the tallest structure ever designed at the time. In order to ensure the mast could withstand the strong winds at such a height, they had to account for the fact that the winds would be much stronger at the top of the building than at ground level. To reconcile this, the designers not only had to make the mast incredibly rigid, they also had to accommodate for the fact that the mast would need to sway in the high winds, while still providing enough stability to ensure a safe landing.

As a result of these many challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a unique and difficult task. They had
