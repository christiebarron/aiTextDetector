At my job, I had been working on a big project for nearly a month. This project took up a lot of time and I felt very pressured to make sure it was done correctly. One day, I realized I had forgotten to include a certain element that needed to be included. Instead of panicking, I took a step back and was patient with the situation. I reviewed the project, paying extra close attention to each and every detail. With the help of my coworkers, I was able to make sure that the project was completed correctly and on time. This experience taught me how important it is to remain patient. By taking a few deep breaths and taking the time to review my work, I was able to be successful.
