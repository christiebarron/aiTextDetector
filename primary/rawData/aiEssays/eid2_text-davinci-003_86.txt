The issue of censorship in libraries is one that has been around for centuries, and the conflict between community members, librarians, and politicians is still very real. The right of individuals to access materials that are deemed “offensive” is under scrutiny, and it is important to express the significance of preserving this right throughout our nation’s libraries. 

The American Library Association (ALA) has long held the belief that access to information should never be restricted because it is deemed personally offensive. They believe that individuals have the freedom to seek out and evaluate their own material. Furthermore, the ALA states that it is not the place of libraries to act as moral censors over which materials an individual can access.

The limitation of the content that libraries are able to provide does nothing but harm our communities. By restricting certain materials, libraries are removing the ability for individuals to make their own decisions and form their own viewpoints. It is true that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, are considered offensive by some. However, it is important to understand that by censoring them, we would be hindering access to this valuable material which could offer a great amount of insight and knowledge to members of our community.

The materials which are deemed offensive should not be removed from the shelves but rather given a rating or tag which would alert people to the content before they decide to access it. It is up to individuals to determine what they are comfortable with viewing or reading and libraries should not participate in denying an individual of their right to do so.
