I once worked with a customer who, due to a disability, took a long time to explain the details of their request. Each time I spoke with them, I could tell that it was difficult for them to articulate their thoughts and I found myself wanting to rush them to get the conversation finished. I reminded myself that it was not my place to push them and instead, I tried to be patient. 

I changed my focus to listening carefully, allowing them to take their time and ask questions when needed. I found that by remaining patient, I was ultimately able to understand their needs better and provide a higher quality of service. As the customer noted my attentiveness, they became more comfortable expressing themselves and we were actually able to establish a positive relationship. 

Patience paid off, and I think the customer was grateful to be understood and respected. This experience taught me the importance of taking the time to be patient with someone even in difficult or challenging situations.
