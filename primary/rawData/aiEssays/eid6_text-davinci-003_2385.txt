The Empire State Building had always been a towering symbol of America’s ingenuity and ambition, and the dream of dirigible airships being able to dock atop its mast became a reality for a brief period of time. Despite this accomplishment, the builders of the Empire State Building did not just anticipate and accept the challenges of allowing dirigibles to dock on the building without first considering the serious obstacles that were present.

The 1930s were an uncertain time for aircraft, with the public still reeling from a massive explosion of the Hindenburg two years prior. This explosion shook public confidence in the safety of dirigibles, and thus the builders of the Empire State Building had a difficult task of showing that docking at their building was safe. Safety precautions had to be carefully thought out and implemented to ensure that the docking rigs wouldn’t create any potential shrapnel or flying debris that could ignite another disaster. This was of utmost importance, as the Empire State Building often had people in or around the area when aircraft were attempting to dock.

Another obstacle that had to be overcome was the Empire State Building’s own design. Due to its thin profile, the building was built with a shallow angled roof that did not leave much room for dirigibles to maneuver. This meant that airships had to approach the area at a low angle of descent and with minimal speed, making it more difficult for the pilots to maneuver. In order to make docking possible, the builders had to install a new 38 foot mast atop the building, as well as a powerful searchlight to aid the pilots in their navigation.

Finally, the
