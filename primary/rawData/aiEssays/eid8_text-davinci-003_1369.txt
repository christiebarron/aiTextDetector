I recently went on a blind date with someone who had been recommended to me by a friend. I was nervous, but I wanted to give it a try.

At the restaurant, I chose a table in the corner and ordered my usual. I felt my palms sweaty, but this guy seemed friendly enough when I first met him. We began talking about our jobs, where we had grown up, and common interests. 

The conversation ended up being pretty interesting and I started to relax a little. I decided to take a chance and told him a joke that I had heard recently. I wasnâ€™t sure how he would react, but to my delight, he started laughing. His laugh was contagious and I soon found myself laughing along with him.

The atmosphere changed after that, and our conversation became easy and light-hearted. We talked for hours and completely lost track of time. He ended up being a really nice person and we had a really great time.

Laughter may be the shortest distance between two people, but it certainly opened the door to a great connection that day.
