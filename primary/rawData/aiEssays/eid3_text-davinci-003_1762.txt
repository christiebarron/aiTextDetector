In “Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting of the story plays a major role in the cyclist’s journey. The first feature of the setting is the terrain. The cyclist rides down a long road of endless hills, with sharp curves, winding paths, and deep potholes. This makes the cyclist’s journey difficult, as he must navigate the obstacles in order to reach his destination. The second feature of the setting is the weather. With a rising sun and a hot wind pushing against the cyclist, he must find ways to keep himself cool and hydrated while also managing to push his bike uphill. These conditions make the journey even harder and more draining, both physically and mentally. 

The cyclist also has to confront the mental and emotional aspects of the setting. The long, winding road is a metaphor for  self-discovery and the need to push beyond boundaries. The hot and windy weather is a metaphor for difficult decisions and feelings of pushing towards an unknown future. By forcing the cyclist to confront these features of the setting, he learns to better handle the challenges and obstacles that life present—not just on the open road, but in other areas of life
