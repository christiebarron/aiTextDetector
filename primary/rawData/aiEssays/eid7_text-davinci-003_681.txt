I recently had the opportunity to observe an incredible example of patience. I was visiting a friend in a hospital waiting room, waiting for an update on a relative’s condition. The medical staff had been running late, and the longer we waited, the more agitated the people around us became.

One older gentleman began to grow increasingly impatient. He had been waiting for hours, and it was understandably taking a toll on him. He began to shout and complain, understandably frustrated.

Then, an elderly woman with a cane walked to the front of the room and calmly asked the nurse for help. She spoke with such respect and grace, it was remarkable. She had waited for even longer than the loud man, and yet she showed no frustration or anger.

The nurse immediately apologized and began to assist her. As the woman slowly made her way to the back of the room, I was astonished to see the agitated gentleman’s entire demeanor change. He had been paying close attention to the woman from the moment she asked for help, and it seemed to have a profound effect on him. He suddenly sat up straight, glanced around the room, and seemed much calmer.

This experience taught me a great lesson in patience. I will forever remember the woman’s power of poise and grace as she waited in a seemingly hopeless situation. She demonstrated that patience pays off, and it was truly inspiring.
