The builders of the Empire State Building were presented with a unique challenge when they were tasked with allowing dirigibles to dock at the building’s mast. Constructing the infrastructure to accommodate these massive airships represented a significant undertaking and presented a number of obstacles that had to be overcome in order to make the dock feasible. 

The main challenge was creating the physical infrastructure necessary to moor the dirigibles. The mast at the Empire State Building had to reach far above the building’s rooftop and provide a secure tie-off point for the airships. Secondly, the mast had to be sturdy enough to withstand the considerable strain of the airships. Finally, the dock had to be weatherproofed to ensure that the dirigibles were protected from the wind and rain.

In order to design the mooring mast, the Empire State Building’s architects had to reckon with the intricacies of airflow in order to ensure that the structure could withstand the buffeting of wind forces. The mast had to be designed in such a way that its shape allowed for a minimum of turbulence, which in turn would ensure that the lift of the dirigible would be unaffected. To this end, a curved shape was chosen for the mast because it reduced air resistance, thereby increasing stability.

In addition to its physical construction, the mooring mast also required specialized equipment to operate. A system of pulleys and cables was developed to provide the necessary lifting power to hoist the dirigibles up and make them secure. Furthermore, a series of motors, brakes and controls were installed to ensure that the
