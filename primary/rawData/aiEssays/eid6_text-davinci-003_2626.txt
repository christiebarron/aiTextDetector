The Empire State Building was conceived with a groundbreaking plan—to enable the docking of passenger dirigibles. Its construction posed numerous obstacles for the builders, and the the dream of using the Empire State Building as an airship terminus never came to fruition.

During the process of constructing the Empire State Building, the main challenge was finding a way to safely support the heavy load of steel girders that would make up the top of the building. The architects had to design a way for girders to hold the weight of an airship and its passengers, while also providing passengers with a safe platform to disembark. To accomplish this, the architects designed a steel frame of girders to serve as a “mooring mast” on the top of the building. The girders could then be securely attached to the airship's hull and used to support the weight of the airship.

In order to make the mooring mast safe for passengers, the architects also had to consider the hazards of strong winds and storms. To account for these, the engineers built a number of struts that reinforced the girders and provided additional stability. The engineers also built a series of pylons around the mast to provide further stability in the event of high winds.

Once these structural modifications were made, the architects faced an additional challenge—due to the size of the Empire State Building, any approach route for dirigibles had to be well-planned. The Empire State Building was significantly taller than any other buildings in the area, and the air currents around it could be unstable. To account
