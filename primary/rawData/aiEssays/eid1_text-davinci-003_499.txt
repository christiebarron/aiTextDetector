Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people’s lives. In this day and age, computers play a large role in our daily lives. From communication and entertainment to education and business, computers have made our lives easier in more ways than one. 

However, this is not to say that computers don’t have their drawbacks. We are more dependent on computers than ever before, leading to a decrease in creativity, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking skills. Furthermore, technology can lead to addiction, distraction, and isolation — all of which are potentially damaging to our mental and physical health. 

I urge readers to consider the positive and negative aspects of computers and to remain aware of their own health and well-being when using them. We should use computers as tools to help us in our daily tasks and activities, and not as a substitute for human connection, creativity, and critical thinking. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
