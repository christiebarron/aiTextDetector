I was recently at a crowded store on the weekend during the holiday season. The lines were exceptionally long and the cashiers were moving at an excruciatingly slow pace. Everyone around me was growing increasingly impatient and I could feel an air of tension building up all around me.

But, instead of getting frustrated and aggravated with the situation, I decided to choose patience. I reminded myself that the holidays can be a stressful time for stores, as well as for shoppers, and that I should practice understanding and tolerance.

So, rather than focusing on how slowly the line was moving, I decided to use the time to people-watch, listen to music and do some reading. I was surprised at how my level of stress decreased, but more importantly, I felt good that instead of adding to the tense atmosphere in the store, I was counteracting it with patience and a positive attitude.
