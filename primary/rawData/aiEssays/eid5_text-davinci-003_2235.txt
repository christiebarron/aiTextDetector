From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez. In this book, Rodriguez shares his story of coming of age in a Cuban-American family, looking back on his life and examining the influences of his upbringing on his work. The memoir reflects the struggles and triumphs of the designerâ€™s life, and creates a nuanced and emotional atmosphere.

The story is filled with the feeling of nostalgia, borne from the incredible detail in which Rodriguez remembers the people and places from his past. We can almost feel the nostalgia wash over us when he recounts the smell of freshly ironed laundry that permeated the small apartment or the emotional conversations about Cuban-American identity had with his friends at school. We become immersed in the story, as if it is our own. This strong sense of longing for the past is heightened by the constant reminders of the beauty and joy of Rodriguez's childhood. 

The memoir also has a strong air of homesickness. In this book, the author grapples with the constancy of his longing for the streets of his childhood and the duality of being both Cuban and American. The pain of Rodriguez's rejection of a sense of belonging to one place is palpable in his musings. He speaks of the complex emotions of belonging and belonging to two places, his childhood home and the United States. We can feel the tension between Rodriguez's longing for the lightness of his old life and the necessity to forge ahead in a new one.
