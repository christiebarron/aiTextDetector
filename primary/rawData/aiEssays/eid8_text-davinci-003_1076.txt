I was out for dinner with my long-time friend and former roommate, John. The conversation, like most of our conversations, meandered around all kinds of topics. We had both had a long and stressful week and were looking for some much-needed entertainment. So, when a young couple across the aisle began laughing uproariously over something, we were drawn in. We watched the couple from the corner of our eyes and couldn't help but smile at the genuine happiness they shared. 

A few moments later, the same thing happened to us. Our conversation had taken a silly turn, and we were laughing so hard that John started snorting, which only made me laugh more. I think the couple across the way noticed, because after our fit of joy subsided, we looked up to find them staring at us, smiling too. We all laughed together and shared a moment of pure amusement and joy. 

It reminded me of just how important shared laughter is in friendship, and I was reminded why I valued this friendship with John so much. We continued our conversation, but the conversation was a little lighter, and the laughter was a bit brighter.
