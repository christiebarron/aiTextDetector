I recently had a close friend come to stay with me for a few weeks. During that time, I encountered some difficulty in trying to make them feel comfortable and at home. My friend struggled with trust issues due to past experiences, and found it difficult to let down their guard.

At first I was cautious, not wanting to push too hard or move too quickly. I wanted my friend to feel safe and know that I was there to support them. I soon realized that the best approach was to just be patient. So I decided to take things slow, taking time to demonstrate my trustworthiness through spending quality time together, making sure they felt safe, heard, and respected.

It was a slow process, but over the weeks I could see the walls my friend had built around themselves slowly coming down. They opened up and we had some thought-provoking conversations about our shared experiences and reflected on some of their fears and obstacles.

In the end, my patience and willingness to invest in my friend was rewarded. We both left with a greater understanding for each other and a closer bond. Patience was truly the key to unlocking a deeper level of trust, allowing us to form a deeper connection.
