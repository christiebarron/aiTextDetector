When the Empire State Building was built in 1931, the idea that dirigibles could dock at the top of the building was hotly debated. Dirigibles, also known as airships, are large balloons filled with a gas that is lighter than air and propelled by motors and rudders. The concept of its docking at the Empire State Building seemed impossible, but those involved in the project still sought to provide a mooring mast for the dirigibles. However, the numerous obstacles that builders confronted in granting a place for the dirigibles to dock made it a much more daunting challenge than expected.

The initial obstacle that builders of the Empire State Building had to figure out was how to design a mooring mast that could safely hold a large dirigible. It had to be sturdy enough to withstand strong winds and turbulence. The solution to this was to construct a trolley track system that would allow the mast to move in two directions. A giant steel cable, known as a “sky anchor,” was attached to the top of the mast. This cable was connected to the balloon and would help keep it in place.

The next obstacle builders had to overcome was the security of the mooring mast. As such a unique structure, the mooring mast was very vulnerable to attack. For this reason, it had to be made out of steel and other strong materials to ensure that it would be able to withstand both violence and sabotage. Additionally, lightening rods were attached to the mast to protect it from atmospheric electrical discharges.

The final obstacle was the challenge of getting the dir
