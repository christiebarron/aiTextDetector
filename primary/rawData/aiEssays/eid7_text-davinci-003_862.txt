I remember a time when I had to go to the DMV. I usually hate it because it always takes forever. But, this time I was determined to stay patient.

Being the optimist that I am, I got to the DMV hoping that the wait wouldnâ€™t be too long. Little did I know that it was actuall going to take over two hours! I was becoming increasingly frustrated since I had other places I needed to be. But, I was determined to stay patient and not get mad at anyone.

So, I sat down and decided to relax. I read something that I had brought with me and closed my eyes. I focused on the fact that things happen for a reason, and that I should just go with the flow. After about an hour of waiting, I got fed up and decided to take a walk outside and get some fresh air.

When I returned about 10 minutes later, I was still determined to remain patient. Little did I know, I had already been served!

Being patient does pay off after all.
