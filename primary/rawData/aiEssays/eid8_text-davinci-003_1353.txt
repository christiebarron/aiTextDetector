I was at the mall with my best friend, Tina. We had gone shopping but had ended up walking around window-shopping more than we had intended. It had started to rain and the mall was mostly empty now.

Suddenly, Tina and I stopped in our tracks. We had heard two men laughing loudly and were so taken aback that although we couldn’t make out their words, the sound was enough to get us laughing along. We couldn’t help ourselves, and soon we were both doubled over in laughter.

As the men walked past us, one of them winked and said, “I like your style girls, you’re a real start of something new here!”. Tina and I smiled, our laughter continuing, until it felt almost like the sound of rain pouring down around us.

That moment marked the beginning of our friendship, and it is a memory that I treasure till this day. Even the rain could not dampen our spirits, and it only served to fuel our laughter even more. It was like a spark had been lit, and it will be with us for many more years to come.
