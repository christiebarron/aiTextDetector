I remember when my daughter was going through her teenage years and had some pretty challenging behaviors. As a new mother, I was getting anxious and frustrated while dealing with her outbursts and tendency to be defiant. 

One night, I spoke to her firmly yet lovingly and calmly laid out consequences if she did not comply with our expectations. I saw the hurt look in her eyes and could tell she was struggling with something. My parental instinct told me to be patient and try to figure out the root of her struggles.

So I paused and instead of punishing her, I asked if there was anything she wanted to talk about. At first she denied there was an issue, but eventually she opened up and told me she was really struggling with her self-esteem following the end of a recent relationship.

I listened intently and without judgement and encouraged her to talk about her feelings. In that moment, I knew I had to be patient to help her figure things out. I made sure she knew she was loved and that I was there for her no matter what. We got through this together and I'm proud now to say that she has worked through her feelings and is a stronger person for it.

Patience was key in this situation and I'm so glad I took the time to be empathetic and understanding. It has helped me be more patient with her in other situations.
