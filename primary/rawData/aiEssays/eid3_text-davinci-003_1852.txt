The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski has a major impact on the cyclist. The characteristics of the setting—from the terrain of the path to the temperature of the weather—all affect the cyclist's experience and challenge.

The road the cyclist follows is described as being made up of “boulders, ruts, and other obstacles" that show that this is an arduous and dangerous journey. This difficult terrain makes the cycling experience more challenging, as the cyclist must navigate tricky sections and beware of any potential hazards. This challenge is compounded by the fact that the cyclist is alone on this path, making it more daring as there is no one there to watch out for him.

The weather conditions are also an influential factor in the cyclist’s journey. It is described as being a “hot, humid summer morning”, making the cyclist's ride arduous as they have to push their bodies harder in order to continue making progress. This makes the journey even more difficult, as the cyclist is physically drained, yet still has to concentrate on the difficult path ahead.
