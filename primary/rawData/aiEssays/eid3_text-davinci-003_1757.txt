In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting plays an important role in how the cyclist is affected by his journey. The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” is on a mountainous region, which presents great difficulty for the cyclist. The terrain is described as having “rugged hills, rocky paths, and steep switchbacks.” This presents a physically demanding challenge for the cyclist, forcing him to push himself beyond his physical limits in order to complete his journey.

The setting also presents a sense of mental challenge and hardship to the cyclist as well. The scenery is depicted as bleak and non-rewarding. The cyclist remains focused on fulfilling his goal despite feeling the “physical ache that pulsed around his core.” In this setting, the cyclist is presented with an endless amount of hardships that he must push through in order to reach his goal. This scene presents a sense of spirit and determination that is essential for completing any type of physical challenge.

The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” does much more than just present physical and mental challenges for the cyclist. It is also symbolic of the obstacles he must overcome in life.
