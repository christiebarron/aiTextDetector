 

I was out to dinner with my friend Jessica the other night. We were joking and bantering back and forth with each other, each trying to crack the other up. She asked me if I knew why chickens crossed the road and I had to think for a second before I responded with the classic, "To get to the other side!" We both started laughing hysterically. 

The thing about Jessica and me is that regardless of how hard either of us was trying to be funny, eventually one of us would inevitably crack the other up, and the laughter would go on and on. We just caught a groove and couldn't seem to get our laughter under control for a few minutes. 

The people around us were all giving us glances, but I noticed some of them were also hiding smirks and couldn't help but join in on our laughter. It was as if our laughter was contagious and everyone joined in. Overall, I had an amazing night with Jessica and we couldn't even finish our dinner because we were cracking ourselves up the entire time.
