I remember it like it was yesterday - the moment I finally managed to make her laugh. It wasn't easy, of course. She had been through so much in such a short time and had put up a wall between us. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't seem to break through.

But one day we were in her room, just talking. I decided to make a joke about something that had happened between us a couple of days earlier, and though I wasn't sure if she would even find it funny, much less actually laugh, I went for it anyway.

And then, just like that, she did it. She laughed. Not just a little giggle either, but a full on burst of laughter. Her smile lit up the room. In that moment I felt like I had finally succeeded in connecting with her, even if just for a little while. It was like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders.

That laughter was the start of something special between the two of us. And though the tough times were still to come, there were plenty of laughs along the way that helped us get through it. That moment will always be one of my fondest memories.
