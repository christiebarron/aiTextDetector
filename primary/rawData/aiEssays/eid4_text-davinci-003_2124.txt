Minfong Ho’s poem ‘Winter Hibiscus’ addresses a young student’s attempt to face her fears of taking a difficult test. Throughout the poem, the student finds solace from her struggles in a beloved hibiscus flower. The poem ends with the realization that, when the flower blooms again in the spring, the student will once again prepare to take her test. This hopeful yet foreboding conclusion speaks to the cycle of life and the inevitability of difficult test-taking. 

The student’s experience in the poem reflects the realities of many today. Even when faced with daunting tasks, such as a difficult test, life continues on. The poem captures this sentiment by noting that ‘when the snows melt and the geese return’, so too will the hibiscus flower. This brings to mind the symbolism of renewal and rebirth; while the hibiscus flower is a symbol of the student’s struggles, its presence can also serve as a reminder of hope and strength. 

In some ways, the poem reflects an ideal cycle of life. Once the snow melts and spring arrives, the student can continue taking her test with a newfound sense of determination and hope. This reminds us that life’s toughest moments can serve as an opportunity for growth and success. The student in the poem realizes this, acknowledging that ‘Then I will take that test again’. This line implies that despite the difficulty of the test, the student is not deterred and is ready to tackle it once more.
