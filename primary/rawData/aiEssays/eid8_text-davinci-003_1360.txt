I had been out to dinner with my friend for a much-needed catch-up. We were rehashing stories from our teenage years, trying to outdo each other with humorous anecdotes. We were laughing until our sides ached and regrets piled up about the shared secrets we dredged up.

At one point, I was recounting a particularly unstable episode of my teenage years and was struggling to catch my breath from laughter. All of a sudden my friend totally lost it. She laughed so hard she was shaking uncontrollably like a puppet on strings.

At that exact moment, our waiter walked by and must have thought something was wrong. He stopped at our table and asked if everything was OK. My friend, who was still shaking with laughter, had to take a few deep breaths before she could even answer him. When she did, I saw that his face lit up with a smile that extended from ear to ear.

That one moment of genuine, heartfelt laughter shared between two strangers was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. It created a connection that felt like it spanned centuries. When I think of it, I am filled with a warmth and a lightness of spirit that reminds me of the importance of true connection.
