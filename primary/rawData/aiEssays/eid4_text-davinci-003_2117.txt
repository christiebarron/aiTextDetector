Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is an amazing exploration into memory, perseverance and faith in times of difficulty. The story is about a young girl named Ying who is attempting to pass a test that will enable her to graduate from elementary school. The symbolism of the hibiscus is central to the story. In the harsh winter, hibernating in the snow-covered garden, the hibiscus provides hopelessness in Ying’s tumultuous world.

The story ends with the line “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This line is filled with hope. The flowering of the hibiscus to Ying symbolises new beginnings and the start of a new season of possibility. Despite a destructive winter and being away from the home filled with memories of her past, possibly evident through the mentioning of the geese returning, she still manages to maintain her determination to make something of herself.

Ying’s desperation to pass this test is evident throughout the entire story. She pushes herself to her limits, including staying up until 2 in the morning despite her exhaustion, to ensure she can pass it. It gives the reader a great lesson in hard work and resilience. Even against overwhelming odds, Ying never gives up on her dreams and chooses to persist until she is successful. 

Ultimately, the story of Ying is immensely inspiring. Her unending determination and resilience to never give up despite how impossible the outcome may seem is an admirable quality
