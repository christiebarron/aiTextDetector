The role of libraries in a community cannot be understated. They are institutions of knowledge, and are vital in providing access to information and a safe haven for education and intellectual development. Unfortunately, this reliance on libraries for access to knowledge and freedom of speech does not always translate into unrestricted access to everything contained within the shelves. 

There is a common misperception that censorship in libraries is an inherently bad thing, but there are plenty of cases in which it can be irrevocably beneficial. For example, in public libraries where access is free to anyone, display of certain books and materials may be considered inappropriate or offensive. As such, libraries should adhere to certain standards of decency that reflect the moral and ethical values of the community. Censorship in such cases is not only acceptable, but in some cases necessary in order to ensure that all patrons, especially children, can feel comfortable and safe being in the library. 

However, when it comes to limiting access to materials on the genuine grounds of freedom of expression, censorship in libraries is far more controversial. In many cases, even books and magazines that contain jokes or sensitive topics such as religion, politics or race can be considered a form of censorship. While there are arguments in favor of censorship for books that contain insensitive materials or promote potentially dangerous or hateful views, we must also consider the adverse effect it may have on those trying to access alternative or dissident views, or even just knowledge.
