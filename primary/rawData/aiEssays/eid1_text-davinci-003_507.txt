To the Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. While computers are very helpful and can streamline many processes, they can also have a negative impact on our lives if we allow it. 

Technology has become more advanced over the years and computers are now incorporated into nearly every aspect of our lives. We use them for work, shopping, communication, and more. The way computers are used has significant effects on interpersonal relationships. For example, it's become more and more common to text or email instead of actually talking in person or over the phone. This means that meaningful conversations can be lost and can harm or weaken relationships. 

In addition, computers offer many uses that take away from our physical health. We can spend hours on social media, video games, and surfing the internet without getting up or leaving our homes. We end up spending less time in outdoor activities, exercising, and socializing with friends. All of this can lead to depression, lack of motivation, and physical ailments. 

Therefore, it is essential that we understand the consequences of technology in our lives and the importance of maintaining balance. If we exercise moderation, computers can be a valuable asset without causing any long-term effects. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
