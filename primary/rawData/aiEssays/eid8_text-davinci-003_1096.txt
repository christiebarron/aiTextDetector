I was sitting in a cafe with one of my closest friends, discussing the events of the week. We'd each had a tough time and had been looking forward to this time together all week. As we chatted, we started to get the giggles, telling jokes and laughing out loud. Even though we had been feeling so low and down, just being able to share stories and have a giggle together made us feel so much better.

As time went on, people in the cafe started noticing us and smiling. Our laughter had spread happiness throughout the room.

It was at this moment that I stopped and thought to myself how important laughter can be in any relationship. It had lifted both our spirits and filled the cafe with an atmosphere of joy and kindness that I knew we'd both be cherishing for days to come.
