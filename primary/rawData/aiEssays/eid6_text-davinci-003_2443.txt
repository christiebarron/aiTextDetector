The construction of the Empire State Building provided a much-needed jolt to New York City’s economy in the early 1930s. Much of the enthusiasm and optimism surrounding the building stemmed from its attention-grabbing height and its potential to provide a docking station for an exciting new form of transportation—dirigibles. However, despite the enthusiasm and enthusiasm, providing a place for these massive aircraft to dock was no easy task. This essay will examine the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle the builders faced was that of physical infrastructure. The Empire State building was designed to be the tallest building in the world and that presented a number of challenges when it came to providing a place to dock a dirigible. The dirigibles of the day were incredibly large and the Empire State Building was never designed to support their size and weight at such a high altitude. The dirigibles were so large and heavy, in fact, that additional physical infrastructure was needed to provide a safe spot for them to dock. This infrastructure included steel cables, a landing mast, and a steel gantry system running along the top of the Empire State Building.

The next obstacle was a bit more technical in nature. To dock successfully, the dirigibles needed to be tethered to the mast using a Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was a device that consisted of a cable that was attached to either the dirigible’s mooring point or the Empire State Building’s landing mast. The Mooring Mast was a sophisticated and complex piece of machinery
