I'll never forget the laughter I shared with my friend. We were walking to school one day and both of us were having a tough morning. She was struggling to get out of bed and feeling overwhelmed about her upcoming tests and I was dealing with some unexpected stress about a project. The world felt heavy around us but we talked about the silliest things and it made us crack up.

It felt like the worries of the day just slipped away in that moment and all that was left was a lot of giggles and smiles. We kept talking and talking and soon enough we had made it to school. Instead of feeling bogged down in stress, we arrived in class in a lighthearted, joyful mood. The feeling of laughter conquering everything around us still remains with me today. I'm so thankful for that moment and the reminder of how powerful laughter can be.
