I was recently in the middle of a really busy day at work. My boss had rushed in and expected me to quickly finish a long list of tasks in a very short amount of time. I knew it was nearly impossible to do, but instead of getting frustrated, I stayed calm and patient. I put in extra effort to make sure the work was done to the best of my ability and got it finished on time.

My boss was very appreciative of the hard work and was impressed that I was able to stay so calm throughout the whole process. I'm glad I was patient in the situation, because it paid off and was the right decision in the end.
