I remember when I met my partner for the first time. We had recently joined the same club, and one our first events was a group outing to a comedy show. When I saw him nervously walking in, I knew we would get along.

We laughed our way through the entire show, finding humor in even the most mundane jokes. From laughing so hard, I was soon in tears. In that moment, I knew that this person was special, and we had an undiscovered bond.

Little did I know, we would become best friends and eventually a couple. Now, eight years later, laughter is still a cornerstone of our relationship. Every week we either go out to a comedy show or watch one at home. Our days arenâ€™t complete without at least a few minutes of laughter.

We may not have the perfect relationship, but every day, laughter helps us bond and stay connected. Whenever we need a reminder of how special our relationship is, all we need to do is share a laugh.
