I remember the time when I was about twelve years old, my mother had just started a new job. She was working long hours and often had to attend meetings, conferences and seminars in the evenings, so I was stuck at home with my little brother, who was only 8 years old. One day, my mom had been away from home for so long that my brother and I got restless and ended up starting a huge argument. I wanted to listen to music and he wanted to play video games. We were about to reach a boiling point when my mother suddenly arrived home and realized the situation.

Instead of getting angry, however, she showed remarkable patience. She simply asked us to take a few deep breaths, come to her and sit down, one on each side. As we calmed down and started listening to her, she explained that she understood how hard it was to stay at home when she wasn't around. She soothingly told us that her job was important and that we need to be patient, just like she had been while waiting for the meetings to finish. We listened to her and felt ashamed of our behavior.

Her patience that day taught me an important lesson about life, that it's ok to get frustrated and experience difficulty, but it's important to stay patient. Whenever I find myself in an uncomfortable situation, I just take a few deep breaths and remember my mother's story.
