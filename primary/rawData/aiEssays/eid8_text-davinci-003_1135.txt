I still remember it like it was yesterday. I was walking down the street to meet up with my friend, when suddenly I heard the most infectious, boisterous laughter coming from around the corner. Being naturally curious, I decided to investigate, and when I got there, I couldn't believe what I saw.

My friend, who I hadn't seen in a while, was standing there with another person - a complete stranger - laughing, smiling and hugging each other like old friends. It all seemed so out of place - who would have thought that two complete strangers would be so happy to meet each other?

My friend finally noticed me and immediately waved me over to join in on their merriment. I slowly but surely started getting drawn into their joyous state and before I knew it, I was laughing almost as hard as them.

It turns out that the other person was someone that my friend had been having a crush on for the past few weeks. I guess he had decided to go out of his way to establish a connection. All of this had combined with the natural joy and humour that we were both radiating off to create the perfect recipe for fun and laughter.

We ended up spending the rest of the evening together, laughing and sharing some of our favourite stories. Our friendship had grown even stronger and, looking back, I think it was those few moments of laughter between us that really sealed the deal.
