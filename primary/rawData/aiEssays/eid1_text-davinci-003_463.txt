To the Editor,

It is no surprise that computers have had a major impact on our lives and will continue to do so in the near future. From communication to entertainment and even education, computers are an essential part of our everyday lives. But is the effect of computers entirely positive?

I believe the answer to that question is complicated. On the one hand, computers can create countless opportunities for us. We can work from home, access information in a manner of seconds, and share our thoughts and ideas with others all around the world. On the other hand, however, too much computer use can be detrimental to both our physical and mental health. Unlike physical activities, computer activities can become repetitive and can cause people to become more sedentary and inactive, leading to physical ailments and potential health problems related to strain from excessive use.

Furthermore, the use of computers may be affecting how people interact with each other in the real world. We are so used to using computers for communication now, that it can be difficult for people to interact face-to-face. Also, being surrounded by a virtual world can decrease empathy and create a sense of disconnection from people around us.

Overall, while computers can present a great number of new opportunities, it is important to be aware of the potential negative effects they can have on us and to use them in moderation. After all, our physical and mental health should be our top priority.

Sincerely,
