The Empire State Building was a marvel of engineering when it was completed in 1931, but something even more novel was added to its design – the ability to moor and dock dirigibles. Although the idea was bold and groundbreaking, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in making this concept a reality.

The most challenging obstacle was structural: the building had to be designed in such a way that it could withstand the heavy winds created by a docked airship. This meant that extra-thick walls were built around the 102nd floor to provide additional support, and wind-resistant supports were installed to ensure the safety of the airship and its passengers.

Another obstacle was the technology that had to be installed in order for the airship to dock safely. In order to dock, the dirigible had to come to a complete stop and remain in the same position so that it could be securely moored to the building. For this to happen, the Empire State Building had to be equipped with a mooring mast – a steel pole – that would reach high enough above the building to make contact with the moored airship. A powerful winch and crane were also needed to ensure that the airship could be lowered and raised in a safe, secure way.

The third obstacle was a financial one. Funding the mooring mast was an expensive task, and it took a great deal of effort to find enough money to cover the costs. In the end, the developers sought sponsors to help with the cost of construction, and a group of prominent businessmen donated what was needed to get
