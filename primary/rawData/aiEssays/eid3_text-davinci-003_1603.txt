The setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" plays an important role in establishing the overall theme and tone of the story. In a rural area, the cyclist is assisted by a farmer who also gives him advice about his journey. The wide-open road, the rugged terrain, and the lack of amenities make the trip a challenging one.

The cyclist is directly affected by the setting in several ways. Since he is alone and must rely on his own resources to make the journey, the remoteness of the area makes it difficult for him to find help. Moreover, the isolation gives the cyclist time to introspect and reflect on the decisions he has made in the past and present that have led him to the current situation. 

The difficulty of the terrain also affects the cyclist. The ruggedness and poor conditions of the roads make the journey more challenging. The cyclist has to constantly adjust his speed and balance in order to keep from losing control of his bike. This makes the journey slower and more tiring, but it also gives him a greater appreciation for how difficult it is to travel in such an area.

The setting of this story is not simply a backdrop, but instead influences the experience
