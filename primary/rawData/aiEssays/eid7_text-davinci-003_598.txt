Last week, one of my good friends asked me to bake a cake for her daughter's birthday. She wanted a specific flavor so I went out of my way to find the right ingredients. However, I got home to find that I had forgotten to buy one of the crucial items! I immediately began to panic, but after taking a few deep breaths, I remembered my friend was very patient.

I called her up and explained the problem. Without hesitation, she said, “No worries, I will help you get what you need.” We both drove to the store and thankfully, the ingredients were still in stock. After purchasing the missing ingredients, I was able to bake the perfect cake for her daughter’s birthday. 

I am so grateful for my friend’s patience. Even though I had made a mistake, she was calm, understanding, and willing to help me out. Her patience and kindness made the process a lot easier and we celebrated a very special day together at the end.
