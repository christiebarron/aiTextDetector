The process of allowing dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building was a difficult one that involved overcoming a variety of obstacles. In her essay, ‘The Mooring Mast’, Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the various ways in which the builders of the Empire State Building had to address these issues in order for airships to land safely and securely.

One of the first issues that the engineers of the Empire State Building had to tackle was the fact that the skyscraper was not designed with this form of transport in mind. Therefore, the mooring mast—the first ever commercial docking station for dirigibles—had to be specially designed and constructed. The mast was composed of sturdy steel and designed to be tall enough to provide secure docking. However, the engineers had to ensure that it could withstand any collisions or adverse weather conditions.

The second obstacle was the height of the Empire State Building. The mast had to be built high enough for dirigibles to dock at a comfortable height. To achieve this, the mast was eventually mounted on top of the 77th floor, with the tip of the mast reaching 1,050 feet above ground level. In order to accommodate the mooring mast, the builders had to remove one of the observatories, a process which took additional time and resources.

The third problem was the lack of infrastructure. At the time of its construction, there was no existing network of pipelines, guide wires or other infrastructure that airships could draw on in order to dock safely. The engineers had to innovate and design new systems and connections in order to create a
