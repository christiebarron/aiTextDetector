I was at my cousin's house a few months ago, visiting family that I hadn't seen in years. We were all sitting around the living room and catching up on our lives. After a while, a story of mine got everyone laughing. It was a silly story about the time my sister and I accidentally locked ourselves out of our house, and had to climb through a window to get back in. Everyone was in stitches, laughing and trying to hold it in.

I noticed that my cousin had been really quiet the whole time. I asked him if he was ok and he just smiled and said he was fine. Then he started telling a story, and soon the room was filled with even more laughter. His story was about how he had been trying to vacuum his living room, but hadn't noticed that his power cord had become tangled around the legs of the coffee table. As he was unknowingly pushing the table around the room while vacuuming, his family and friends had been cracking up watching him.

It was such a funny story and everyone was in tears, myself included. It felt so good to all laugh together, it was like time had stopped and we were all in our own world. It was a moment that my family and I will always remember, and it made me appreciate the power of laughter and how it can bring people together.
