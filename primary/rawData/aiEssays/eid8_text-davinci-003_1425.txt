I was out with my friends last summer. We had been at a bar, and were now walking around town, enjoying the warm night air. My friends were joking and laughing, and I was in a really good mood. Suddenly, I saw a pigeon walking out of an alley. I had an idea and I said to my friends, "Oh my gosh, it's my ex-boyfriend" and we all burst into laughter. 

We continued to joke about it and I started walking over to the pigeon. As I approached, my friends were still laughing, so I went in for the proverbial hug, and I lightly wrapped my arms around the pigeon. Everyone was in hysterics and I couldn't help but join in on the laughter. We then gave the bird a proper send-off, wishing him a good life and thanking him for being there.

It was definitely a moment I won't forget. That night I was able to share a good laugh with my friends, and even though the situation may have been ridiculous, it was a lighthearted moment that I still cherish.
