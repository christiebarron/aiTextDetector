I remember a time in middle school watching our class put on a play together. I was excited to get to help with the production, but I had no idea that a huge challenge was about to arise. The day before the big performance, the stage broke. It was a mess and nearly everyone panicked. Everyone but one person - Ms. Davis, our drama teacher. With an even-keel demeanor and contagious calmness, she offered up solutions and told us we would be ok. She said, in a cool yet determined way, that we should “take a deep breath and be patient.” We worked throughout the night to repair the broken stage, and by the time the morning came, we had it all fixed. I’ll never forget Ms. Davis’ composure and her willingness to stay the course during a trying time. She showed us all that being patient goes a long way.
