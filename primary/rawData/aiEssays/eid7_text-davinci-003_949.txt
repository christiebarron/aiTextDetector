I remember one time when I was at the store, and the woman in front of me had a very confusing order. She was buying items for a birthday party, and had at least ten different items. The process was taking a long time, and I could see the growing line of people behind me. I felt my impatience rising, but I managed to stay patient. I reminded myself that everyone has to shop and that everyone deserves the same respect, no matter how long it takes.

Eventually the woman finished checking out and I was able to purchase my items. After the process was done, she thanked me for being so patient and understanding. I felt embarrassed, but also proud that I was able to remain composed and wait my turn without making a fuss. It was a good reminder of the importance of being patient and courteous, even when things donâ€™t go as planned.
