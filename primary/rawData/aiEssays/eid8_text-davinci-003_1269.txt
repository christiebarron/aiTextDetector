I was in my second year of college when I decided to go home for the weekend. Being away from my friends and family had taken a toll, and I craved their company. So I packed my things and made the two-hour drive.

When I arrived, my family was already gathered in the living room, chatting and catching up. I decided to join in the fun, so I plopped down on the couch next to my oldest sister. We began catching up on each other’s lives and soon turned to more lighthearted conversations. Before long, we were both giggling, and soon everyone else got in on it too.

It felt so good to share a moment of joy with my family. Our laughter bubbled over like a fountain for what felt like forever. We're still talking about it weeks later.

I'm so thankful for the special bond that laughter has formed between us. It’s probably the shortest distance possible between two people, and it was amazing to experience it firsthand.
