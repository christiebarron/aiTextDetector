 

I remember the last time I laughed with my dad before he passed away. We were sitting in the garden enjoying the sunshine. I had asked him what the best advice he had ever received was and he said "laugh at yourself." I thought this was such an odd response, so I asked him to elaborate. 

He started to tell me about a time early in his career when he was feeling overwhelmed with a task. He could feel the pressure building up, but he knew the best thing to do was take a break and not take himself or the task too seriously. Suddenly, he started to laugh uncontrollably at the situation he was in and at himself. He said it was the most freeing experience he had ever had.

Suddenly, my dad and I started to laugh in our garden. It was a deep, bellowing laugh that echoed in the stillness of the moment. As I looked into his eyes, I felt such a connection with him. Laughter had brought us together in that moment, and I felt so grateful for the memories we had shared. 

He passed away a few months after that day, but I will never forget the feeling of laughter shared between us. To this day, laughter still brings us together.
