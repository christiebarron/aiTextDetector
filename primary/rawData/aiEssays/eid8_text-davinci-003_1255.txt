I remember my first date with my now-husband. We had both grown up in the same small town but we hadn't known each other very well before this outing. When the night began, we were both rather nervous and awkward. We had some small talk and made a few jokes, but nothing really funny. Things started to change, though, when I asked him about his hobbies. He had a long list, ranging from playing the guitar to trying all sorts of unusual sports like mountain biking and rock climbing. I found all these activities fascinating, so I kept prodding him for more details.

It wasn't long before he had me in stitches. His stories were so detailed and animated; it was impossible to not laugh at the ridiculous situations he got himself into. He had an incredible knack for making me see the humor in everything and he seemed to enjoy getting a good reaction out of me. Before I knew it, the hours had gone by and we were laughing our way back to my parent's house that night. That was the night I knew he was the one for me. 

We've been together ever since. Our relationship has been full of laughter and fun over the years, and I can think back to that first night anytime I start to doubt our bond. Nothing brings us closer than a good-natured laugh.
