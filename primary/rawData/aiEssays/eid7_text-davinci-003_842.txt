I was recently on a road trip with my family and it seemed like we were always running late. We were supposed to be at our destination by noon but we kept getting sidetracked along the way. People in the car were getting frustrated and some were getting frustrated with my driving. I could feel my patience dwindling, but I stayed calm. 

When we finally arrived in our destination, it was 2:30pm. Everyone in the car was exhausted and no one wanted to continue on. But it was important for us to keep going, so instead of breaking down, I kept my cool and tried to get everyone in a better, more optimistic mood. I put on some music and turned the conversation to lighter topics, and eventually my family started to relax and enjoy the rest of the ride.

I believe it was my patient attitude that helped us keep going that day. I'm proud of how I stayed calm and positive even in a difficult and trying situation like this. Even though it was hard, I knew that the only way to get to our destination was to remain patient and level-headed.
