In Joe Kurmaski’s poem “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist goes for a journey on a seemingly treacherous and ever-changing road. The poem employs vivid imagery and symbols of nature to depict the cyclist’s journey across the different terrains, from rocky roads to sandy shorelines, from dark forests to dry deserts. These elements of the setting influence the cyclist's journey and create a sense of foreboding, as each change in terrain presents a new and challenging obstacle for them to overcome.

The bumpy and unpredictable roads of the poem create a sense of unease for the cyclist, as the rougher paths signify the difficulty that the cyclist might have to endure during the journey. The changes in terrain also make it difficult for the cyclist to plan their route, as they can find new obstacles less distinguishable in the darkness. Furthermore, the change in environment brings a certain psychological discomfort, where a fear of the unknown looms over the cyclist during their journey.

The darkness of the night also serves as a symbol of the fear luring in the background. The oppressive darkness shrouding the cyclist on their journey indicates the uncertainty of their path as they have no visualization of the unknown
