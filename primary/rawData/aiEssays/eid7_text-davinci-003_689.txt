Today I was shopping in the grocery store and there were a lot of people around. The lines were long and the cashier was going slow, but I was able to stay patient. Even though I was surrounded by frustrated and impatient customers, I was understanding of their situation and didn't let the lack of speed get to me. I knew that everyone was in a rush and that the cashier was doing her best to process everyoneâ€™s items in a timely manner.

I finally made it to the front of the line and, sure enough, the cashier was dealing with a particularly long, complicated transaction. I could tell the customer was getting anxious and, although I was anxious too, I just smiled and nodded at her as she tried to explain the situation to the cashier.

I finally checked out and, before I left, the relieved customer thanked me for being patient with her. It made me feel good to know that I was able to help her out by staying calm and understanding. Being patient can really make a difference in someone's day.
