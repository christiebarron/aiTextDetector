In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist is affected by the setting in a variety of ways. The cityscape of Philadelphia he is riding through is characterized by narrow, winding streets and cobblestone lanes which, despite providing a picturesque street scene, also provide a challenge for the cyclist. The tight corners, sudden inclines and short downhill bursts require great technical skill to traverse safely, increasing the intensity of the ride. Additionally, the cyclist is surrounded by the indifferent, yet looming presence of the bystanders—the cars, trucks, trolleys and streetcars—that fill the cramped thoroughfares of the city. The approaching sound of an engine is a constant reminder of the dangers posed by their presence, forcing the cyclist to maintain focus and navigate the course in a preemptive manner.

The cyclist’s physical environment is further complicated by the addition of unfavorable meteorological conditions. The wind, invisible yet forceful, serves to slow efforts and increase the energy expenditure. The rain that pours down in unforgiving sheets, further contributes to the bicyclist’s effort, endowing the ride with an aura of struggle and perseverance and adding to its intensity.
