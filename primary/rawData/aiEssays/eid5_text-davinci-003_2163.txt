The mood of From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is deeply reflective. Through conversations, stories, and childhood memories, and artistic choices like the color palate and photo layout, the memoir creates a peaceful and soothing ambiance. 

The memoir is compiled of narratives told in different time frames and featuring characters from different generations, linked together by a common thread of home. Although at times there are moments of tension, such as the importance that Narciso’s parents placed on his success or his struggles to fit in, overall the memoir creates a feeling of nostalgia, peace and tenderness for past episodes in the author’s life. 

The color palette used in the book - mostly various shades of blues, grays, and whites - creates an atmosphere of calm. Photos provide a glimpse of Narciso's childhood life and the days before his success. The small details such as the “donut table” Narciso was always drawn to as a child, and his mother’s creativity when it comes to cooking, only adds peacefulness to the memoir. The combination of words and visuals, with recurrent images of comfort and home, engages the reader with a hopeful and serene mood. 

Overall, Rodriguez’s memoir paints a picture of hope, home and joy in his life growing up, while emphasizing the importance of learning to build a life outside one’s home. By digging deep into the meanings of home, Rodriguez builds a bridge between past and present, that is both soothing and reflective.
