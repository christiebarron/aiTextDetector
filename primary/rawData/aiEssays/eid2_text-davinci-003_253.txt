Censorship in libraries has been a hot-button issue for decades. While there will always be two sides to the debate, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from library shelves simply because they are considered offensive.

It is the role of libraries to provide a free and open exchange of ideas. As such, libraries should reflect the diversity of their communities and should remain neutral on matters of viewpoint and opinion. Removing certain materials based on their perceived offensive content restricts the sharing of ideas and knowledge.

In addition, some materials might be considered offensive at certain times or in certain locations, but these thoughts or beliefs may not be shared universally. Books may portray people or situations that seem unacceptable to a particular group but may be welcomed by another. Such circumstances illustrate the need for an open dialogue about the material in question rather than a unilateral decision to censor it.

If a library is unable to make a reasoned decision about a material's controversial content, there are other alternatives available. Libraries can place materials with general content warnings or age restrictions. This can help library patrons to make informed decisions about what they find appropriate and interesting.

It is the responsibility of the library to provide materials in the public interest and to promote intellectual freedom. To take material off the shelves and censor it interferes with this mission. Libraries should embrace the full spectrum of ideas, whether they are deemed offensive or not, and trust in the public's decision-making abilities. To do otherwise would be irresponsible and deny people the opportunity to expand their minds and learn.
