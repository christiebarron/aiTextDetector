I was out shopping with my mom the other day when something extraordinary happened. We were waiting in line to check out and there was only one teller, so the line had built up. Everyone was getting frustrated, and the people near us in line were starting to grumble about how long it was taking and how inefficient it was.

I could feel the tension in the air, but then something amazing happened. One lady in line who had been waiting for a while started to talk to the teller, and she was so nice and patient. She asked how the teller was doing, told her that she looked like she was working hard, and even said that she was so grateful the store was open and she wasn't having to wait for an even longer time. 

The teller looked so relieved, and the other people in line suddenly softened up too. It was incredible to witness. I felt so inspired by this woman, and I wanted to show her my appreciation, so I thanked her as we left. 

It was such a great reminder to be patient in difficult situations and to be kind to each other.
