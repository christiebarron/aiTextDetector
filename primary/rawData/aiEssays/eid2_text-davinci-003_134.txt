The issue of censorship in libraries is a complicated and contentious one. Libraries have historically been a place where all forms of literature and information are open, free and accessible to the public. However, in such an age of heightened sensitivity and political correctness, libraries are now coming under pressure from some groups, who feel certain books and materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. 

As an avid reader and student of literature, I strongly oppose these efforts to censor library materials. I believe that the very mission of a library is to provide free, open and impartial access to information of all types, including information which may be considered offensive. Such materials should never be removed on the basis of censorship alone.

While I understand that there is sometimes a fine line between what is considered offensive and simply unpopular, I believe censorship of materials in libraries is both undemocratic and self-defeating. By censoring material and never allowing it to be seen by the public, libraries drain knowledge, opinions and understanding from potential readers. Removing access to valuable information from the public stands in opposition to the very idea of an open and free library. 

At the same time, censorship in libraries limits creativity and free expression. By never allowing certain ideas, topics, and materials to be viewed, literature loses its ability to explore, inform, and challenge. Denying people access to materials which might allow them to think critically and independently undermines their right to self-expression.

I strongly believe that censorship in libraries is not only the wrong approach, but detrimental to our education and understanding. Rather than removing books and materials
