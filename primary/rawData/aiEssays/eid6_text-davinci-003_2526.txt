The Empire State Building was designed to accommodate the docking of dirigibles, despite the complicated technical and engineering feats such ambition required. The team responsible for providing a safe and accessible landing spot for these large aircraft had to consider numerous obstacles in order to achieve their goal. 

The first obstacle was acquiring the necessary permits from the US government. The necessary documents had to be obtained from both the Department of Commerce and the New York City Building Department for the construction of the mooring mast. This took many months to secure, leading to additional delays in the construction.

The second obstacle was to meet the highest engineering standards for the structure to safely house the dirigibles. After the engineering plan for the mooring mast and airship dock area were approved, the engineers had to battle a myriad of physical limitations – lack of space around the building, and a 356 foot gap between the top of the building and the base of the mast – while still keeping the design aesthetically pleasing.

The third obstacle was the weight of the dirigible. The mooring mast had to be constructed with sturdy enough materials to withstand the weight of the aircraft. Special construction techniques and superior engineering years ahead of their time were needed to create a tower and a riggable roof frame to hold the airship, built using steel plates, steel beams and I-beams carefully riveted together.

The fourth obstacle was weather. The Empire State Building is located within the unpredictable precipitation and wind patterns of the city of New York. The engineers had to take into consideration potential wind shear and rain that may impact the aircraft
