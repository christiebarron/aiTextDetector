The process of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not an easy task. The obstacles facing the builders of the Empire State Building when it came to accommodating dirigibles were immense and diverse. 

The first challenge builders encountered when the idea for the mooring mast was first introduced was an engineering one. Building a platform that could safely support the weight of an entire dirigible and its passengers was no easy feat. Moreover, the size of a dirigible was much larger than a traditional plane, so the platform needed to be incredibly robust and stable. Furthermore, safety was a major concern when designing the mast, and features such as interior stairways and automatic elevators were installed to make sure people were able to safely disembark and board the dirigible. 

In addition to the engineering challenges, the builders also had to consider the practical elements of the project. Building and maintaining a dirigible docking station in the heart of Manhattan was no small task. The mast needed to be built with enough space surrounding it to prevent the risk of collision with other objects during takeoff and landing. Furthermore, the mooring mast also had to be easily accessible, so that passengers could board and disembark the dirigible in comfort and safety. 

The final challenge which the builders of the Empire State Building needed to overcome was finding an appropriate funding source for the project. Because the mooring mast project was costly and time consuming, the builders needed to find financial support to make the dream of a docking station a reality. Eventually, investors from several companies such as Airship Industries and the United States Navy stepped in
