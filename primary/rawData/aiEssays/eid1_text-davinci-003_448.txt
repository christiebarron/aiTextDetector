Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people in today's society.

In my opinion, computers have had a largely positive effect on our lives. They provide us with an amazing digital frontier that encompass anything from entertainment and news to education, shopping and more. For instance, computers give us easy access to endless amounts of information, allowing us to stay informed and up to date. It is also much easier to find and share content, create digital communications, utilize automation and get work done faster.

At the same time, computers have all but replaced traditional learning methods like books and lectures - learning how to use them is an essential skill in today's world. They also provide a way to safely store and easily access important data, provide entertainment opportunities and facilitate communication among people the world over.

Of course, computers have their downsides, such as invading our privacy and fostering addiction. People of all ages, especially the younger generation, face the risks of becoming too dependent on computers for entertainment and communication, possibly neglecting other productive activities. 

But anyone who has seen the many benefits these tools offer can see that these risks are outweighed by the multitude of positive effects computers have on our lives. I hope that readers of this newspaper can join me in recognizing the many merits of computers and support their use.

Yours very truly,

[Your Name]
