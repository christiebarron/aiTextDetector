Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact that computers have had on people's lives in todayâ€™s modern world. 

We all know that computers have brought many advantages, such as allowing us to bank, shop, and work online with ease. Computers and the internet have enabled us to connect with others, regardless of location, and to access knowledge, entertainment and so much more. 

However, too much reliance on computers has begun to take its toll. Our increased exposure to technology is negatively affecting us both mentally and physically. From my perspective, computers are slowly replacing traditional human interaction, meaning that people are spending less time engaging in meaningful conversations and activities face-to-face. 

I therefore encourage people to reduce their daily use of computers, to go outside and exercise, and to engage with family, friends and neighbors in the real world. Too much time spent in front of screens can have adverse effects on physical and mental health, leading to increases in anxiety, depression, fatigue, headaches and many other health issues. 

In conclusion, I would urge readers to consider their dependance on computers and to prioritize interaction in the physical world to promote healthy living and social support. 

Yours faithfully,

[Name]
