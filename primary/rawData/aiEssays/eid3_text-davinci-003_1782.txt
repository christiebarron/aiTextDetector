In Joe Kurmaski’s story “Rough Road Ahead”, the setting is a crucial factor in the cyclist’s success. He travels through a remote and unfamiliar area, a lawless wilderness full of dangerous people and wild animals. The cyclist's physical condition is constantly tested by the terrain uneven, the gravel roads pocked by potholes and topped with loose stones, and the sharp stones jagged and abundant. These features create a test of endurance, dexterity, and perseverance.

The cyclist is forced to travel alone and without any support, further increasing his difficulty. His sense of isolation adds to the challenge of his journey. Without the support of other riders, he must face the disorienting terrain alone. He must navigate the winding roads with no safe navigation points, leaving him feeling alone and vulnerable.

The cyclist is also vulnerable to danger from both wild animals and the lawless people living in the area. The sparsely populated wilderness is dark and full of hidden peril, and the cyclist must be on alert for any signs of danger. The absence of law enforcement and support can put the cyclist in a state of constant vigilance, further testing his physical and mental resources.
