I'll never forget the first time I laughed with my husband. We were out at dinner with my best friend and her husband, and the four of us were having a good time joking and talking about different things. All of a sudden, my husband, who had been relatively quiet up until that point, started to tell a joke. It was silly and he stumbled a bit on the delivery, but it was so endearing.

My friend and her husband were the first ones to laugh, and then, almost immediately after, I found myself joining in too. My laugh felt a bit silly and contagious, but it was genuine and something truly wonderful emanated off of all four of us in that moment.

My husband and I looked into each other's eyes after his joke and laughed together. That moment will stick with me forever, as it was the first time we shared something as intimate and special as genuine laughter together. It was a moment that really highlighted how close we had become since we starting dating, and I will always cherish that feeling of connectedness we experienced in that moment.
