I remember a time when my old car had broken down. I called a tow truck to come as I didn't have the money to get it repaired. The tow truck driver was late, and when he finally arrived, I was already becoming frustrated with the situation. 

However, I tried to remain patient and understanding. I opened the door and the tow truck driver apologized profusely for being late, saying he had another job to take care of first. I nodded and told him it was okay, even though I wasn't really thrilled about the situation. 

After he secured my car to the truck, he said he'd be back shortly and that he had to get some gas for the tow truck. I waited patiently for him to return, taking deep breaths and counting to 10 to help me stay calm.

Eventually, a half hour later the tow truck driver returned and I thanked him for taking the time to get the gas. Incredibly, he waved me off and said it was no problem.

This experience taught me that patience is often necessary in difficult situations. Although I may have been frustrated in the moment, I was able to practice self-control and come out of the situation with a positive outcome.
