I remember when I started my first job as a retail associate. It seemed like everyday I had to learn something new and I found it very overwhelming at times. I was nervous and insecure since I still had so much to learn. I was determined not to give up, so I decided to take it one day at a time.

On a particularly busy day, one of my customers became angry and refused to leave until I had found him what he wanted. It was a difficult situation, and I wanted to drop everything and walk away, but I stayed patient. I took a few deep breaths and remained calm while I searched for the item he needed. 

The customer was eventually satisfied, although I could tell he was still a little frustrated. I was relieved, yet I was also proud of myself for staying patient and dealing with the situation in a mature way.

At that moment I felt a sense of accomplishment. Being patient with difficult situations had reminded me how strong I was and that I could handle anything that was thrown my way.
