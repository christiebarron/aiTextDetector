I remember when my best friend and I were in fourth grade. We were walking down the hallway to our next class, when suddenly out of the blue we both broke into a full belly laugh. I had no idea what we were laughing about, but we just couldn't stop.

It was so silly and contagious. All the classmates around us started to join in and soon the whole hallway was filled with laughter. There was something special about this moment that connected us in a way I couldn't explain. We hadn't said a word to each other or even looked at each other, but we both felt the connection.

It was the power of laughter that broke down barriers. It made us feel closer than ever. We kept laughing until the bell rang and we had to go our separate ways, but that laughter stayed with us throughout the day and I will never forget it. It is truly the shortest distance between two people.
