I used to work as a waiter at a restaurant, and one night my shift went particularly slow. By the end of the night, I had only served a handful of customers, and the night dragged on. I must have been visibly frustrated, my coworkers and boss could clearly see it on my face.

My boss, Sam, could tell I had had it so he started to chat with me and told me to take a few deep breaths and try to stay in the moment. I did just that and adopted a more positive attitude. I slowed down my pace and found a sense of inner peace. I was able to be patient, and the night ended up going by quickly.

I was amazed by the power of staying patient and looking at the bigger picture. I reminded myself that it was just one shift, and that the slow night was out my control. With that mindset, I was able to stay patient and make it through the shift.
