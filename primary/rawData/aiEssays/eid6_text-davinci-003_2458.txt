The construction of the Empire State Building in the early 1930s posed unique challenges for the builders at the time, including the difficult task of allowing dirigibles to dock on the rooftop. "The Mooring Mast", written by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, provides insight into the obstacles faced in this endeavor.

One of the first obstacles faced by the builders was the limited space for the mooring mast. The mooring mast had to be tall enough to allow dirigibles to rise at the same level of the building, but also short enough to not extend more than eight feet above the roof. The team at the Empire State Building faced a challenge in finding a solution that allowed the mooring mast to be both tall enough to facilitate navigation and short enough to adhere to the eight-foot rule.

The second obstacle faced by the builders was the requirement to ensure the mast was able to withstand the wind and turbulence created by nearby buildings. Due to the close proximity of nearby skyscrapers, the steel mooring mast had to be reinforced with a series of guy cables to withstand the pressure of the wind. Additionally, the mooring mast required specially designed platforms for the dirigibles to land safely. This posed an additional challenge for the builders, as these platforms had to be securely attached to the mast to ensure the safety of passengers.

Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced the difficult challenge of the cost associated with the mooring mast installation. Although dirigibles had the potential to provide a revenue source, the cost of outfitting the Empire State Building with the
