The Empire State Building, opened in 1931, was an ambitious feat of architecture and engineering achievement. One unique aspect of its design was the ability to accommodate the docking of dirigibles â€“ lighter-than-air ships. However, numerous obstacles had to be overcome in order for this to be realized. 

The construction of a safe and efficient docking system for dirigibles presented a unique challenge. The first issue was the height at which the mooring mast was to be built. A mast of between 270 and 380 ft. had to be erected atop the building to facilitate secure mooring. Adding a new, 1,000 ton structure to an already-existing building was a massive undertaking. However, the superstructure proved to be up to the task and the mast was finally completed.

A major concern with airship docking was the risk of collision with planes. To reduce the chances of such a destructive incident, it was decided to attach the mast some 30 feet away from the end of the building. This allowed an automatic warning system to be installed which would alert the docking controllers of impending aircrafts. Lights and sirens were also utilized to signal the dirigible captain when it was time to release the mast and leave the dock.

The final problem revolved around the mooring mast itself. It had to be made of light enough materials that it could be lifted by the ships and yet strong enough to remain secure when attached. To meet these requirements, the mast was made of steel frames and lightweight aluminium alloy cladding. This design combined the strength of steel with the lightness of aluminium and proved
