The setting in Joe Kurmaski’s story “Rough Road Ahead” plays a major role in the cyclist’s experience. The vast and rugged terrain of the Arizona desert serves as the backdrop for the cyclist’s journey, and its features greatly affect her. 

The desert sun is intensely hot, making the cycling expedition even more grueling and difficult. The cyclist finds it hard to find respite from the sweltering heat, and it is a major contributor to her worn physical condition. The absence of shade trees is a minor hardship, as she is unable to take breaks in the cooling shade. 

The sandy, rocky path further adds to the cyclist’s struggles. The road is uneven, making it difficult for her to get her footing and balance. The landscape is somewhat unpredictable, with occasional loose stones shifting underfoot, creating an instability that adds to her discomfort and difficulty. 

The environment of the Arizona desert is harsh and unforgiving, exacerbating the cyclist’s suffering. But its features also aid her journey in some cases. The wind provides her with a cooling respite from the blistering heat, refreshing her and helping her push on.
