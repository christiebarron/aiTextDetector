I had one of those days that was so overwhelming I thought I might never make it through. I was running behind on a major research project at work, had a difficult conversation with a colleague that I was dreading, and had to go to the bank to pay bills at the very end of the day. 

I figured I'd have to take the rest of the night to get the project done, but instead, I decided to take a deep breath and power through the day. I used all my willpower to stay calm and focused even though I wanted to rush. 

At the bank, the line was so long I could barely stand it. Time seemed to be creeping by and as I waited, my frustration was growing. However, I was determined to remain patient and not add to the frenzy. 

The clerk was helpful and friendly, and eventually I made my way out of the bank. As I was walking to my car, I took a moment to appreciate the fact that I had been able to remain patient throughout such a difficult day. I'm proud of myself for not giving up and being able to conquer everything I set out to do.
