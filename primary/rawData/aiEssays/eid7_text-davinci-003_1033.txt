I remember a time several years back when I was volunteering at a soup kitchen. Working there was always challenging; we rarely knew how many people would show up for food, and it put a lot of pressure on our ability to make sure there was enough for everybody.

That particular day, the number of people who showed up doubled from the last time, and with our limited resources and no additional volunteers, we started to worry about how we would be able to feed everyone. With no time to think of a better solution, our leader quietly told everybody to just work as quickly as they can to immediately make enough food.

Despite the pressure, I could feel everyone around me remain patient and focused, no matter how chaotic the situation was. Everyone took the initiative to start helping out in whatever way they could, and within minutes everyone's areas of responsibility had been clearly outlined. I was still new to the experience, so I was assigned to ladling out portions of soup.

Despite the situation, everyone around me remained patient, courteous and understanding. Just a few hours later, we had managed to make enough food for everyone, even though our resources were limited. I could see how a non-patient leader would have created a very different atmosphere, but in this case, being patient was the only way we were able to make sure there was enough for everybody.
