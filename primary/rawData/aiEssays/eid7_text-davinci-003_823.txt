I was recently waiting in line at the store and the person in front of me had a lot of items and was not in any rush. I was in a bit of a hurry to get home, but I decided to put my impatience aside. I kept polite and waited patiently for the person to finish. I cleared my mind and tried to remain calm as I waited for the person to finish their order. After a few minutes, the person completed their order and I was able to move forward in line. Even though I had been in a hurry, I reminded myself that being patient and understanding is important, despite the circumstances.
