I recently had a car accident which totaled my car. At the moment I was really stressed out, everything seemed to be happening too fast and I couldnâ€™t keep up with all the paperwork required to take care of the situation.. The tow truck driver was really friendly and patient with me, he kept his cool and explained to me every step of the process. He even took the time to answer all my questions. Even though he had a lot of other customers to deal with and it was already late in the evening, he didn't rush the process. His patience made the situation more bearable for me and I'm really grateful for it.
