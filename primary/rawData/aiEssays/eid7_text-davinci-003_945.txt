I recently had a stressful encounter when I was shopping in a store. I was trying to find something I had seen online, however, the store did not have it in stock. The teller grew increasingly frustrated as I asked for help, and she began to become rude and impatient.

Finally, I asked her if she could check with someone in the back about the item. She sighed loudly and walked away. Reluctantly, she returned with the news that I was looking for. Instead of becoming frustrated or angry at her attitude, I simply thanked her and asked if she could help me locate something similar.

I was surprised when she began to be friendly and helpful, showing me around the store and finding alternatives. It was clear that my patience and understanding had made a difference in her attitude. I believe that by staying patient, I was able to diffuse the situation, and have a better shopping experience.
