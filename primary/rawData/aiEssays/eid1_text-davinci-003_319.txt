As technological advancement flourishes, the traditional methods of computation have gradually been replaced by desktop and portable computers. Computers have provided a great deal of convenience and efficiency in peopleâ€™s daily lives. However, it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of computers on people.

First of all, computers have reduced the amount of physical activity. By using a computer, people no longer have to burn as much energy achieving a formerly time-consuming task. Despite being easier and faster, this decrease in physical activity can lead to a lifetime of health problems, such as muscle degeneration or obesity.

Furthermore, computers perpetuate the habit of social isolation. They are known to encourage people to become absorbed by their own situation and limit the amount of meaningful conversations they experience. Without that human interaction, people can lose the pleasure of relating to one another, hindering their interpersonal skills.

Finally, computers are a major source of mental fatigue. The use of a computer requires longer periods of attentiveness, straining the user mentally. This can lead to the development of eye strain and headaches due to various visual conditions, such as computer vision syndrome.

In conclusion, the use of computers is both convenient and advantageous in many different aspects. However, it is undeniable that there also lies potential risks by using them as our primary means of computation. It is therefore up to individuals to refuse and prevent any substantial harm caused by computer use.
