Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a powerful, evocative exploration of identity, family and self-discovery. Through his heartfelt, intimate recollections, Rodriguez creates a distinct and melancholic mood that weaves together threads of longing, nostalgia and sorrow. 

The memoir begins with a reflection on Rodriguez's childhood in the Bronx, a place that is richly described in vivid scenes of the Dominican American culture in the '60s. To evoke the feeling of belonging that he once enjoyed with his strong community, Rodriguez imbues the story with pathos and warmth. He writes with tenderness and affection of his close-knit family, conveying both the joys of togetherness and the heartache of pain and hurt as his family slowly fell apart.

In each recollection of life in New York, the reader is quickly struck by the melancholy that pervades Rodriguez's writing. Whether he is describing his struggles with being an outsider, his failed relationships, or the death of his beloved mother, each incident is shaded with heavy sadness. This moment of sadness is further reinforced by poetic, lyrical statements, such as when he describes the Bronx as a place of "dilapidated beauty". 

As Rodriguez takes us through his life, from his childhood in the Bronx to his experiences with fashion and his adult life, he invites us to join him on a bittersweet journey. The melancholy and longing that Rodriguez creates with his writing creates a powerful and moving atmosphere, one that deeply resonates with readers as they reflect on their own stories.
