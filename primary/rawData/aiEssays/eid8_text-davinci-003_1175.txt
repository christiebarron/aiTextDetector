My friend had been struggling for the majority of the day and was really down on herself. I was really at a loss for what to do, but I knew I had to do something. So I decided to take her out to a comedy club, hoping that maybe it would make her smile again. 

The first moment we stepped in the door I could feel the energy in the room. Everyone in there was so full of life and seemed to be so positive, it truly put me at ease. When the first comedian walked onto the stage, I knew it was just what my friend needed.

No sooner had the comedian opened his mouth that the whole place was consumed with laughter. Of course, my friend instantly lit up and began to smile along with everyone else. I laughed and laughed, so much so that I almost forgot why I had brought her there in the first place.

The rest of the evening was filled with laughter for the both of us. We ended up staying for the entire show and left feeling so much lighter than when we came. As we hugged each other goodbye I was so relieved that our time spent at the comedy club had worked to make my friend feel better. 

The power of laughter really is something special, and that night was proof of it.
