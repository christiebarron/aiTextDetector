Censorship has always been a controversial issue when it comes to libraries. On one side, proponents of censorship believe that certain material should be removed from the shelves if deemed offensive, whereas opponents of censorship believe that patrons should make their own decisions as to what is offensive or appropriate for them. It is important to strike a balance between these two sides for the betterment of our libraries and the community at large.

I believe that censorship should be used only as a last resort in libraries, and that patrons should always be able to make their own decisions as to what they find offensive or appropriate. Libraries should always be trying to make materials more accessible, not more restrictive. By eliminating controversial materials, libraries run the risk of limiting access to valuable information and potentially becoming thought police. 

While censorship may be effective in removing potentially offensive material from the shelves, it should be used only in cases where the material is especially graphic or explicit. Libraries should also consider providing access to such material only for research purposes or for adults, similar to how many libraries provide access to R-rated movies. 

The library is a place for free expression and exploration. Everyone should have full access to the materials available in the library, regardless of its content. By censoring materials, libraries run the risk that important historical data, sources of information, and avenues of discourse could be eliminated. Instead, libraries should strive to provide access to a broader range of materials while making patrons aware of their own responsibility to make the best decisions regarding what material is appropriate for them.
