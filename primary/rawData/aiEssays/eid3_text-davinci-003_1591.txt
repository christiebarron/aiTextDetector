The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a major impact on the cyclist in the story. The setting of the story is a desolate back road in rural Oregon, the environment is overgrown and eerie, with moss-covered trees, mist-covered hills, and a river cutting through the darkness. The setting provides a sense of dread and suspense; it is on this road that the cyclist must journey alone through an unknown and potentially dangerous environment, relying only on his/her strength and courage.

The features of the setting also have a direct and powerful effect on the cyclist. The loneliness and darkness of the back road signal a certain type of challenge; the cyclist is forced to confront his/her fears alone, on an uncomfortable and uncertain terrain. The cyclist is also forced to tap into a new kind of power; the power of their own strength and resolve to keep going and make it through the dark road ahead.

The natural elements of the setting also present the cyclist with a certain amount of risk. The overgrown vegetation makes it difficult to see what might be lurking up ahead, while the river provides a physical barrier to progress, forcing the cyclist to find a way across or around
