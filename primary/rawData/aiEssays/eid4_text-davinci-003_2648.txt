Minfong Ho's poem "Winter Hibiscus" uses nature to illustrate a person's journey of self-discovery and potential growth. The speaker is determined to take a test, presumably in order to enter a school program, but is reluctant to do so until they are fully prepared.

At the beginning of the poem, the speaker describes the day they decided to try the test, but they were soon caught off-guard by a hibiscus growing in the snow. To the speaker, this was an unexpected but comforting sight that reminds them that if a hibiscus could manage to grow in such an unfavourable climate, then perhaps the speaker too had the power to overcome the challenges of life.

The poem ends with the speaker connecting their own potential to the unshaken courage and power of this hibiscus. They knew that winter would end and spring would come with its own set of new opportunities, so the speaker vowed to wait until this time of greater clarity and positivity to try their test again. 

This poem serves as a reminder of the power of nature and its ability to bring people closer to self-discovery and new beginnings. Despite the lack of favourable conditions for a hibiscus to grow, the speaker still had hope for themselves and their own circumstances as they trusted in nature and time to bring about a change for the better. Nature teaches us to remain ever vigilant and hope for the best, regardless of what life throws at us. This was the main message the speaker was trying to convey in the closing line of the poem.
