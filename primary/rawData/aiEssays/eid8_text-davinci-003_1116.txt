I remember the first time I heard my husband laugh. We had been dating for a while and I was beginning to fall for him. One day, we decided that we wanted to do something fun so we went to a local comedy club.

We got there early because we wanted some time to chat before the show started. While we were having a conversation, I noticed that he was looking off into the distance for a few seconds and then he burst out laughing. I had never seen him laugh before, just smiled and chuckled here and there.

At first, it startled me. But then I started to laugh with him. I thought to myself, “This is it. This is the man I want to marry.” We shared that moment for what felt like forever, just laughing and having a good time.

Since that night, laughter has been a foundational aspect of our relationship. Whether it’s playing an impromptu game at home or out on a date, laughter is always present. It keeps us connected and reminds us of why we fell in love in the first place. 

Some people think that laughter is just a side effect of having a good time, but I think the opposite is true. Laughter brings us together in a way that no words can. It’s a language of its own, and I cherish every time we share that language.
