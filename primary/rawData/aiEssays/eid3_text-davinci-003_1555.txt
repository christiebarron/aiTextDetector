The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” plays an important role in the story as its numerous features add to the suspenseful atmosphere. It is set at night, increasing the sense of danger with the darkness concealing any potential perils. The protagonist’s loneliness emphasizes this classically eerie element of the night, as he is the only cyclist on the road. Additionally, the deserted path gives off a sense of foreboding, as the reader can almost feel the protagonist’s fear of the unknown. The rain only intensifies this feeling, as the cycle of wetness and dryness creates a sense of unpredictability and makes it difficult for the cyclist to see where he is going.

The combination of all of these features creates an uncomfortable and intimidating environment, which has a noticeable effect on the cyclist. The darkness and his isolation mean that he is susceptible to danger, as he has no one to help him in case of an accident. This forces him to stay in constant alertness, meaning he is likely to go slower in order to avoid any potential risks. He must also focus on navigating the steep hills and slippery roads, meaning he has no time to think about
