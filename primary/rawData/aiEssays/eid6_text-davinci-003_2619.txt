The development of the Empire State Building created a unique opportunity for the use of dirigibles to dock there. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at their world-famous skyscraper. According to Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's "The Mooring Mast," these obstacles included designing a suitable mast, developing a secure mooring system, and constructing a terminal that could accommodate dirigible passengers.

The first challenge was to create a mast structure strong enough to endure the strong winds that buffeted the top of the building. It needed to be adequate enough to support the immense weight of a dirigible as well as its tethering mechanisms. To meet this challenge, engineers designed a long, solid mast of steel and concrete with a wide base that would provide a secure foundation. Further, the mooring system had to be sufficiently reliable so that the passengers could safely board and disembark the dirigible. Ultimately, the engineers devised an elaborate system of interconnecting pulleys, mounting jacks, and weigh-anks that could safely secure a docked dirigible.

The other major challenge was constructing a terminal for the passengers of the dirigibles. The Empire State Building already had four observation decks, but they needed to be retrofitted to accommodate the passengers disembarking by air. To do this, the builders had to develop a system of non-slip walkways and skylights along the exterior walls of the building, as well as enlarge the lobby of the building to provide an area to debark. In order to maintain optimal safety, the pathways
