Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is a powerful story that follows a young student, A-mao, who struggles with her feelings of inferiority after her family moves to America. A-mao is surrounded by classmates who excel in the classroom while she is left feeling defeated and frustrated. At the end of the story, she looks to a hibiscus plant in her grandmother's garden, which reminds her of home in Taiwan and gives her the strength and hope she needs to move forward.

The conclusion of the story is especially meaningful, with A-mao reliving the emotional moment she made a pledge to her grandmother that she would keep working hard and eventually succeed in school. In the final scene, she promises to “take that test again”, referring to an upcoming exam. A-mao draws strength from the winter hibiscus, using it as a symbol of her hard work and refusing to give up despite her difficult circumstances.

The winter hibiscus also serves as a metaphor for A-mao’s faith in herself. Much like the perennial plant blooming each spring despite the harsh winter, A-mao finds the courage to press on and stay motivated in her studies. Just as the winter hibiscus reminds her of Taiwan and of her grandmother, the flower also reminds her that she can overcome any obstacle, no matter the odds. It is this hope that carries A-mao to the very end, when she promises to “take that test again”, signifying her journey from self-doubt to determination
