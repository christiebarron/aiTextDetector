I was out shopping with my best friend when I spotted a pair of ridiculous looking shoes the both of us couldn't help but burst out laughing over. We couldn't even fathom why anyone would ever buy them, so we had no idea why they were hanging up in the store. We howled with laughter, holding our stomachs in pain while a few of the other customers looked at us in confusion.

It felt amazing to share this laugh with my friend; it made our bond even stronger than before. Even though we didn't know why the shoes were so funny, it felt so good between us in that moment. It was like a silly little moment of connection that we could always look back on. 

Our bond was never so strong as when we laughed together. No matter where we were or what we were doing, if one of us was feeling a bit down, we knew that if we looked silly or ridiculous enough, than the other always had the power to bring him or her back up with laughter.
