I've known John for what feels like forever, but really it's only been five years. We met back in college, which is when we both decided to explore our hobbies together - him photography, me being a theatre student. After college, we decided to go our separate ways and focus on our careers.

But no matter how far away we were, or how much time had passed, we always managed to find our way back to each other and laugh like nothing had changed.

One time, John and I decided to take a road trip together and check out some of the photographs he had taken of some of the sites along the route. As we drove, we chuckled and shared stories. Every so often he'd point out something particularly funny and we'd laugh even harder.

At one point, John pulled off the road so we could get a better view of the landscape. I got out of the car and stepped onto a patch of dirt. As soon as I did, I lost my balance and suddenly had dirt all over me and all up my nose. I started to laugh uncontrollably, John then joined in and we were both just laughing so hard until the tears started streaming down our faces. We laughed so hard in that moment that it felt like time itself stopped for us. 

We laughed for what felt like hours - truly without a care in the world. It was one of the best experiences that I've ever had, and even though it happened in that moment, it is something that I will never forget. It is something that made me realize how much laughter is important in any relationship
