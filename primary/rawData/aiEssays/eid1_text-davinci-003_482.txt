Dear Editor,

It is no secret that computers have become an integral part of our lives. From education to professional applications and communication, computers have revolutionized how we function as a society. However, this efficiency comes with a price; the effects computers have on people have become increasingly evident.

Simply put, too much screen time can be detrimental for our physical and mental health. Countless studies have revealed the extent of computer usage's impact on cognitive and social development in children. Computer addiction has also been linked to a greater likelihood of obesity, poor sleep, and lower general wellbeing. In adults, increased computer usage can cause eye strain, burnout, and reduced productivity, among other complications.

For this reason, we should embrace moderation when it comes to utilizing technology. It is important to understand that computers and other similar tools should not replace our real-life interactions and activities; rather, they should be used as a supplement to our existing lifestyles.

I believe that by placing more emphasis on safeguarding our physical and mental health, we can ensure that we benefit from the many advantages of computer usage without compromising our wellbeing.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
