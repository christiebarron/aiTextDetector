I remember one night, my best friend and I were walking through my old neighborhood. We hadn't been in the same city for a few months, so we hadn't seen each other in a while. As we were walking, we were both reminiscing about our childhood memories, recalling silly things we used to do and all of our shared experiences. 

Out of nowhere, we both started cracking up at the same time for some unknown reason. We laughed and laughed, so hard that our stomachs hurt and tears were streaming down our faces. We staggered around and kept bumping into each other, while trying to catch our breath. 

We couldn't even remember why we were laughing, but it didn't matter. That moment made us feel so close to each other, as if no time had passed at all between us. Laughing together strengthened the connection between us, and every time we look back at that moment, we start to laugh all over again.
