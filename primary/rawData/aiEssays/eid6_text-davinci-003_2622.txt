The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City in 1931 posed a unique challenge: allowing dirigibles, or large airships, to dock at the structure. Despite the building’s monumental size and grandeur, there were a multitude of obstacles the builders faced in allowing these vessels to transport people and cargo to and from the top of one of the world’s tallest buildings. In her book The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted highlights the formidable obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order for airships to dock at the building’s mast.

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to face was the climate. New York City experiences very humid and volatile weather, making it nigh impossible for a large dirigible to land safely on top of a tall building. To counter this obstacle, the Empire State Incorporated hired engineers to design a precise mooring mast topped with a series of cables, anchors, and bolts. This mast would be strong enough to resist the gusts of winds, while still providing a soft place for the dirigible to land. In addition, atmospheric conditions were taken into account by installing dynamos and multiple electrical warning signs on the mast.

The second obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the mooring mast’s height. The mast had to stand a staggering 463 feet above the city. This meant that the engineers had to make sure that the mast’s cables and anchors could withstand the forces of gravitational pull when a dirigible tried to attach itself to the
