The Empire State Building, finished in 1931 and standing at the time as the tallest building in the world, was the first building to offer an area for commercial airships to dock at. The concept was a novel and exciting idea that quickly gained the attention of the public. Despite its potential, the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in integrating the dirigible docking area into their esteemed tower. 

The most immediate problem was the height of the building: the mooring mast, as it came to be known, had to reach a staggering 370 feet above the observation deck. In order to support the immense weight of the heavy airships, engineer Sanford E. Clark decided to construct the mast out of the same material the Empire State Building used – steel and iron. Unfortunately, due to the lofty heights, the usual methods of construction would be impossible – the workers themselves were effectively too scared to work off platforms that high above the ground. 

Instead, Clark decided to construct the mooring mast as his employer, John Jacob Raskob, had proposed: eight separate sections of steel and iron, each 16 feet in length, would be bolted together. Each section was small enough to be handled by the workers, who had to make sure each handled the bolts that attached the sections together to make the structure.

The detailed construction of the mooring mast was not the only obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to tackle. The airships themselves presented a variety of special considerations for the builders. The tall and bulky shape of the mooring mast was not only necessary to support an air
