I had been dating my husband for only three months when we decided to go out with a group of friends for a much-needed break. We were all exhausted from the long week and were ready to let loose and enjoy ourselves. 

After dinner, we decided to take a few drinks to an outdoor area near the restaurant, where we could all sit in the grass and enjoy each other's company. I was filled with excitement because I hadn't laughed this hard in a long time. We started playing a game called 'Name That Tune'. I'm terrible at remembering song lyrics so, of course, I was the losing team. My husband, on the other hand, was an absolute natural and was quickly getting us out of sticky situations. 

Each time he sang a line of the song, I would laugh uncontrollably. It was one of those moments when it felt like everything else just melted away and it was just the two of us, enjoying each other's company. The night turned into hours, and we weren't done until the sun came up. 

It was during that night that I realized how much I truly loved him and how much laughter meant to our relationship. It felt like magic! Together, we could laugh away our troubles and just be in the moment, which is how laughter has been an essential part of our relationship since then.
