The Empire State Building was a marvel of its time, not only for its grandiose architecture and design, but also for its innovative engineering feats. One of the most remarkable engineering feats related to the Empire State Building was the decision to allow dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the building’s 80th floor. Despite the logistical and safety concerns that this presented, builders developed the infrastructure necessary to successfully allow dirigibles to berth at the building.

The first obstacle presented to the builders of the Empire State Building was developing a feasible architecture and design to securely mount a mooring mast atop the building’s roof. Creating a sufficient structural framework required extensive calculations and posed a great challenge to the structural engineers involved. In addition, to accommodate the higher wind conditions at higher elevations, the mast had to be built with both longer and thicker components. In order to combat the rapid weather changes common in New York City, numerous design adaptations were made to increase the mooring mast’s overall strength and reliability.

Another obstacle builders of the Empire State Building faced when allowing dirigibles to dock was creating the necessary infrastructure to safely secure the airships. To ensure that the airships would not be affected by the wind, an intricate network of frames was built around the mast and the terminal building. These frames, called “girders”, were designed to be flexible, so that they would be able to absorb and buffer any wind shear. Furthermore, the girders were equipped with adjustable steel pulleys, which allowed the airships to have the necessary access
