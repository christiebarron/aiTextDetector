The sun was shining, but it was a crisp fall day. I was walking to class, my head buried in the book I was reading. Suddenly I stumbled on a crack in the sidewalk, knocking me to the ground. I was embarrassed and wanted to hide away, but instead I heard the most wonderful sound: laughter.

I looked up and saw a group of students watching me, laughing and clapping. It was all in good spirit, and despite my initial embarrassment, I couldn't help but start laughing too. I quickly got up, realizing that my own laughter had helped ease the tension. 

The awkwardness of my fall faded away as we all laughed together. The sound of those genuine, hearty laughs created an instant bond among the group and I felt welcomed and accepted in the university community. 

That one shared moment and our collective laughter were proof that there can indeed be a bond between strangers and that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
