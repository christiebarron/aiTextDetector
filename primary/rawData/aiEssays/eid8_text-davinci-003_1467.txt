I was visiting my grandmother at her nursing home. She was having a particularly challenging day and I was struggling to keep her spirits up. After trying a few different strategies, I decided to tell her a joke that I remembered from my childhood. We sat in her room and I told her the joke. We both started to laugh and for a few moments we forgot about the struggles of the day.

My grandmother grinned and said, "It's been so long since I've laughed like this!" We kept talking and I shared more jokes, some of which I could remember and some of which I made up on the spot. The laughter brought a new light to the room and I could see the worry melting away from my grandmother's face.

Laughter was the bridge that night that brought us closer together. It helped us to connect in a way that nothing else could and it created a fond memory that I carry with me to this day. We still laugh together and it's a reminder of the joy and bond that comes with it.
