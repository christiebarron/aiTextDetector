 

It was a typical summer morning and I had decided to take my dog for a long walk. As we passed a nearby park I couldn't help but notice a child sitting alone on a bench, intently reading a book. 

Curious, I struck up a conversation with him and found out he was 10-years-old and was reading a book about space. We talked about some of the planets he had read about and I was fascinated as he told me about the different features of each planet. 

As our conversation came to an end he asked me if I had any questions about space. I thought for a moment then asked him if there were any aliens living on the planets. He looked into the sky and said "No, that's impossible!".

We both burst out laughing at the ridiculous notion. He laughed so hard he was crying, and I couldn't help but join in. My dog barked in confusion and sat back down, his head cocked to one side with a look of amusement. 

In that moment, looking over at this boy, I felt a connection with him that could only be described as a shared moment of joyous laughter. 

It was in that moment that I realized how powerful a tool laughter can be: it had bridged the gap between two strangers and created a connection where none had been before.
