Dear Editor,  

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology advances and computers become ubiquitous, their effects on people need to be closely examined. My opinion is that computers have the potential to provide tremendous benefit to people if used in moderation, but excessive use of computers can lead to a variety of problems.

First of all, too much computer use can lead to runaway information overload. People become overwhelmed by a flood of emails, texts and social media messages, often leading to stress and further problems. Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to physical health problems like poor posture due to sitting for long periods of time, carpal tunnel syndrome and eye strain. 

On the other hand, computers offer tremendous benefits to people. Used properly, computers can help people stay better organized, find and access important information, communicate more effectively with colleagues and family members, save time by eliminating tedious tasks, and much more. 

The key is to find a balanceâ€”to use computers in ways that add value to your life and to your work, while also avoiding information overload, physical health problems and other potential problems. 

I hope that this letter encourages readers to think seriously about their computer use, and the potential benefits and risks associated with it. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
