As a child I was incredibly shy around people and had difficulty expressing my emotions. That all changed the day my best friend in school, Julie, and I were walking home together. I don't remember what we had been talking about, but as we rounded the corner near my house, I nervously said something that I instantly regretted. To this day I don't remember exactly what I said, but for some inexplicable reason it made us both burst out laughing.

That was the moment I discovered how laughter could bridge the gap between two people. It was the moment I learned that although it's not always easy to express my feelings, laughter can make everything easier. That day I gained the confidence to build meaningful relationships and find joy in life. 

I still laugh with Julie now and our bond remains stronger than ever. To this day, I believe laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
