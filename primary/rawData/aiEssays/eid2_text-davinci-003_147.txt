Dear Editor, 

As our world evolves so do our values and we must ask ourselves what is necessary to protect our youth? I believe that censorship in libraries must be considered. Libraries are essential resources for education and knowledge and the materials found within their walls should be reflective of our communities. It is of utmost importance to ensure that our libraries only contain material that is considered appropriate for all ages. 

It is my opinion that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from library shelves if they are deemed to be offensive. Libraries are for education and knowledge and materials that contain offensive language, explicit or inappropriate content, or otherwise derogatory themes may be seen as counterintuitive to this purpose. The presence of these materials can make the library a hostile environment and can influence impressionable individuals in the wrong direction. It is ultimately up to the community to decide what should and should not be available to view within its public libraries. 

The implementation of censorship in libraries is intended to create safe spaces of information exchange and must not be confused with acts of censorship that seek to suppress alternate opinions. Censoring materials in libraries is essential in order to protect the impressionable and the vulnerable and should be done so with the utmost caution. 

Being that libraries are owned by the public, I believe that the public should ultimately have the final say in what materials are available on its shelves. Censorship in libraries is necessary in order to protect our youth while also allowing them to explore the world of knowledge. 

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
