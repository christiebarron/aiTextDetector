I fondly remember the time my best friend and I laughed together for what felt like hours. We had decided to do a snow day– nothing but playing in the cold white powder all day.

The day started slow, but we quickly discovered that there was so much about the day that would make us laugh. We started with creating snowmen and quickly went down a slippery slope of silly snow games. She challenged me to a snowball fight and was both shocked and impressed when I won! We ran around in circles, with our faces and clothes covered in snow, laughing until our faces hurt.

The best moment of the day though? That was when I decided to lay down in the snow and make an angel. I spread my arms and legs out and laughed hysterically as I got snow all around my face. My friend ran up next to me and decided to lay down too… and soon we were both laughing noisily as our angel sculptures expanded and intertwined with one another. 

The best part is that years later, we still make each other chuckle when we think back to that moment. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and it never fails to bring us so much joy.
