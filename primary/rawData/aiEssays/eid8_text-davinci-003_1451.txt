I was out on a first date with a guy I had recently met. To be honest, I was feeling a bit nervous, as I usually get quite anxious in these kind of social situations. He seemed to be doing exactly the same, and the first few minutes were pretty awkward.

However, just as we were starting to run out of things to talk about, I made a joke about something. He then made a joke in response and we both erupted into laughter.

It felt like a huge wave of tension had been broken. We then started talking more comfortably. Although we didn't end up going out again, that first date was a great example of how powerful laughter can be in bringing two people together. It takes away any inhibitions or awkwardness that can be present in a new interaction, and helps promote an environment of mutual trust and friendship. That's why I always say, laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
