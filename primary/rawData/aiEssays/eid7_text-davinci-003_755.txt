I remember one time when I was a kid that I forgot to bring in an assignment that was due the next day. I was feeling pretty nervous and embarrassed, but my teacher was so understanding. She encouraged me to talk to her during lunch and assured me that it was no big deal. She patiently heard me out and then gave me the rest of the day to complete the assignment. Her patience meant a lot to me and made me feel comfortable coming to her with any speedbumps I had in the future.
