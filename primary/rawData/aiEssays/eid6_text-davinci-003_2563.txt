The building of the Empire State Building was a monumental endeavor, and the project had a unique bonus: the capability to dock dirigibles. The builders had a vision of airships delivering passengers right to their lobby, however, the reality of creating a space for airships to dock posed many difficulties.

One of the biggest challenges was engineering the building’s mooring mast. This required much engineering from architects and builders in order to ensure the stability and safety of ships when docked. The mooring mast and its stabilizer had to be designed in a way that allowed for efficient and safe docking. Addressing structural integrity issues, builders had to ensure the mast could easily withstand the pressure from the airships. To do this, the mooring mast was stand-alone, allowing the vertical mast to be well-braced and able to withstand torques from the spar.

On top of the physical engineering of the mooring mast, the builders also had to factor in light communication requirements. The New York Board of Light Commissioners provided the builders with specifications that would “ensure that there are no distracting lights emanating from the Empire State Building” when dirigibles were approached. To meet these requirements, builders added a bank of purple and green flashing navigation lights around the mooring mast to keep the skies unobstructed.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced considerable obstacles while allowing dirigibles to dock. Engineer and architects provided intricate plans to design the mooring mast and stabilize the structure, and further protocols from the New York Board of Light Commissioners had to be met
