To the Editor:

As the proliferation of computers continues in our daily lives, it’s important to consider their impact on people. It cannot be denied that computers have revolutionized our lives and have significant benefits—allowing us to complete tasks more efficiently, connect with each other around the world, and make complex calculations.

However, it’s just as important to consider the potential risks and challenges posed by computers. While computers can provide access to information, they can also lead to a lack of engagement with the real world. We can become so caught up in our computers, that we forget the beauty of physical relationships. It is also clear that, with the prevalence of digital sources of entertainment, including video games and social media, our attention is increasingly focused on digital activities, and not enough on basic mental stimulation and physical activity. 

In conclusion, we must be mindful of the effects of computers on our lives and ensure that the tangible world does not supplant our connections with the real one. Let us embrace the convenience that computers offer, but also be aware of the human consequences.

Thank you for your consideration,
