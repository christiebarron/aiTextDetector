The other day I was walking through the park when I saw someone I knew from high school. As I approached them, I noticed they were wearing a silly wig and had a joke book in their hands. I couldn't help but crack a big smile and call out, "Hey, what are you up to?"

The person smiled back and then proceeded to read me some of the funniest jokes I had ever heard. We laughed, and laughed, and laughed until we had tears in our eyes. Walking away from them, I felt like I had been wrapped up in a big, warm hug as the laughter connected us, allowing us both to feel seen, supported, and appreciated. In that moment, I realised that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
