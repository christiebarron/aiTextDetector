I remember one time a few years ago when I went on a car road trip with my family. We had to drive hours until we reached our destination. My siblings, my parents, and I decided to play some games in the backseat to make the ride more enjoyable. But I had to be the referee and it wasn't always easy. One of my siblings was constantly trying to cheat and change the rules. Sometimes I would get so frustrated with them that I wanted to yell. But I knew that was not the right thing to do.

So I took a deep breath and remained patient. I reminded myself that it was just a game meant to bring us together. I remained composed and tried to think of fun ways to settle arguments. I was firm when needed but also took into consideration their feelings about the game. 

By the end of the car ride, I was glad I remained patient. Instead of getting into a fight with my sibling the whole ride, we were laughing and joking. I learned a valuable lesson that day: that patience is the key to resolving conflicts without getting angry.
