Growing up with an older brother and a younger sister often led to a lot of laughter in our house. As the middle child I was always motivated to make my siblings laugh, whether it was telling a silly joke or playing a game. One of our favorite activities to do together was acting out family stories in the living room.

My brother and sister had a great time taking turns being creative with the characters and story arcs. My brother was an especially good actor, and even got my parents to join in on the comedy. It was my job to be the director and chief cheerleader. I managed to infuse each scene with precious family jokes, giving every act a unique edge.

I remember one time in particular when one of the characters, a grandparent, had forgotten something at home. I couldn't help but quip "Oh, you mean the woman who left her common sense at the door!" Everyone instantly cracked up. The laughter was so loud that the whole room felt alive with joy. 

It is moments like those that serve as a reminder of how powerful laughter can be. Not only does it bring us closer together, but it always creates lasting memories.
