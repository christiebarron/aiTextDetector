I remember it like it was yesterday. It was the first time I'd ever seen her. She had this contagious laugh—the kind that could make anyone laugh too, even if they just heard it in passing.

I was at a party that I didn't want to be at. I spent most of the night sitting in a corner, trying to disappear. I wasn't ready to meet new people and I didn't want to make a fool of myself.

But then I heard her laugh. I had no choice but to turn my head and look at her. She was standing across the room, talking to her friends and laughing loudly. It was the most beautiful sound I had ever heard. 

And then, suddenly, she caught my eye. I blushed and looked away, embarrassed. But then, a split second later, I found myself laughing too. I couldn't help it. It was like a virus; her laughter was so infectious that I started laughing along with her.

We continued to laugh together until eventually the moment faded away. But I'll never forget that moment. Her laugh was like medicine for my soul. I know now that it was our laughter— hers and mine—that brought us together and connected us in that moment. That's the power of laughter.
