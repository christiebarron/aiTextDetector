Public libraries throughout the nation serve millions of readers each year. These libraries opened for the express purpose of giving everyone access to a wealth of knowledge and free information. Unfortunately, some readers use libraries as an opportunity to acquire materials which may be deemed to be offensive by some. This has prompted some libraries to consider censoring the material on their shelves. 

Many voices have argued that censoring library materials is beneficial for public safety. Restricting access to certain materials would help protect vulnerable children from physical, emotional, and psychological harm. They suggest that libraries should be strictly regulated, like schools and other public institutions. 

However, allowing libraries to censor certain materials is a form of censorship as well. Censoring or removing books, magazines, and music has a long history of being used as a means of control. With library materials, this type of control can largely affect what the public has access to and what they are allowed to know. This could potentially lead to an atmosphere of fear and the suppression of dissenting viewpoints. 

Rather than instituting formal censorship policies, libraries should focus their efforts on educating their visitors and providing proper guidance. Libraries should introduce families to the idea of talking openly about each family’s beliefs and values regarding ideas and information in library materials. They should also provide age-appropriate materials that teach children and teens about what is appropriate for their age group. This type of targeted education is invaluable for preserving a library’s credibility and integrity. 

We should not remove or censor materials from our public libraries. This type of censorship erodes our collective freedom to use the library in
