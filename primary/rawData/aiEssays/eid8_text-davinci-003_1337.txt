I met my best friend in sophomore year of high school. We got stuck in the same AP English class together and, at first, we didn't think we'd have anything in common. We had completely different interests, backgrounds, and even music tastes. 

But it was the moment my friend and I shared our first laugh that our friendship was sealed. It wasn't over anything particularly funny and I'm not sure why it struck a chord, but suddenly we both burst out laughing. We instantly found common ground and could barely contain our laughter as we exchanged stories and observations. 

Our friendship is built on laughter. We share inside jokes, funny memories, and quirky stories. We've both been through difficult and stressful times, but when we're together, nothing can keep us from laughing. It's our bond and an important part of our relationship. 

No matter what we're going through or how much time has passed since we last saw each other, laughter is the connection that brings us back together.
