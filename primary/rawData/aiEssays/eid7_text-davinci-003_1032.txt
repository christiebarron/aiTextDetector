I was running late for work and knew I was in for some trouble once I got there. I started rushing out of the house and realized I had left my phone behind. After a few deep breaths, I calmly went back inside and retrieved it. 

I was already running late, but I never panicked. I took a few extra minutes to ensure I wouldn't forget anything else. As I drove to work, I reminded myself that getting myself worked up wouldn't solve anything. 

I finally made it to work a good 15 minutes late. To my surprise, my boss accepted my excuse without judgement. I was relieved, but more so, I was very impressed with how patient and understanding he was. I was grateful for how he handled this situation and it reminded me that it always pays to stay patient and composed.
