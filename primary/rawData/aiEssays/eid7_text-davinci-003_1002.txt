I recently encountered a situation where I had to practice being patient. After a long day at work, I headed over to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner. I planned to be in and out quickly and was in a bit of a rush. As I was standing in line, an elderly woman in front of me had a question for the cashier and she was having difficulty understanding the answer. As I waited, I could feel myself becoming increasingly impatient, but I forced myself to stay put and be understanding.

After what felt like an eternity, the woman eventually finished her transaction and it was my turn. Surprisingly, the cashier was incredibly kind and patient with the woman, despite her struggle to understand and all of the questions she had. I admired the cashier's attitude and I thought to myself that I could learn something, too. 

I was able to control my frustrations, and despite the fact that I was running late, I thanked the cashier for being so patient with the woman before me. The cashier smiled and said that it was no problem - that's what they're here for. His attitude was truly inspiring and it reminded me to be more patient in any situation where I may feel frustrated.
