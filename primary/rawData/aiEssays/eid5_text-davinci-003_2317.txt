Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a mood of nostalgia and reflection. Through the reflective act of looking back, Rodriguez recounts his family's journey from their homeland of Cuba to the United States after the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s. Rodriguez captures a sense of longing as he reveals personal family stories and experiences of emigration. He poignantly captures the sadness of leaving one's home, while also conveying a sense of hope and promise associated with the concept of finding a new home in the United States. 

Built into his narrative, Rodriguez creates a tension between reminiscence and searching for a sense of self. He openly reflects on his childhood and the emotions he was going through at the same time. In some ways, his memoir is an attempt to come to terms with his identity and circumstances as an immigrant in a new country environment. It is a journey full of sorrow and joy, fear and courage, and uncertainty and hope. He paints an intimate portrait of his family and the mix of sentiments they feel during this challenging journey. 

By evoking the image of his home country and the traditions his family had to leave behind, Rodriguez pulls the reader into the story. This can cause a range of emotions as the reader may also be reminded of their own experience as an immigrant or someone displaced by conflict. The mood of Rodriguez's memoir is often nostalgic and full of memories, but there is also an underlying feeling of strength and resolve that conveys the bravery of so many immigrants who risked the unknown. This underlying emotion adds to the richness of Rodriguez's memoir
