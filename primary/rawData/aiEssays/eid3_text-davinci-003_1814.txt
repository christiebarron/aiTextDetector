In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is faced with a dangerous, challenging course that had a direct effect on his performance. The setting and features of the course demanded a level of skill and training that the cyclist was not quite prepared for.

The cyclist must traverse a steep, winding road with twists and turns, offering few flat stretches to rest. The incline of the road was especially treacherous and required strength and stamina to traverse safely. The road was also riddled with potholes, broken pavement, and other obstacles to the cyclist's progress. All of these features of the setting demand a particular set of riding skills, forcing the cyclist to adapt to the conditions of the ride in order to make progress.

The bicyclist encounters other cyclists along the path that are able to handle the terrain with ease and confidence, requiring a similar level of performance from the cyclist-in-story.
