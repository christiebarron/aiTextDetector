The construction of the Empire State Building was an ambitious architectural undertaking that pushed the boundaries of building technology. Known as the premier example of Art Deco architecture, the Empire State Building presented unique challenges for the builders, one of which was the inclusion of a mooring mast – or docking tower – to allow dirigibles to land on the roof.  This posed serious structural and practical challenges that the builders had to overcome.

The most serious obstacle for the inclusion of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was structural. The mast had to be positioned as close to the building’s top as possible, making it significantly more difficult to construct. The mast would also increase wind resistance, a concern that the builders had to account for in the building’s construction. Furthermore, the mast had to be strong enough to withstand the forced exerted on it by the docking dirigible.

Another obstacle was the practical considerations of including a mooring mast. Because airships of the time used hydrogen to stay airborne, the designers had to figure out a way to account for possible fueling needs for the zeppelin. Additionally, the mooring mast required a dedicated pathway to run along the building, connecting the rooftop to the offices below. This presented a complicated engineering challenge that had to be met in order to allow passengers and cargo to transfer in safety.

The builders of the Empire State Building were well aware of the obstacles they faced when they attempted to install a mooring mast. But by putting forth admirable resolve and technical ability, they managed to overcome the structural, practical and engineering hurdles and successfully install
