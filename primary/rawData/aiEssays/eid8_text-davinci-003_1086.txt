I was out with my best friend, Charlotte, for her 21st birthday. We had been planning this outing for weeks and were so excited for the night ahead.

As we were walking to the restaurant, I made a joke about the street we were on and we both burst into uncontrollable laughter. Other people walking past us were laughing along with us and you could tell they thought we were having a great time.

That moment was so refreshing. Strolling down the street arm in arm, laughing together was a reminder that no matter what happened that night, we would be okay.

We kept up the conversation over dinner, always finding something to chuckle about. Even when I wasnâ€™t in the middle of a joke, I could still feel the warmth of laughter radiating through me and between us.

At the end of the night, as we made our way back home, we were still giddy with laughter. It was like the entire night I was surrounded by this beautiful bubble of laughter that just made the evening so incredible. 

It was in that moment that I realised how powerful and special laughter can be. That night was a reminder that no matter how tough life can get, as long as we have laughter, we will always be okay.
