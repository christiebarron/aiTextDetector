I remember one time when I was in a long line at the grocery store waiting to check out. The wait seemed endless, and people were getting frustrated. I knew I had to get home, but I decided to remain patient. I reminded myself that everyone was in the same position and stressing over the same thing.

So I remained in the line, checking out the items of the people ahead of me to pass the time. I kept my cool, even when I heard people getting angry and impatient with each other as well as with the cashier.

Finally, it was my turn and before I knew it, I was on my way out. I felt proud of myself for staying composed and showing patience, even when it felt like I was never going to get to the front of the line.
