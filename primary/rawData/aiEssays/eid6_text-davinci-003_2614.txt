The Empire State Building, upon its completion in 1931, was hailed as a groundbreaking architectural marvel, standing an astonishing 1,250 feet tall. Part of the design of the building provided for the use of dirigible airships (known as zeppelins) to dock at the Empire State Building, an ambitious project that carries with it a unique set of challenges. In her article, “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lüsted provides an in-depth look into the many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing zeppelins to dock. 

Perhaps the most daunting challenge was constructing the mooring mast to accommodate the ship. The mooring mast was required to extend 200 feet above the building, as the grandiose size of the dirigibles would necessitate extra room for descent and landing. In addition, because of the complexity and fragility of the airship, the mast needed to be designed to specifically support the weight and shape of the ship, while also providing a way to cushion the sudden force of impact upon arrival. 

The engineers also had to come up with a way to moor the zeppelin to the mast after it had landed. To accomplish this, steel cables were attached to the top of the mast, and lead weights tethered to the ship would be dropped into a cast iron container at the bottom of the mast. The idea was that as the ship descended, the weights would become more and more tense, basically providing a magnetic hold without the need of a crane to manually anchor the ship. Although the concept worked in theory
