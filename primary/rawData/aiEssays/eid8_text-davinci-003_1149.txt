The other day I was in a really bad mood after a long day at work. I had been rushing around all day and just felt exhausted. On my way home, I decided to stop by the store to pick up some groceries. As I was walking around the store, I noticed that an older couple in the next aisle was having the most jovial conversation. They were laughing heartily and exchanging the most amusing stories.

I couldn't help but stop and soak in the light of their laughter, and before long I found myself smiling too. Before long, I had even started to giggle. The couple eventually noticed me, and I sheepishly apologized for eavesdropping. Far to my surprise, the man threw his head back and let out a deep belly laugh. He grabbed his wife's arm and said, "Now here's a woman who knows how to appreciate a good laugh!" 

His wife nodded her head with a knowing smile and they both invited me to join them in their conversation. As the evening went on, we all had a wonderful time, sharing stories and laughing together. By the end of the night, my exhaustion had completely vanished, and I felt completely buoyed by the power of laughter. That night was a real reminder of the power of laughter to bring people together.
