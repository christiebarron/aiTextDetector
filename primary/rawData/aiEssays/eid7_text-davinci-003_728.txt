I was in line at the grocery store and the line was really long. I was getting frustrated because I had a lot of errands to run that day so I was starting to worry that I wouldn't get done with them all in time. However, I stayed patient and instead of getting frustrated or aggravated, I just reminded myself that everyone is out running their errands just like me and that it is all apart of life. I ended up being in line for a good 30-45 minutes but I didn't mind because I was able to stay calm and collected.
