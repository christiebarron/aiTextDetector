Dear Editor,

I write to bring attention to the effects computers have had on the people around us. As a society, we have become very dependent on the technology available to us and in some ways, this can be viewed as a detriment. 

As people’s reliance on computers have increased, they have become less social and forget how to interact with people face-to-face. It is so easy to stay home and have conversations only through screens, leaving little opportunity for social interaction. This can lead to further isolation and even impair one’s communication skills, making it more difficult to interact in person. 

Furthermore, computers can be related to physical and mental health issues. Sitting for long periods of time can cause physical ailments like back and neck pain, and staring at a screen for hours can even affect one’s eyesight. Additionally, mental health problems can arise from obsession with the digital world. This can lead to an unhealthy relationship with the device which can result in an unhealthy lifestyle. 

It is important for people to realize the effects computers have had on us and use technology in a responsible way. We should take breaks from staring at screens and make sure to be active and stay connected with people in person. It is by doing this that we can truly enjoy the benefits that computers have to offer. 

Thank you for your time,
