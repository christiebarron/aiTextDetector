Dear Editor,

As technology advances, more and more of us are using computers in our everyday lives. It’s no surprise that computers have a huge effect on our lives. From purchasing necessities to connecting with family and friends, computers have changed our lives in many ways. But have you ever stopped to think about the effects of computers on our lives?

Research has demonstrated that computers have the potential to both improve our lives and cause harm. On the positive side, computers have allowed us to become more efficient and organized. We can access information, complete projects at an increasingly fast pace and even shop without ever leaving our homes. Computers also provide countless entertainment options and allow us to stay connected with loved ones, no matter where in the world they are.

Unfortunately, computers also present some drawbacks. Spending too much time on computers can lead to problems like neck pain, eye strain and even depression. People can also get too caught up in the digital world and neglect their real life relationships. Computers can also create dangerous distractions that can lead to other serious problems. 

On balance, I believe the positive benefits of computers far outweigh the negative. Computers can make our lives easier, more efficient and open up opportunities for creativity. However, it’s important to remember to find balance and stay aware of the potential risks of computers. 

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
