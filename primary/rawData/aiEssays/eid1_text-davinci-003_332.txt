Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. While computers have undoubtedly been a boon in many areas of human life, there is cause for concern regarding the personal and social implications of their usage.

Computers are considered a major time-saver, but they actually consume much of our time. People spend hours using computers for work, school, and leisure activities. As a result, people spend less time engaging in meaningful personal interactions, leading to a decrease in social connection. This lack of connection has been linked to increased feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.

Moreover, the hours people spend behind computers have led to physical health issues, such as poor posture, eye strain, and carpal tunnel syndrome. These physical ailments can cause long-term medical problems.

However, there are also positive effects of computers. For instance, computers allow us to quickly access vast amounts of information, communicate with people all over the world, and conduct business with ease.

Thus, it is important to be aware of the potential dangers of computers, as well as their beneficial aspects. We need to find a balance between the two so that we can both enjoy the advantages of computers, while not sacrificing our health or our relationships.

I hope that I have persuaded you to recognize the potential risks of computers and to take measures to reduce their negative effects. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
