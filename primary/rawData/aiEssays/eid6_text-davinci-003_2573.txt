The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic skyscrapers in the world. Built in 1931, what many people might not realize, however, is that the designers of the building took into account the possibility of allowing dirigibles, or large airships, to dock at the top of the building. Constructing a building that could accommodate a large airship was a daunting prospect, and the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.
 
To start, the Empire State Building was already in the midst of construction when the idea of incorporating a docking area for dirigibles was proposed. This meant that the architects of the building had to go back and re-engineer parts of the building and design it from the ground up specifically for this purpose. Any changes would not only be costly, but could also delay the completion of the entire project and cost more for the buildingâ€™s developers.
 
Aside from the challenges of having to go back and re-engineer a large portion of the building for the dirigibles to dock, the builders also ran into challenges in making sure the docking area was structurally sound. This was a major concern since the weight of the dirigibles themselves would have to be supported, as well as the weight of the docking mooring mast or other equipment required for the dirigibles. 
 
Designing and engineering a docking facility for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building also presented challenges in terms of the weather. Wind and temperature fluctuations at the higher altitudes the dirigibles had to contend with before they could dock could
