Dear Editor:

The advent of computers has revolutionized how we live, work, and interact in the world around us. As technology continues to evolve and advances, it is important to consider the effects computers have on people.

While computers are ubiquitous these days and can increase efficiency and productivity, there are both benefits and drawbacks to our reliance on them. On the positive side, computers can serve as a great source of entertainment and interpersonal connection. For example, the internet provides access to a virtually limitless library of information and social media helps us stay connected with friends and family. 

There are, however, downsides to the increasingly digitized world we live in. Spending too much time in front of a computer screen has been linked to stress, insomnia, obesity, and even depression. As more of our lives are lived face-to-face on screens, many people find they have less time to interact in meaningful ways with the people in their lives, leading to feelings of isolation. 

Thus, it is important to strike a balance between the advantages and disadvantages to computers and technology. We should use it as a tool to enhance our lives, but remember that spending time outdoors, exercising, and connecting with others in person are just as important for a balanced and healthy life.

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
