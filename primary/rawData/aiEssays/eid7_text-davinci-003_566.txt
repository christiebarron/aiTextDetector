 

As a manager of a team, patience is essential. I remember a time when one of my team members was struggling with a project. I wanted to make sure that they felt supported during this process, and so I didn't pressure them to finish the project right away. Instead, I offered guidance and suggestions to help them work through the project at their own pace.

I was constantly checking in with them, to ensure they felt supported and able to take their time. I kept the rest of the team engaged by working on other tasks, so they could give this team member the space they needed.

Finally, after multiple weeks of careful guidance and support, we completed the project. Seeing that moment of pride in the team member's face made it all worth it. Although it was a difficult process, patient and caring support from me enabled them to work through the difficulties and put their best foot forward.
