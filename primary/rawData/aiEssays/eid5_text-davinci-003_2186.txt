The memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez provides a vivid depiction of his life growing up in New Jersey, from his unique early childhood to the beginning of his successful career in the fashion industry. Throughout the memoir, the mood is one of perceived innocence with a desperate desire for escape.

In the beginning, the tone is hopeful with a sense of optimism and possibilities. Rodriguezâ€™s early life is depicted as something that is, in a way, filled with promise, despite the familial and cultural limitations his family faces. The young child is eager to explore and make something of himself. Moreover, Rodriguez often paints a picture of his family life as happy and optimistic moments in his life. 

This tone quickly begins to give way to one of confusion and desperation as circumstances beyond his control begin to limit his choices and prevent him from achieving his potential. For example, financial struggles begin to force Rodriguez to make difficult decisions regarding how to manage his career in the early stages, while cultural norms begin to impede some of Rodriguez's academic and personal growth. 

As the memoir progresses, the mood shifts to one of regret, mixed with nostalgia, as Rodriguez reflects on his life and acknowledges some missed opportunities. Despite his success, he expresses sorrow over not being able to pursue certain passions and interests, such as music and painting, due to external pressures. Nevertheless, Rodriguez does not dwell in regret for too long and the mood quickly shifts into one of gratitude, as he reflects on all of the great life experiences and successes that have allowed him to be where he is today.
