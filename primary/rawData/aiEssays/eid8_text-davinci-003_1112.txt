My best friend and I had been planning a trip to the beach for months and the day finally came. We took the long drive, stopping for snacks and conversation along the way. When we arrived, the sun was shining and we both felt excited about the days to come. 

On the way to unpack our things, we noticed a man walking along the beach in the distance and we started laughing in unison. He was wearing a bright Hawaiian shirt and an oversized straw hat, and his tummy was protruding in front of him like a basketball. 

The more we laughed, the stronger the sound of his laughter seemed to become. When he noticed us looking his way, he started laughing too. We now know that he was laughing at the same thing we were, a humorous sight that only we seemed to notice. 

As he got closer, our laughter turned into a conversation and we soon learnt that his name was Paul and he was from England. We exchanged stories of our travels, laughed at his jokes and found out that we had some common interests. Before we knew it, we were friends.

Through laughter, we found a connection that had the power to transcend time and space. Even now, when we are apart, we smile to ourselves as we remember the moment that brought us together.
