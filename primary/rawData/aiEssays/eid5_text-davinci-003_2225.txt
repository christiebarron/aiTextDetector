In From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a deeply moving mood that is reflective, introspective, and full of a deep longing for connection. Right from the start, there is a sense of loneliness that pervades the memoir as Rodriguez describes the isolated state of his pre-pandemic world. He tells of how he spent much of his time “in transit, going in and out of airports, different cities, different hotels” and felt a disconnect from having to be constantly in motion. 

This loneliness is shown in his description of spending time alone without family or friends: “rarely met anyone, not even time to cook a meal”. His words paint a picture of a rootless, fragmented existence and the consequences of being in both a physical and metaphorical exile.

The memoir then moves into a more reflective mood as Rodriguez examines his feelings about the connection he's been seeking both throughout his work life and his personal life. He writes with candor and insight about moments of belonging and companionship, conveying a clear sense of the value of finding meaningful relationships. It's clear that this is something he's deeply conscious of, as he speaks to the impact that these connections have had on his life and how they have motivated his actions.

By the end of the memoir, there is a feeling of connection and comfort. Rodriguez speaks of the feeling of comfort he now finds in his family, home, and work. He emphasizes the importance of solid connections and how they can bring us comfort and joy, even in the moments of dislocation or loneliness
