I recently volunteered for a shelter for homeless cats and kittens. Due to the sheer number of animals, someone had to do the not-so-fun task of cleaning out the litter boxes. Even though I was often overwhelmed by the smell and the mess, I managed to remain patient and keep going. I was able to carefully go from box to box, scooping out the litter and cleaning them out. Despite the challenging task ahead of me, I was determined to get it done, and I managed to stay calm and collected throughout the process. I was reminded of how important it was to show compassion and to not judge; these cats and kittens needed love, and I was happy that I could provide that in some way. In the end, my patience paid off and I finished the task successfully.
