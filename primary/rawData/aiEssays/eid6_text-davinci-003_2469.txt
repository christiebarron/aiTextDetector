The Empire State Building, completed in 1931, was a marvel of engineering for its time, standing for grandeur and progress. One of its most unique features was the mooring mast, which enabled the building to become the first in the world to accommodate the docking of dirigibles or airships. Despite the initial enthusiasm for the prospect, the endeavor posed a number of potential obstacles to the builders of the Empire State Building.

The first obstacle was the logistics of designing the mast itself. The mooring mast had to be designed so that it could accommodate the enormous size, weight, and shape of dirigibles, as well as be able to withstand powerful winds. Designers also had to take into account that the mooring mast had to be just tall enough to clear the height of the building yet low enough to accommodate a landing. With such a complex design, the process of engineering a mooring mast proved to be no easy feat. 

The next dilemma was the risk of airships crashing or puncturing into the building. Although the mooring mast greatly reduced the chances of such an event occurring, the idea was still an unsettling prospect. In order to address this issue, the builders had to install a pair of five-foot-high steel bars on either side of the mooring mast to prevent the dirigibles from touching the buildingâ€™s outer walls. 

Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building had to ensure that there were no strong winds or storms when airships attempted to dock. Although the heavy winds of summer storms rarely allowed for safe landing,
