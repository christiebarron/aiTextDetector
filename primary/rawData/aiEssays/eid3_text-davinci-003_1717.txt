In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist is dealing with the physical and mental challenges of racing through a rocky landscape. The setting of races like this, with unforeseen obstacles, plays a powerful role in the cyclist’s experience. 

The cyclist has to traverse a rough terrain that is constantly changing. Rocks, ruts and jumps make the roadway unpredictable and dangerous. This means the cyclist needs to be constantly alert, prepared for sudden shifts in the road’s condition. Without full awareness and quick reactions, the ride will be filled with spills and bruises. 

The mountainous landscape also adds an extra element of difficulty. The cyclist is forced to climb and descend slopes that present their own unique set of hazards. These hills require full concentration and here too the cyclist must be ready for unexpected changes in the terrain.

Finally, Kurmaski’s use of lighting creates a sense of bleakness and vulnerability. The cyclist is riding in the dark, with only headlights providing a limited gaze. In this eerie landscape, tension builds with every bet, every dip and every jump. 

The features of the setting are essential to conveying the unique challenges
