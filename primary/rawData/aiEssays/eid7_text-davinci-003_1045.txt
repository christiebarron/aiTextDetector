I was in high school when I learned the true meaning of patience. On the first day of class, the teacher handed out a large book and told the class it was required reading. Everyone groaned collectively, as it was a thick hardcover with no pictures. We grumbled and complained, but I was determined to make it through the reading without giving up. 

I set a reasonable goal of two chapters a week, and worked diligently each day to stick to that goal. The reading was challenging, and I often found myself feeling discouraged. Yet, instead of quitting, I kept reminding myself that completing the book would bring me closer to my goal. 

As the weeks went by, my classmates began to give up on their assignments. I watched as they argued with the teacher about the pointlessness of the book and made excuses for why they hadn't completed their reading yet. 

That's when I realized that being patient was about more than simply not giving up. It was about maintaining a positive attitude and believing in the value of the assignment, even if it seemed difficult in the moment. 

By the end of the semester, I was incredibly proud of myself for having the patience to complete the book. It was a tough challenge and I'm glad I had the tenacity to see it through.
