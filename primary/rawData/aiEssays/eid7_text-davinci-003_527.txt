I was once walking with a friend down a busy street. We were running late for an important meeting, yet despite the situation my friend remained calm. As we hurriedly made our way through the people, my friend greeted everybody politely with a friendly smile. This made a lot of people pause to exchange greetings and ask questions. We were soon running so late that I began to worry and urge him to get moving. Instead of snapping at me, my friend remained patient and simply reminded me that a little bit of courtesy takes no time at all.

Eventually, we did eventually manage to make it to the meeting on time and my friend even received kind words from people along the way. His patience and understanding was what allowed us to not miss the meeting.
