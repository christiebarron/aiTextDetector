Minfong Ho’s poem ‘Winter Hibiscus’ tells the story of a person studying for a test, who is forced to take a break when the bitter winter sets in. The poem ends with the lines, ‘When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?’ This ending conveys a sense of hope and renewal that follows the harshness of winter. 

The narrator of the poem recognizes that nature will be reborn in the spring, and they are making a pledge to themselves that they’ll have renewed their hard work on the test when the snow melts. This is reminiscent of the cycle of life that humans experience throughout the year; the idea that death and destruction can bring with it growth and creation. In the same way that the snow melts and the birds return, the narrator of the poem is willing to take the test again in order to bring about a better ending for themselves. 

The hibiscus also acts as a symbol of this hope, having blossomed in the face of a cold winter. Despite the snow, the hibiscus manages to bloom and flourish, and it’s this that gives the narrator the determination and strength to take their test again in the spring. This is a powerful reminder that even in the middle of nature’s changing seasons – and our own struggles – the beauty of each season can hold the potential for growth and renewal.
