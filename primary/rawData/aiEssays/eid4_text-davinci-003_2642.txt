At the end of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the narrator reflects with hope to the future, specifically concerning their education. The repetition of when 'they come back in the spring' indicates that the narrator is looking beyond the present, even though they face apprehension and fear in their current circumstance of taking a test they feel ill-prepared for. Through the use of imagery including 'the snows melt and the geese return' the narrator is invoking a sense of renewal, demonstrating that spring is a time for growth and the narrator is looking forward to that time when the test has been taken.  

The narrator is not only looking for a positive outcome, but also for personal growth, for themselves and for those around them. This is demonstrated by the symbolism of the winter hibiscus found on the final page, as the narrator ponders 'if she did not bloom now, would she ever bloom?' The winter hibiscus has been referred to a number of times throughout the story, representing the courage and strength of the narrator and showing that a difficult situation can lead to eventual success. The narrator believes they must put in the hard work and take strides towards the future, regardless of the difficult circumstances they are facing right now. 

The representation of the winter hibiscus brings a renewed hope and demonstrates that with hard work and dedication, one can eventually overcome difficult times. The statement that 'when this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?' reflects the narrator's journey from feeling unprepared and scared, to understanding the importance of perseverance.
