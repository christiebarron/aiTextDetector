 

I was at the store when I noticed a sign that said there was a two hour wait for returns. It was a long wait, but I decided to be patient. I didn't make any negative remarks or complain, I just waited my turn. 

After a while I noticed the checkout lines were getting busy. I saw an older woman trying to find the right item in the store but she was having a hard time. I offered to help her and she seemed relieved. We spent over an hour together and I helped her find what she needed. 

At the end of the day, I finally made it to the return line. I was exhausted and frustrated, but I stayed patient and polite. The store worker thanked me for my patience and gave me a store credit. 

I learned a valuable lesson that day: patience is a virtue. Not only did I receive the store credit, but I was able to make a difference in someone else's day.
