The construction of the Empire State Building allowed for a new type of architecture, one that was compatible with the docking of dirigible vessels. This was an unprecedented engineering challenge and presented numerous obstacles to those tasked with building a facility capable of accommodating airships. In her essay, “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lüsted outlines some of the major hurdles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building while attempting to provide its unique capability. 

The most significant barrier was likely the incorporation of a mast system that layed atop the building's roof and extended to a height of 200 feet. This was necessary to suspend the helium-filled airships in order to keep them level and prevent them from crashing into the building. The mast had to be tall enough for the gibbous even the largest of dirigibles, but not so tall that its presence was noticeably intrusive. As such, the mast had to be strong enough to take the added strain from the airships, yet sufficiently lightweight that it wouldn’t increase the overall load of the building. 

The mast also needed to be designed to allow for the safe and easy docking of the ships. To accomplish this, workers were required to position a series of ropes and cables from the mast's top, down to its sides. This allowed the airships to be quickly secured in place while they were docked. Workers needed to be careful, however, to make sure the bindings were tight enough to handle the strain of the ship, yet loose enough to let the mast sway slightly in the wind.
