I recently offered a ride to a friend who had car troubles. While I was waiting for him to be ready, I could tell he was having a tough day. I wanted to be supportive and encouraging, so I tried to be patient. I asked how he was doing and he shrugged and said he was feeling frustrated. I offered a few words of encouragement and told him that everything would be okay. 

Finally, he was ready to go, but on our way home, the car began to act up. I had to pull over to the side of the road to take a look at what was going on. My friend was very worried, but I managed to stay calm and determined. After a few tries, I finally figured out what was wrong and was able to get the car running again.

Throughout this experience, I tried to stay calm and be patient with my friend. I spoke to him in a kind, non-judgmental way and did not allow my frustration to show. It was definitely a difficult time, but I managed to remain calm and supportive. In the end, my patience and understanding paid off and we were able to get home safe and sound.
