Censorship in libraries has been a long-debated topic, and one that continues to be hotly debated even today. Libraries should not be a forum for censoring material deemed offensive by some parties. Rather, libraries should provide an open platform for discussion and debate of materials that may be found offensive by some.

By allowing a wide variety of materials to remain in libraries, all members of the public — regardless of their beliefs, opinions and identities — can have equal access to books, movies, magazines and music. In this way, everyone can engage in meaningful dialogue about important issues, including potential controversial and offensive topics. By exposing people to a wide range of viewpoints, including those that may be considered offensive, members of the public can learn from one another and engage in meaningful discourse.

Furthermore, not all censorship is necessarily a good thing. If books, magazines, movies, or music are censored based on narrow, subjective criteria, it can lead to censorship of material that might be worthwhile and beneficial to those seeking knowledge or entertainment. By allowing access to a wide variety of materials, libraries will ensure that all viewpoints — no matter how uncomfortable they may be to some — can be heard, discussed and debated.

In conclusion, censorship in libraries undermines the freedom of expression, unduly restricts freedom of thought, and limits accessibility to potentially important materials. Libraries should be open, inviting places for all members of the public, regardless of their beliefs and opinions. Libraries should remain a forum for open dialogue and debate, not censorship.
