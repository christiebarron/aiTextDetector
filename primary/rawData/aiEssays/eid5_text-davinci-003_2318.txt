Narciso Rodriguez's memoir "From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" paints an evocative portrait of his upbringing and subsequent life of creative exploration. The memoirâ€™s most striking theme is nostalgia, conveyed through lyrical passages that invoke a mood of longing and remembrance. 

Through gentle, flowing prose, Rodriguez warmly remembers the influences of his early years. He paints vivid images of childhood scenes, like watching the evening stars while visiting family in Cuba and the action bursting with life in Newark's Central Ward. These experiences flavored his outlook on the world and the stories he heard embedded the power of home, family, and faith within his soul. Through the silver lining of nostalgia, the book reflects the gifts these icons of his life gave him no matter how elaborate or ordinary the circumstances.

Rodriguez writes about his late mother with reverence and love for the care she gave him as a child. He highlights her calming presence and the simplicity of her wisdom that guides his life even today. Memories of his father's meticulousness and devotion to his people speak deeply to the same ideals. 

The memoir is ultimately an intimate exploration of Rodriguez's experiences and how they are woven into what weaves together his world. The narration dances between vivid memories and reflective observations to offer a portrait of a life well lived and a person deeply connected to his home. The message of perseverance in the face of adversity is resonant, its tone hopeful, cautious, and compassionate. It examines the struggles he faced and the strength he found in his own courage and creativity. The mood is one of triumph, loaded with warmth
