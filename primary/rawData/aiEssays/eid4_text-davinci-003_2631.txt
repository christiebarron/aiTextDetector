The poem “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho is a reflection on struggles and resilience. It follows a student looking outside the window before their major test and seeing a hibiscus flower. Symbolically, the flower may be seen as a representation of the student’s own strength and ability to continue fighting even in the midst of difficult situations. 

The poem ends with an emphasis on renewal and hope: “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This language reflects the idea that even in dark times, there is always a chance for new life and new beginnings. The geese and snow represent a new start after a cold and challenging winter. Similarly, the student’s own “test” is something that can and should be faced again, a second chance to show resilience and strength.

This message of hope and renewal also resonates in hard times we may all face. Being faced with a challenging situation can be daunting, and can make us feel small and unprotected. But the poem is a reminder that no matter how dark things may seem, there is always hope for a new beginning and a way to create growth and change.
