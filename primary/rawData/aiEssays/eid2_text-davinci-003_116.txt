To the Editor: 

Censorship in libraries has long been a controversial subject. Does free speech mean unrestricted access to any and all books, music, movies, and magazines, or should certain materials be removed if they are deemed offensive? 

In my opinion, censorship in libraries should be allowed with certain boundaries and guidelines in place, to protect individuals and groups from material that is deemed as offensive. Libraries should have the right to remove inappropriate materials that are found to be offensive and contrary to normal community standards. This is especially important in a school library, where children are exposed to books and other media at a young age.

However, libraries should use discretion when censoring media. A rigid censor policy that removes anything deemed 'inappropriate' not only stifles creativity, but also inhibits an individual or group from expressing or sharing their own stories. Libraries should exercise caution when censoring, as to not remove a variety of religious, political, scientific, or artistic views. 

Furthermore, censorship should extend beyond just the physical shelves of the library. Library management should reach out to the public and inform patrons what materials are available to them at their local library. Libraries should remain open to questions and critique, and should be transparent with their procedures and policies when it comes to censorship. 

Overall, libraries should not be viewed as oppressive institutions that restrict the personal interpretation of books, music, movies, and magazines, but as places of refuge and learning. By allowing a certain level of censorship, libraries can protect their patron's from offensive material and still promote the positives of personal expression.
