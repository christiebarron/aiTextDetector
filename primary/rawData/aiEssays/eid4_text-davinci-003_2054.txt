In Minfong Ho's poem "Winter Hibiscus," the poet paints a vivid image of a hibiscus plant during winter in the cold snow. This plant is a symbol for the speaker and their experiences. When the poem concludes with the speaker determined to take the difficult test again when the snows melt, the geese return and the hibiscus begin to bud, it speaks to the speaker's commitment and hope for a successful future.

The speaker's attitude of resilience and optimism is demonstrated throughout the poem, particularly around the last line. In the midst of the cold and bleak winter, the speaker still believes that a better spring is ahead. This suggests that the speaker is undeterred in the face of difficulties, including the test that they apparently failed or were uncertain they could pass. They understand that with perseverance and determination, they can overcome this obstacle in the future.

The poem also implies a connection between the season and the situation that the speaker finds themselves in. The poem begins during the winter, when the landscape is at its darkest and snow is everywhere. This is a metaphorical representation of the difficulties that the speaker is facing and the lack of hope for a successful future. However, the speaker still finds the strength to try again in the future when their environment is more favorable. This emphasizes the importance of small victories and of looking to the future with hope and faith.

In conclusion, the poem "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho serves as a reminder that even during the bleakest of times, we must remain resilient until the warm and better spring arrives
