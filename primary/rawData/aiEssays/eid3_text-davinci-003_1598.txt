In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting of a steep mountain terrain has a direct impact on the cyclist—both physically and mentally. By creating a difficult physical challenge, the setting serves to push the cyclist to his limits and challenge his strength, skill, and determination. 

The rough and unpaved road of the mountain setting presents a unique challenge to the cyclist, requiring him to carefully navigate heaps of fallen rocks and maneuver his bike around sharp turns on hairpin bends. The hilly landscape makes it difficult to gain any momentum, as one wrong turn or misstep could force him to start all the way back up a nearly impossible incline. This creates a mental challenge as well, as the cyclist's determination and focus are constantly tested with the task at hand. 

Further building upon the physical difficulty of the setting, the presence of the wild vultures of the mountain structure add a sense of danger to the narrative. While the birds themselves may not be a direct physical threat, the presence of these predators serves to further heighten the cyclist's vulnerability and isolation, while also reinforcing his courage as he continues to take on the arduous task at hand.
