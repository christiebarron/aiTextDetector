In the book “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the memoir is largely one of reflection and appreciation. The author takes readers on a journey through his past, creating a reflective mood infused with nostalgia, joy, and sorrow. The memoir focuses primarily on Rodriguez’s childhood and his reunion with his absent father. Each story invites readers to ponder connections between home, family, culture, and identity.

Rodriguez's writing creates a melancholic yet mesmerizing atmosphere as his descriptions invoke vivid images of childhood homes, friends, family, and far away places. He writes with a realism that reveals his homesickness and complex relationship to his childhood memories. Throughout the memoir, there is a prevailing sense of longing to go back to the past, but also a realization that he can never go back and that life moves forward.

The memoir also conveys an atmosphere of peace. The sensation of comfort that Rodriguez feels as he reconnects with his father and re-explores his culture and heritage speaks to the importance of home and family. He does not shy away from difficult conversations or memories of hard times, but carefully considers their lasting impact. The memoir is less a kind of victory lap and more a reminder to take pleasure in the present. 

The tone of the memoir is ultimately one that celebrates the good and the bad of life, creating a mood of contentment and appreciation. Through this, Rodriguez makes the point that while life can be difficult, it is also our home and our unique blueprints.
