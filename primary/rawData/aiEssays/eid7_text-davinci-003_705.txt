Today was a long day at the office and I was feeling a little overwhelmed. I had so much to do, and I was struggling to stay on top of everything. As I was working, I realized that one of my co-workers was having a particularly difficult day. He was trying to do multiple tasks at once and was clearly feeling frustrated. 

I could sense the frustration in my colleague, and I wanted to help him, but I felt like I had too much of my own work to take care of. I decided to be patient and take my time with my own work while keeping an eye on him. After a while, I saw that he had calmed down a bit, so I took the time to sit down with him and talk over his situation. We discussed what tasks he was working on and worked out a plan of attack. 

By the end of the day, my colleague had managed to get all of his tasks done without feeling too overwhelmed. I was proud of him for pushing through and for my decision to be patient and take the time to listen to him. In the end, my patience and understanding had allowed us to get through the day without too much stress.
