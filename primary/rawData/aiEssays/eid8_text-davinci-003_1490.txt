I was fishing with my best friend for the first time and we weren't having much luck. After a few hours of no bites, she decided to try to catch some fish regardless. She didn't even have the right gear or bait, but she was determined to bring something in.

I watched her carefully while she fumbled around, trying to make some sort of makeshift waver out of a stick, twine and a hook. After a few minutes, I couldn't help but laugh at her awkward attempts and she looked up at me, laughing as well.

We both just sat there, doubled over and laughing, until finally she was able to get a bite and pull in a fish. We both cheered, and it was one of those moments that will always stay with me.

Laughter really is an important part of any relationship, but especially between best friends. In that moment, with that fish, it felt like we could conquer anything.
