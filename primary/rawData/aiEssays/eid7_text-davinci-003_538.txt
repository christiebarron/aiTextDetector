I recently had to wait in line at the store for what seemed like an eternity. Everyone was in a rush and kept trying to push ahead of me, despite the fact that we were all standing in the same place and that there was a clear line. 

At first, I was becoming frustrated and agitated, but then I remembered that being patient was the best way to handle these types of situations. I tried to take deep breaths and kept reminding myself that my time would come soon enough.

Eventually, the line began to move and I eventually got to the register. As I waited my turn, the cashier chatted with the person in front of me and started to slow down the process. But I held my ground and didn't give in to feeling angry or frustrated. 
I could see that the other customers were starting to get angry, but I tried to stay as calm and collected as possible.

Finally, my turn came and I was able to get out of the store. I was so proud of myself for not letting myself give in to my frustration. By being patient and calm, I was able to have a much better experience than I would have if I had given in to my emotions and let myself get angry.
