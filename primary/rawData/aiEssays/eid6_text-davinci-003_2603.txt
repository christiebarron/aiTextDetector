The Empire State Building became renowned as the first commercial building in the world equipped to dock dirigible airships. It is hard to believe that the engineers of this famous building ever managed to create a facility suitable for docking these unusual vessels. Despite their well-crafted plan, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first issue was the building’s sheer size and design. At 1,250 feet tall, the height of the Empire State Building is remarkable. The height of the building was intended to give it a distinctive skyline presence, but it posed a challenge for allowing dirigibles to dock. To properly moor the dirigibles, engineers realized that an elevated mooring mast would need to be added to the roof. This not only added significant time and resources to the project, but its sky-high height on the 102nd floor presented undue danger to construction workers.

Another obstacle was the soil conditions. Between 1932 and 1933 the building’s foundations were constructed in soil that was difficult to deepen, putting significant strain on the structure. To ensure the mooring mast had a sturdy base, engineers utilized a core caisson beneath the foundation. This solved the problem of an unstable foundation, but it posed a risk to the existing structure. The possibility of the caisson damaging the building in the process of being inserted added an extra layer of concern to the project. 

The weather posed the greatest challenge to the builders of the Empire State Building. High winds posed a particularly troublesome issue for the dirigibles, making it impossible for them
