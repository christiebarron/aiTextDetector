I remember it like it was yesterday. I had gone out to lunch with my friend. We had met in college and had grown to be close over the years.

We were chatting away about this and that and gossiping about our lives when we found ourselves in a fit of uncontrollable laughter. Everyone around us was befuddled by what had triggered it, and for the longest time, we could only laugh.

As the minutes passed, our laughter gradually began to subside and we started to figure out why this whole thing had even began. It turned out that my friend had mischievously sent me a rather inappropriate meme that I had taken in jest. The antic of it all and the sheer hilarity of the situation had caused the both of us to lose it.

Though we eventually managed to compose ourselves, the memory of that day still brings a smile to my face. It showed that despite our time apart, we still had the same undeniable bond and connection that brings a sense of comfort. Through the unbridled laughter, I was reminded that laughter indeed is the shortest distance between two people.
