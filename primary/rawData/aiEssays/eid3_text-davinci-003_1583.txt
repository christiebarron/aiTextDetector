In Joe Kurmaski’s "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist's path through a harsh winter landscape puts him in direct contact with the varied features of the setting. His journey takes him down a frozen road that is treacherously icy and has been further covered with thick layers of snow. There are few obstacles in sight, allowing the cyclist to pick up speed as he moves forward. However, his path also takes him past barren fields and winding rivers, which could be difficult to cross and require the cyclist to adjust his speed. The coldness of the winter environment is a prominent feature of the setting, and it affects the cyclist directly as he has to fight freezing temperatures and the windchill factor. Even the darkness of night sets the mood of the story, immersing the cyclist in a feeling of abandonment and grief. The winter conditions of the setting challenge the cyclist to persevere and stay strong—a challenge that ultimately makes him realize the importance of his journey. By pushing himself beyond his perceived limits, the cyclist is able to confront his struggles and move forward on his path. The setting of the story, thus, provides a platform for the protagonist to grow and reveal his personal strength.
