The cyclist in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski is greatly impacted by the features of the setting. By taking place on a difficult mountain pass, the story depicts the cyclist's difficult journey as they battle against the elements. The cyclist experiences treacherous hairpin corners as they navigate their way up the mountain. This is combined with steep grades that are littered with gravel, forcing the cyclist to fight to maintain control of their bike while trying to make it to the top. 

Additionally, the harsh features of the setting also cause emotional distress in the cyclist. The challenge of the climb is one of formidable strength, and the cyclist is constantly reminded of their mortality as they ascend the pass.

The emptiness of the wilderness takes away any sense of hope as the cyclist is seemingly travelling through an unconquerable terrain. 

The beauty of the mountain is also depicted by Kurmaski. The cyclist stops to admire the splendor of his surroundings. This provides the cyclist with a brief respite from the difficult conditions of the climb. Despite the difficulties of the terrain, the cyclist finds joy in the natural beauty of their surroundings
