I was at the park the other day with my children, when we noticed that there was a line for the swings. My children were a bit frustrated, as usually the lines for the park amenities would be minimal. Out of nowhere, an elderly lady approached us and offered to let us go ahead of her in line. She had been there for a while and kindly said it would be no problem for my family to go ahead. I was humbled and thankful for her act of kindness, and I thanked her profusely. She refused any praise, instead urging us to go ahead so she could watch my children on the swings. I was so impressed by her patience, generosity, and grace that I was brought to tears. She was definitely a special person and I will never forget the moment she so willingly stepped aside for us.
