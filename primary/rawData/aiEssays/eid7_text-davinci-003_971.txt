I was recently on a long-haul flight and the person sitting next to me was very impatient. He was looking out of the window and tapping his fingers on the arm rest. At one point, he even shouted at the flight attendant when she asked him to put his seat up. 

Meanwhile, I kept my patience, told him to relax and be mindful of the fact that we were on a crowded plane and could not get off whenever we wanted. I asked him to take out his headphones and watch a movie to become distracted from the length of the flight.

My patience worked and after sometime he calmed down and we started talking about our respective cities. By the end of the flight we had become good friends. Had I not been patient, I wouldn’t have been able to change his attitude and be a good impact on someone’s life.
