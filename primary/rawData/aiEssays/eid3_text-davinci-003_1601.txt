In Joe Kurmaski's story “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting and environment affects the cyclist's experience in a significant way. To begin, the environment is portrayed as a hot, rural, and desolate road. The cyclist is described as riding through a valley of “dusty dirt roads,” “blistering heat,” and “lonesome fields.” Paired with the fact that there are no other cyclists, cars, or help to be found, this creates a powerful sense of isolation. The cyclist is exposed and vulnerable to their environment. The heat, dust, and desolation of their surroundings leaves them feeling hopeless and desperate.

In addition, the landscape changes drastically over the progression of the story. At the beginning, the cyclist is riding through “Lonely, empty country roads,” but by the end, the cyclist is riding through “rugged, steep terrain,” which further adds to the sense of isolation. As the environment becomes more rugged, the cyclist is exhausted and unable to keep up with the difficult terrain. This leaves them feeling helpless and powerless against their environment, and the situation that they find themselves in.
