Dear Editor,

I am writing to you to express my opinion about the effect computers can have on people.

In today's modern world, computers are an integral part of our everyday lives. We use computers for communication, entertainment, shopping, and much more. With the incredible advancements in computer technology, it is no wonder that computers have become a normal part of our lives. 

However, many people have expressed concerns about the effects computers can have on people. They are concerned that people are spending too much time in front of the computer and becoming more disconnected from the real world and reality.

While I understand these concerns, I believe we must look at the positive effect computers can have on people. Computers can be a fantastic learning tool and help people to become more educated about the world around them. They help us stay connected with our friends, family, and others around the world in a way that was impossible before. They provide us with an easy way to research and access information that wasn't available before.

As with any technology, computers can be abused. However, we must remember to focus on the positive effects they have. Computers can help us stay connected to the world around us and help us to grow and expand our knowledge.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
