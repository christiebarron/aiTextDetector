In the short story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the stunning features of the setting immediately establish a sense of difficulty and challenge for the cyclist. 

The story opens with the narrator describing the "abrupt" cliffside turns, the sun that is "certainly of no help," and the terrain of mountainside roads that "unnervingly veer off in unpredictable directions." The narrator's attempt to make the journey on a wooden-wheeled bike is further highlighted by the inability to get over "any decent-sized rise" without a struggle. 

Such features of the setting naturally set the stage for the cyclist and immediately present a difficult challenge. The narrator is aware that the small wheels and the narrow handlebars are inadequate for the difficult journey, feeling that his arms are "paying the price." From the start, the terrain is working against the cyclist and he is left to overcome the elements purely through strength and determination. The narrator even goes further to reference how the "road probably could sense [his] determination." 

By setting such a demanding environment, the author is able to establish a greater story that focuses on the struggles of the athlete and the determination required to overcome.
