The Empire State Building presented a unique and daunting challenge to modern engineering when it was built in 1931, but the builders of the building were determined to take it one step further and accommodate dirigibles moored to the iconic New York skyscraper. The first major obstacle in achieving this ambition was the question of whether the Empire State Building could handle the additional weight of a dirigible, with its men and materials, securely moored to the top of building. Further concerns surrounded the construction of the mooring mast, which needed to be securely mounted on the roof of the building, and reinforced to withstand the immense strain of the moored dirigibleâ€™s weight and wind.

The mooring mast, designed by W. Starling, had to be constructed to withstand the weight of dirigibles with their loads of passengers, crew, and cargo, as well as the immense shifting of momentum experienced as the ship adjusts against the dock and the wind. The design called for a large metal trunk at the base of the mast, which was to be filled with concrete and bound together with metal in order to provide the necessary structural support. Additionally, the mast had to be affixed to the building high enough to maintain the clearance required for mooring. The engineers poured a special type of concrete into the trunk that had the unique property of hardening very quickly, allowing the mast to be built faster and with greater efficiency.

Another hurdle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the installation of signaling and communications equipment on the rooftop. The installation of this sophisticated apparatus was important to facilitate safe and
