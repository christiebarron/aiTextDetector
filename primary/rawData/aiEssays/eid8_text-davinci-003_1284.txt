It was our third date, and I remember it being the day I knew I found my person. We had gone out for a walk around the park and were sitting on a park bench, enjoying the warm summer breeze as we talked. We laughed about our day and shared funny stories, and then I started cracking jokes. They weren't the best jokes, but he was laughing really hard. After that I just couldn't stop. I would start out laughing and he would encourage the laughter by joining in, and soon enough we were both nearly rolling on the ground in tears, we were laughing so hard. It was so contagious that soon enough there were strangers around us laughing with us too!

Laughter is truly a beautiful thing, and that day I knew laughter would forever be a part of our relationship. We've been together for years now, and nothing compares to the joy laughter brings us. Whether its about silly little jokes or even the most mundane of topics, laughter keeps our relationship strong and our bond unbreakable.
