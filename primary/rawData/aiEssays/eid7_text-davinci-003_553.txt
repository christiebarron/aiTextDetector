I remember one time when I was patient. It was a few years ago when I was in school and had to work on a project with two other classmates. We were all assigned to put together a presentation on a famous artist and we only had a few weeks to put it all together.

At first, I was excited about the project. I was looking forward to learning about the artist and working with my peers. However, it didnâ€™t take long for the excitement to wear off. We all had different ideas about how the presentation should go and it soon turned into a heated disagreement. 

Rather than getting angry, I chose to be patient. I listened to my peers, asked questions, and tried to find a common ground. After a few hours of discussion, we managed to come to an agreement on how the presentation should look. 

In the end, thanks to my patience and understanding, we managed to put together an incredible presentation that got top marks. Looking back, I'm proud of how I handled the situation and of the work we were able to produce when we worked together.
