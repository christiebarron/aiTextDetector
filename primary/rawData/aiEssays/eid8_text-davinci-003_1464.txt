When I was a teenager, I had a very close friend that I had known since first grade. We were like soulmates and did everything together. One day, when some of our friends were over, we started taking turns telling jokes. We had some good belly laughs, but one of my friends took the joke too far and said something truly offensive. Everyone was completely silent, and I just stared at my friend for a few moments in disbelief.

But then, my long-time companion started to laugh. Not just a chuckle or a giggle, but a full-on belly laugh. Since she knew my friend well and had heard him say worse things in the heat of the moment, she knew he didn't actually mean it and found the humor in the situation.

Her laughter was so contagious that soon enough, we were all in tears from laughing so much. It really changed the atmosphere in the room, and the tension that had been building disappeared. After that, I remember always being so thankful for the understanding of my friend and the laughter that she provided. It was an invaluable experience I will never forget.
