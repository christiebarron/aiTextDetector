I was volunteering at a local soup kitchen one weekend when I encountered a man who was obviously having a difficult day. He was frustrated and angry as he tried to find a place to sit down and eat. He pushed past me but I stayed calm and asked if I could help him. He scowled and barked that he just wanted to sit somewhere. I calmly offered a chair at a table where he could have some peace -- and a plate of food.

He wobbled to the chair and sat, shaking his head. He muttered something about feeling invisible and that no one cared. I told him I cared and slowly he began to open up. He explained that he was in a really tough spot and had been feeling overwhelmed by life. He hadn’t asked for help because he felt embarrassed and ashamed.

I told him that he didn’t have to be embarrassed and that everyone has tough times. I patiently listened to his story and offered him what support I could. I assured him that with the proper resources he could begin to get back on track. He nodded, not quite believing me.

At the end of our conversation, he thanked me for being so patient and kind. Those few moments made me realize that patience can make all the difference -- for both of us.
