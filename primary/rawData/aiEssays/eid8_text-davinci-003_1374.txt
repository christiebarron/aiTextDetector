 

When I was little my Mom and I used to play silly games to make each other laugh. One game was pretending to be animals, where we would try to mimic different animals and match each other noise for noise. We'd start with a loud bark for a dog, and then an attempt at a cat's meow and so on and so forth. We'd always end up tangled up in a fit of laughter over our attempts. 

Growing up, it didn't matter how old I got, laughter was always a way Mom and I connected. Whether it was something funny she said or something funny I said, when laughter was shared between us, it was like a reminder that we were in this thing called life together. 

Laughter will always be a special part of our relationship because it lets us look at this wild and chaotic world with a sense of joy that can't be found anywhere else. There's no better feeling in the world than laughing with the person you love most.
