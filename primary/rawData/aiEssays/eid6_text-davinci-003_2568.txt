The Empire State Building was built to be the tallest and most iconic structure in the world. Its construction between 1929 and 1931 was a monumental feat, and its size made it an enticing target for dirigible airships. The builders, however, faced a number of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. This essay will describe the challenges presented by such an undertaking using information from "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted. 

One of the primary obstacles was the wind. According to "The Mooring Mast," "strong, consistent winds posed a challenge to commanders as they attempted to maneuver large, fast-moving, lightweight airships through the air." This created a situation where the airships had difficulty sitting in one spot, making them hard to dock with the building. Additionally, airships had a tendency to drift away from their intended mooring spots, complicating any potential docking attempts. Wind was just one of many weather factors that had to be accounted for, as the slightest gust would be enough to send an airship flying off course.

Another major issue was the relatively small size of the landing platform. "The Mooring Mast" notes that the platform was designed to accommodate only a third of the typical length of a dirigible, which reduced the stability of any docking attempts. Dirigibles were large, so they needed a sufficient amount of space to properly dock with the building. A lack of this would make it difficult to ensure the airships were secure while they were moored. Furthermore, dirigible engines tend to generate a considerable amount of noise
