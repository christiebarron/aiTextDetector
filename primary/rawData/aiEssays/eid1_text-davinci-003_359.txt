Dear Editor, 

In recent years, we as a society have become increasingly reliant on technology, particularly computers. While this shift is often seen as a necessary progression in technology, there can be detrimental effects to relying so heavily on computers.

Many people have expressed concerns that computers can create a lack of interpersonal communication and social isolation. Using computers can make it easier to stay in touch with people, but at the same time, it can keep us from finding real time activities and forming meaningful relationships in person. Additionally, computers can replace jobs, displacing people and leaving them with few options for work. This can cause a decrease in financial security and an increase in anxiety levels.

However, computers can also be quite beneficial. People looking to start their own business can use computers to stay organized and create a good impression, which may lead to opportunities for business growth and success. Additionally, computers can provide people with a vast amount of information, enabling them to make informed decisions. Moreover, the use of computer applications and websites make filing taxes, booking airline tickets, and research for school or work much easier.

Overall, computers can have both positive and negative consequences. It is important to remember that too much dependence on computers can be damaging and we must use them mindfully and with caution. I believe that instead of relying solely on computers for communication, people should be encouraged to invest in relationships, both online and offline.

Sincerely,
