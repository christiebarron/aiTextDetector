The building of the Empire State Building in the 1930s is a well known part of American history. Yet, while it is well known as an iconic skyscraper, what is lesser known is how the creators of the building made an effort to create a mooring mast so that dirigibles—large floating balloons filled with gas—could dock to the building. The builders faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, not the least of which was the daunting task of engineering a strong, reliable mooring mast.

The first major obstacle was constructing a mast capable of supporting the weight of a dirigible. According to The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the mast had to be designed to prevent sudden jerks and shakes when the wind changed, to ensure the safety of any people on board the dirigible docking at the time. Allowing a dirigible to dock safely required an engineering feat, as the mast had to efficiently hold a number of substantial weights securely. Using steel, it had to be strong enough to support up to 100,000 pounds and its size had to be tall and wide enough to accommodate a large air balloon. This was a daunting task, as any failure or miscalculation could prove costly.

A second obstacle was the high cost of the mooring mast, as the building costs already totalled a staggering $41 million. Adding the additional cost of engineering and constructing the mooring mast pushed the total even higher. The financial expense was further compounded by the various materials and engineering expertise needed to construct the mast. Extra labour
