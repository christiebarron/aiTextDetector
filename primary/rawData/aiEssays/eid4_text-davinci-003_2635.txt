The Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is a poignant coming-of-age story about a young girl, Nae, in rural Taiwan during the 1970s. In the winter before she takes a test that will determine her future, Nae and her family must hunker down in their tiny home and endure the extreme snow and cold. In the last stanza, Nae reflects on the struggles of the present, but also looks forward to the better days ahead—but only if she passes the exam. 

The poem’s ending speaks to the importance of education and the opportunities it promised to Nae and her family—opportunities not to be taken lightly. During Nae’s time, a pass would grant her access to higher education—and thus, potentially a better life than what she had known. The promise of success in the future, which is embodied by the hibiscus in her garden, reflects the political and social reality of the time. Nae’s goal is to use her education to escape economic hardship and the limitations of the rural lifestyle. 

The repetition of certain words, such as “snows,” “geese,”, and “budding,” indicate the seasonal cycles of nature, which metaphorically suggest the continuous cycle of life and the hope that comes with it. The poem’s conclusion also indicates a message of resilience and perseverance—qualities that are highly emblematic of Nae’s generation. Despite the challenging circumstances she and her family endured, Nae remains hopeful
