The engineers who were responsible for the conceiving, designing and building of the Empire State Building faced an ambitious task in allowing dirigibles to dock at its summit as part of the heavily annexed building's menu of options. Despite their best intentions, it was an endeavour that ultimately failed, due to a variety of obstacles that had to be faced. 

The most crucial challenge the engineers had to face was one of practical considerations. During the time when the plans were being drawn up and the building still being constructed, the cost of adding a feature such as allowing dirigibles to dock would have been a considerable one. One would have had to take into account the cost of installing the necessary cable system and extended mast (or “mooring mast”) to both the building itself and to the infrastructure of the city - no small task. Not only this, but due to the harsh weather conditions often experienced in the New York winter, a good deal of resources and expertise would have needed to go into ensuring that the mast and its mechanisms were resilient enough to withstand those conditions.

A related obstacle was present with finding the mooring mast itself. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains in her book 'The Mooring Mast’, dirigibles at the time were light and specified for certain steads; aircraft of that era were larger and heavier and so a mast of sufficient length with appropriate strength and security was apparently not readily available, and indeed undiscovered they made a complex issue even more complex.
