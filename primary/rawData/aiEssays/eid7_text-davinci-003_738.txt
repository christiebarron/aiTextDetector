I remember one time when I was younger, my younger sister had done something really wrong and was really upset about it. I saw her crying and knew I needed to be patient with her in order for her to feel comfortable talking to me about it. I sat with her and let her talk as much as she wanted. I tried my best to remain calm and provide sympathetic responses. Eventually, after much discussion, she felt comfortable enough to tell me what had happened and why she was so upset. We then worked together to come up with a plan on how to make things right. She appreciated my patience and understanding - it was a moment I will never forget.
