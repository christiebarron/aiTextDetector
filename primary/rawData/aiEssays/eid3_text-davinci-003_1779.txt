In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist faces a variety of obstacles related to the features of the setting. This setting is a “six-mile stretch of rock-strewn road” that is “tougher than rough.”

The harshness of the road has a great effect on the cyclist. It is extremely trying, causing physical pain and discomfort. The loose rocks moving around as the cyclist passes by make it difficult to keep an even balance and focus. The long stretch of the rocky road also adds to the mental challenge. The cyclist must must keep their energy up for the entire length of the road, without any breaks or pauses. They must remain motivated in the face of a daunting challenge. 

The bright sun is also a factor that the cyclist must face. It adds to the physical difficulty of the road, making it even harder to complete the journey. The sun reflects off the rocks and creates a constant glare that strains the cyclist’s eyes. It also adds to the mental difficulty of the journey, for the sun is blinding and oppressive. Combined with the physical pain it creates a powerful force that the cyclist must overcome.
