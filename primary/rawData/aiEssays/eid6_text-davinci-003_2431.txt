The process of allowing dirigibles, or large, lighter-than-air aircraft, to dock at the Empire State Building was a formidable task. Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s novel, The Mooring Mast, provides key insight into the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order to make dirigible docking possible.

The first obstacle the builders had to overcome was the sheer size of the Empire State Building. At its completion in 1931, the Empire State Building stood 102 stories and 1,250 feet tall. In order to provide for aircraft docking, the builders had to construct a mooring mast that towered above the building itself. This mast would have to be able to support the weight of a large dirigible as well as provide a secure anchoring point from which the dirigible could be moored while passengers were boarding and disembarking.

Additionally, the builders had to contend with the problem of the high winds at the top of the building. At such a high altitude, the wind can reach dangerous speeds capable of tearing a dirigible apart if it is not either securely anchored or properly fastened. To address this issue, the engineers created a system of winches and cables to secure the mooring mast and dirigibles in place instead of allowing them to drift freely while moored.

The builders of the Empire State Building also had to grapple with the fact that the mooring mast had to be easily accessible by both ground and air. To accommodate travelers on the ground, an elevator was installed in the center of the mast from which the passengers
