I remember a time when my brother was having a hard time understanding his math homework. He was getting frustrated and was ready to just throw in the towel and give up.

I could see his disappointment and frustration and knew that he was never going to learn anything by quitting. So, instead of getting angry at him or trying to rush him, I decided to be patient.

I explained each problem slowly and carefully, avoiding any sense of judgement or criticism. I knew that if he felt comfortable and unpressured, he was more likely to be able to understand and solve the problem.

After about an hour of asking questions and going over equations, my brother suddenly shook his head. He realized what he had been doing wrong throughout the whole assignment and was able to complete the rest of the problems on his own.

I felt proud of myself for being patient and taking the time to work through his problems with him. Seeing him finally get to that "a-ha" moment was incredibly satisfying, and it taught me how beneficial it can be to remain calm and have patience in any challenging situation.
