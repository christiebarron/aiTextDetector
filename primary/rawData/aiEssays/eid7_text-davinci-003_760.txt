I was walking around the supermarket, trying to get all of the ingredients I needed for a recipe. I got to the checkout and the person in front of me had a lot of items and was having some trouble. The cashier was being very slow in scanning the items which was causing the line to get longer, but I just waited patiently. 

A woman behind me in line was becoming increasingly frustrated, constantly shifting her feet and fidgeting. Eventually, she shouted, "This is taking way too long! Why can't these people learn how to work faster?" 

I felt embarrassed for everyone in line, so I decided to try to bring some peace back to the situation. I turned to the woman, caught her eye and smiled. I told her, "It's okay, these sorts of things happen. Let's have some patience." 

I could tell she was calmed by my words, and she thanked me and went back to patiently waiting. As I watched the poor cashier struggling to scan all the items in front of me, I felt relieved that I had been patient myself and had been able to provide some understanding to the situation.
