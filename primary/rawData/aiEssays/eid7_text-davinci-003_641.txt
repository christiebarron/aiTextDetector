When I was a kid, I remember being stuck in the house when it was raining outside. I was a very active child and I felt so cooped up that I became fussy and irritable. My parents, however, remained patient and understanding the whole time. They let me vent my frustrations and talked me through my emotions. They even found creative ways to pass the time by playing board games and cooking together. Even though the bad weather kept us inside, their patience and understanding made the day enjoyable instead of boring.
