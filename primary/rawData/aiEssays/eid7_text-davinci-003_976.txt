I was in line at the store recently, and I was feeling pretty grumpy. I had been standing in line forever and the person in front of me was taking their sweet time deciding what they wanted. After what felt like an eternity, they finally made their purchase and left, but then the cashier began to take an unusually long time to scan and bag the items. I was getting annoyed and ready to snap, but then I remembered my goal to try to cultivate patience.

So instead of getting angry I simply closed my eyes, began to take some deep breaths and calmly waited for the cashier to finish. Despite my annoyance and desire to disappear, I pushed through and kept my cool. After what seemed like forever, I finally reached the register and made my purchase.

Having patience was difficult but rewarding. I was able to navigate a stressful situation without letting my emotions take over, and that was a great feeling.
