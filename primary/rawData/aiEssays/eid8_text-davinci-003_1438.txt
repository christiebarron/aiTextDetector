I remember the day I met my best friend like it was yesterday. When we first met, I could feel a little tension in the air. We had both been through some tough times, and it seemed like neither of us wanted to open up.

That all changed when I made a silly joke about something. We both started laughing uncontrollably and I could feel the tension evaporate. We became fast friends from that moment.

Whenever we got together, whether in person or on the phone, we would always laugh and joke about anything and everything. We could talk about difficult subjects too, but when it got too heavy, we would lighten the mood with a joke or a funny story.

It's been years now since we first met, but we still laugh just as hard as that first day we met. We've been through so much together that laughter has become a staple of our friendship. It's easy to talk with my best friend, even when hard times come back. That shared laughter has made all the difference.
