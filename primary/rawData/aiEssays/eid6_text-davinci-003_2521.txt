The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic skyscrapers in the world, and its construction posed many unprecedented engineering and design challenges. One of these challenges was the incorporation of docking ports for dirigibles, an early type of airship. Building a docking port on top of the tallest building in the world was a daunting task, but it presented a unique opportunity to establish a new mode of air transportation. In The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted explores the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in making this dream come true.

First and foremost, the Empire State Building needed an effective way of mounting the dirigible, as the immense weight of an airship posed a serious threat to the integrity of the building’s structure. To address this issue, airship designers designed a system of steel masts and cables topped with a mooring mast. The mooring mast was attached to the Empire State Building at the 82nd floor, and could accommodate dirigibles weighing up to 150,000 pounds.

The final obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome was the location of the docking port. Since the building was located in Manhattan, where the landscapes are congested and buildings block the nearby skies, the designers needed to find a way to bring the dirigibles in over the surrounding buildings while avoiding any obstacles. The solution they came up with was to design a system of lights and markers to guide the airships in. Finally, engineers had to figure out how to protect the building from the high winds created by the passing airships. To remedy
