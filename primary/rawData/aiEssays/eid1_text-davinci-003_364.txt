 

Dear Editor,

The fast-paced advancement of computer technology has caused a paradigm shift in the way individuals communicate, work, and stay informed in our society. While these technology tools certainly offer vast conveniences to our lives, the impact of computers on people merits close examination. 

First and foremost, it is essential that individuals of all ages understand the importance of balance. Too much time spent before a computer monitor or within a virtual environment can impede physical and mental health, affecting life in tangible ways. As physicists, psychologists, and other professionals stress, we need to remain cognizant of the psychological—believe it or not—costs associated with too much engagement with computers. 

Additionally, while technology expands knowledge and awareness of the current world, it can also disconnect individuals from their physical surroundings. With the reliance on digital means of communication, people have a tendency to disconnect from their physical environments and, therefore, the people and relationships within them.

For these reasons, I believe it is important to encourage individuals of all ages to use computers and technology in moderation. We must be mindful of the screen time allotted to engage with these machines, and establish habits that allow individuals, especially children, to maintain a proper balance between computer involvement and physical relationships and activities. 

Regards,
[Your name]
