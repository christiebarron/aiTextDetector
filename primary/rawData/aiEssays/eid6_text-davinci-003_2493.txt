The Empire State Building was a monumental achievement of the early twentieth century, the tallest building in the world at the time of its completion in 1931. The ambitious design of the building included plans for allowing dirigibles – primitive airships – to dock at the top of the building. However, this innovative engineering endeavour was beset by numerous obstacles and ultimately failed. This essay discusses the key obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Firstly, one of the biggest obstacles was the technical difficulty of the engineering. A platform had to be constructed at the top of the building to accommodate the docking manoeuvre. This platform had to be suspended on cables connected to the building’s masthead to minimise the risk of damage to the structure, yet without compromising the safety of the dirigible or its passengers. This was further complicated by the strong air currents around the structure, making precise manoeuvring of the airship particularly difficult.

Furthermore, the mooring platform itself presented its own set of challenges. It had to be precisely levelled and fitted with structural components such as landing gear to support the airship, as well as to provide a comfortable area for disembarking passengers. The construction was technically challenging and high-carbide steel had to be used for its framework as it was the only material light and strong enough for the platform.

A third issue was that of cost. As a result of the technical complexity of the construction, the project proved to be very costly, an obstacle the builders could ill afford in the midst of a depression. Despite its potential to revolution
