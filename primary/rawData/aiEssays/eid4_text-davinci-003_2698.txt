The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho has a powerful message: never give up. Throughout the book, the protagonist Hope is struggling with her exams, her family life, and her identity. Through the novel, Hope learns to accept herself and to trust her inner strength to make it through tough times. 

The final line of the book emphasizes the idea of resilience and hope: as the snows melt and the geese come back and the Hibiscus begins to bud, Hope will take that test again. The line is an ode to the resilience she must have developed in order to make it through the winter. It implies that although things may not have gone perfectly in the winter, Hope can still find hope and strive to achieve her goals in the spring. 

This is an important theme in the book—the idea that challenge, struggle, and strife can make you stronger. Additionally, it’s a gentle reminder that life will always have its ups and downs, but with resilience and courage you’ll be able to move forward and progress. 

Hope’s story is an inspiring one, and even though she has faced difficult times and struggles, she hasn’t given up. Instead she has decided to keep going and work harder than ever before to pass her tests and build a life of her own. This sentiment is echoed throughout the book, and the ending is a reminder that even when everything seems overwhelming and you feel like giving up, you can still strive for success and keep pushing forward.
