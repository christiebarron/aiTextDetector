I remember the time my brother got stuck in a tree. He was stubbornly trying to make it to the top, but the branches were just too weak. I could see he was getting frustrated, but I stayed patient.

I calmly reminded him that he might break the tree if he keeps trying, and that we should go get help. After some convincing, he eventually agreed and I helped him down. 

We went over to my neighbour's house and asked if they had a ladder. Luckily, they did and they brought it around to our yard. I watched patiently as my brother climbed up the ladder even higher than he was in the tree â€” I knew he wouldn't give up that easily.

I let him take his time, although it seemed like forever. He eventually made it to the top and his cheeks were glowing a bright pink from all of the exertion.

It was a relief when he finally made it down, and I was glad that I stayed patient instead of letting my panic take over. We made a lifetime memory that day, and it showed me just how important it is to stay patient no matter the circumstance.
