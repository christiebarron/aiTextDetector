I remember a time I was very patient. It was a few years ago when I had just started dating my now husband. I had always been an independent person, so it was hard for me to depend on someone else. I was uncomfortable asking him for help with anything and I was used to managing everything on my own. 

One day, my car broke down and I was stranded at a gas station with no way to get home. It was late at night and no one else was around. I called him and he immediately came to my rescue. I was so embarrassed that I had to ask for help, but he was kind, patient and understanding. He didn't rush me or make me feel guilty. Instead, he patiently waited while I got myself together, he towed my car and he even gave me a ride home. 

His kindness that day really touched me. It showed me that I can depend on him, and it taught me that it was okay to ask for help. That experience showed me just how patient and understanding he could be, and I am so grateful to have him in my life.
