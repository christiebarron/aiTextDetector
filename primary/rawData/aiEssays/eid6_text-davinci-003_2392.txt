The possibility of the Empire State Building permitting the docking of dirigibles posed a unique set of obstacles that the builders of the iconic building had to overcome. Primarily, the Empire State Building was designed to be a traditional skyscraper, not a place for airplanes or airships to dock. As a result, the builders faced difficulties in creating an appropriate structure for the dirigibles, as well as allowing them access to the building.

The primary obstacle faced by the builders was creating a strong and reliable structure suitable for the heavy airships to dock safely at the Empire State Building. To achieve this, the designers had to devise a complex system of mooring masts, suspension cables, and a cabin for passengers. They also had to construct a steel wind sail around the mooring mast to provide a launch and landing platform for the dirigibles. This complicated and unique structure was a large undertaking that took considerable planning and effort to build. 

Another important obstacle was providing access to the platform. A network of cabins, lifts, and ladders had to be set up so that passengers could board and exit the airship. Electricity and natural gas had to be provided to power the airships and their machinery, while the roof had to be reinforced to provide a safe passage for the dirigibles.

Finally, the height of the building posed a unique challenge - high winds at the Empire State Buildingâ€™s altitude could make take-offs and landings very difficult for the dirigibles. To solve this, the designers had to figure out a way to reduce the air speed and turbulence around
