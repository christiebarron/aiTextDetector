In Joe Kurmaskiâ€™s story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a crucial role in both the cyclist's experience and the overall narrative. The cyclist rides through a rural Michigan landscape with plenty of hills, winding roads and muddy trails, creating an atmosphere of both beauty and danger. 

The physical features of the setting, such as the hills, winding roads, and the muddy trails, provide the cyclist with both challenge and opportunity. The hills challenge the cyclist to use his strength and skill to navigate them, and the winding roads provide a unique and interesting landscape to explore. As a result, the cyclist is able to engage with the setting and feel as though he is really connected to the natural world. 

The ruggedness of the roads also serves to create a sense of palpable tension and danger in the story. Interspersed with these winding roads are water-filled pits and other obstacles, which the cyclist must navigate with care if he wants to survive. The muddy trails also force the cyclist to face his fear of getting stuck in the mud. This provides additional tension and danger to the story, which helps to raise the stakes for the cyclist and add further excitement to the narrative.
