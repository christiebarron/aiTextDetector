Dear Editor,

In the modern digital age, the role of computers has become increasingly vital in the lives of many people. From helping with communication to providing us with a repository of knowledge, it is impossible to deny the role of these devices in our lives. However, there is an ongoing debate over the effects of relying heavily on computers.

Personally, I believe that computer usage is not without its drawbacks. While a computer can provide a sense of convenience and make our lives easier, one must be careful to not become overly reliant on it. Many people are easily distracted by the entertainment and activities available on a computer, and this can lead to decreased productivity and missed opportunities.

Furthermore, computers can also lead to heightened levels of stress, as people strive to keep up with the latest technologies. This can have a seriously negative impact on mental wellbeing. Constant computer use can also lead to various health issues, such as poor posture, eye strain and headaches.

It is understandable that the use of computers is essential in the modern age. People must, however, be aware of the potential negative aspects of relying too heavily on computers, and make sure to practice moderation in their computer usage.

I hope that readers will take my opinion on the effects of computers into consideration. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
