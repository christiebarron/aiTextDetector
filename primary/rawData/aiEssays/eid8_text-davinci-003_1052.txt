I remember the first time I laughed with my best friend. We were in high school, and had plans to go the movies with a group of friends. As we were getting ready to leave, I pulled out my bright green coat, which was covered in cartoon doodles, and he burst out laughing.

"Where in the world did you get this coat? It's amazing!" he said between chuckles.

I just laughed and shrugged, having no real explanation for the coat, other than that it was a Christmas present from my aunt.

We couldn't stop laughing at my obnoxious coat all the way to the movies. Every time I put it on all of our friends in the theater would start laughing, and it became a running joke over the entire duration of the movie.

Now whenever I pull out that coat and laugh at it with my friend, it's a reminder of our friendship, and all of the fun times we've had over the years. Laughter brings us closer togetherâ€”no matter what challenges life throws at us.
