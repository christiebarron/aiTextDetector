I was volunteering at a soup kitchen in the city recently and a few of my colleagues were getting anxious. We had been at the kitchen for a few hours already and were all exhausted, but more homeless people were showing up expecting to be fed. 

We began to get overwhelmed as the number of people increased, and we were running low on food. We eventually reached a point where we had to start rationing the food. A few of us got into an argument while trying to figure out how to do this. 

In this tense atmosphere, one of my colleagues, Tom, stood up and calmly suggested that everyone take a few minutes to just breathe and think about what to do. Nobody responded, but we all stopped arguing and no one seemed willing to speak. 

Tom then calmly stated that we should all remain patient, listen to each other’s ideas and work together to find a solution. We all agreed and eventually came up with a plan to ration the food responsibly so that everyone could get something. 

Tom’s words and actions showed me just how important being patient can be in difficult situations. We could have easily let our tempers get the best of us and let the situation escalate, but Tom’s patience and understanding ensured that we worked together and eventually reached an agreement.
