I remember that one fateful summer night that changed my life forever. 

My family had recently moved to a new city and I had yet to make any friends. That night I was walking around the park, feeling so alone and wishing I hadn’t been so scared to make conversation with anyone else. 

I was on the verge of tears when I spotted another kid around my age looking at the stars. Casually, I sat down beside him and began gazing up too. We didn’t say anything for a few minutes, and I was about to get up and leave when he suddenly doubled over laughing at a joke in his head. 

The sound of his laughter was infectious, and before I knew it, I was laughing too. Our laughter got louder and louder until we were both in tears, both of us taking in each other’s presence and feeling strangely connected. 

We talked for hours until the sun began to rise, sharing stories about our families, our hopes, our dreams. By the time I had to head home, I had made a new lifelong friend. 

To this day, whenever I recall this memory, I’m almost always smiling. Laughter had introduced two strangers that night, and showed us that there was much more that bound us together than divided us.
