Dear Editor,

I’m writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As a society, we’ve become increasingly dependent on computers and technology. We use computers even in the most mundane aspects of our lives and it’s created a unique paradigm in which our lives are heavily intertwined with technology.

I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. On one hand, computers provide us with so much convenience and allow us to do things quicker and more efficiently. We can access almost any information we need instantly and communicate with people from all over the world. These are things that weren’t possible a few decades ago, and have enabled us to make giant leaps in technology and productivity.

However, there are also potential negative effects of computers and technology. Spending too much time on our devices can lead to health issues, posture problems, vision issues, stress, anxiety, and depression. In addition, it can be easy to become addicted to our devices, which can be a distraction from other activities and important tasks.

Ultimately, I believe that computers can be a great tool for learning and productivity, but should be used in moderation. And we should be aware of the potential risks posed by overusing them.

I hope this letter has helped to shed some light on how computers impact us, and I urge readers to consider the potential harms of computer overuse, as well as the potential benefits.
