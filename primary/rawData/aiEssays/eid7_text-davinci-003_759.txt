When I was a child, my parents and I moved to a new town. It was a bit overwhelming; all my familiar surroundings were gone and it took some time to adjust. 

Since I was starting in a new school, I was concerned about making friends. I was shy and didn't really want to talk to anyone, so I was nervous about approaching the other kids.

My mum saw how uncomfortable I was and offered some wise advice: "Be patient. Don't rush it. Start with small talk about school and your classes. Take it one step at a time, and eventually you'll find people that you can connect with."

I took her advice to heart and patiently made conversation with other students. Before I knew it, I had made a few really good friends and settled in at school.

In the end, being patient was the key to making new friends in a strange new place.
