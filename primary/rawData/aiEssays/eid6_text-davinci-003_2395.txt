The Empire State Building was designed in 1929 with the intention of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock, an extraordinary feat at the time. However, achieving this feat was a difficult task and builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to make the airship mooring a reality. 

The first obstacle was finding a mooring mast that was sturdy enough to hold a large airship. Conventional materials were deemed too weak to support the mass of an airship, so engineers sought out new materials to construct a mooring mast that could withstand the pressure of an airship’s weight. Eventually a steel-reinforced mast was constructed using a combination of steel and concrete, giving it the strength necessary to support an airship.

The next obstacle was constructing a mooring platform and other mechanisms that would allow an airship to securely dock. The platform needed to adequately cushion any shock the airship made upon contact and the mechanisms provided must be strong enough to prevent the ship from shifting or swaying during the docking process. Engineers designed a platform made of steel that could absorb the shock upon contact, as well as other mechanisms such as a retractable keel, steel cabling, and boom struts. 

The final obstacle was figuring out how the airship would reach the mooring platform in the first place. The airship had to navigate the skyscrapers of the city’s skyline, safely navigate the updrafts created by tall buildings, and make a smooth enough turn to dock without ripping the ship apart.
