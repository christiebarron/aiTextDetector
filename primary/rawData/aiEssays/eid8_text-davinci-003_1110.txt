I was having dinner with an old college friend recently. We hadn't seen each other in years and I was so excited to catch up. After dinner, we decided to go for a walk, to take in all the sights of the city we currently lived in. 

As we walked, we talked and laughed about all the memories we shared from college: the crazy classes we took, the ridiculousness that occurred at campus parties, and the severe misadventures we were always getting ourselves into. 

It felt so good to laugh and reconnect again. We stopped walking at one point just to laugh uncontrollably at one of our stories. We laughed so hard that people on the street stopped in their tracks to stare! It felt so great to momentarily forget all my troubles, laugh and just be in the moment with my old friend. 

After a while, we wiped our tears, gathered ourselves, and continued on our walk, smiling and chuckling at our own silliness! Iâ€™m so thankful for this reminder of the power of laughter and how it can bring people much closer in friendship.
