I remember a time when I had to be very patient. I was on a 14-hour flight and had been traveling for a long time already. Everyone on the plane seemed to be losing their patience and it started to get quite noisy. A baby who was sitting behind me had been screaming for the last two and a half hours without a break. A lot of the passengers started to get angry and irritated.

However, I decided to stay patient. I turned up the volume on my headphones and tried to forget about the noise. I kept telling myself that this was only a momentary inconvenience I had to deal with and that everything would be over soon. I reminded myself that the baby was probably just having a hard time dealing with the change in environment so I remained understanding and tolerant of their situation. 

In the end, the baby's cries eventually subsided and we were able to have a peaceful flight the rest of the way. I was glad that I had stayed patient throughout the ordeal. It was not easy, but it was worth it in the end.
