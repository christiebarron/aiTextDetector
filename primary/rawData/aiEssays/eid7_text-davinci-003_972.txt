It was a really busy day at the store I work at and I had been dealing with difficult customers all day. The last customer of the day had a lot of questions and kept making changes to their order. I was feeling impatient, as I wanted to get done with my shift and go home. 

However, I managed to keep my cool and be patient with the customer. I answered all their questions, made the adjustments they asked for and even helped them figure out a way to get a discount. As I watched them leave the store with a smile on their face, I was glad I had been so patient with them. Not only did I make someone's day, but I also proved to myself that I could manage difficult situations in a respectful and calm way.
