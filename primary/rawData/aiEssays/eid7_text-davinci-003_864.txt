I was having a particularly difficult day at work. I had run into several obstacles that I felt needed to be overcome in order to make the day successful. My supervisor had asked me to complete certain tasks that I felt took up too much of my time, and my patience was waning.

However, I took a deep breath and told myself to remain patient. I reminded myself that it’s better to be understanding and tolerant of difficult situations than to lash out. So I smiled, and nodded, and took on the tasks as best I could.

I eventually was able to complete all of the tasks in the time allotted, despite how difficult the day had seemed. I felt better having handled the situation with patience, and I was glad that I didn’t allow myself to grow frustrated and angry with the situation. It’s definitely a lesson I will remember for the future.
