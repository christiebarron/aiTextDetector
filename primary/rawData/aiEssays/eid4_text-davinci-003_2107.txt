In the poem “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the narrator reflects on a moment when her father had advised her to succeed on the math placement test at school. She remembers his words as she looks at a hibiscus flower, a reminder of the summer, in the freezing winter. Although her heart may have wanted to take the test and achieve success, the weather conditions and her family responsibilities restrict her from taking her chances.

The last few lines of the poem lead to a soft yet powerful ending. She talks of the hope that when the snows melt and the geese return, the hibiscus will bloom again, and she is hopeful that she can take the test then. The line indicates that that the narrator respects and follows her father’s advice and wants to fulfil his wishes but circumstances hinder her. By using this symbol of renewal and hope, the narrator is expressing that she knows that after a certain time she will have the ability to take the test and prove her ambition.

The poem concludes with a sentiment of optimism and hope supported by the image of the hibiscus, which stands for the warmth of summer. She desires to take the test when spring comes and the snows of winter have melted, similar to a new beginning when the circumstances that have restricted her from taking the test will have passed. This conveys a sense of determination and resilience, which suggest that she is patient and willing to wait until it is her time to pass the exam. The poem speaks to the countless challenges that many people around the world face, and yet remain hopeful
