I’ll never forget the time when my best friend and I had such a good laugh that it brought tears to my eyes. We had been out shopping for my cousin’s birthday present when I stumbled across an outrageous theme park hat. It was completely ridiculous looking and the fact that it even existed made me laugh out loud. 

Without even thinking, I bought the hat on a whim. When I had the cashier ringing it up, I was still chuckling and my friend noticed. 

The cashier must have thought we were crazy because he had a strange look on his face and we were conversing in a language he didn’t seem to understand. We were talking about how my friend would look in the hat, how funny it would be to the people in our family, and the wild stories that would come out of it.

My friend was laughing so hard her face was turning bright red, and soon we were both in a fit of hysterical laughter. We laughed until our stomachs ached, and tears filled our eyes. 

That day remains one of my fondest memories because, despite the hat being so ridiculous, it brought us so much joy. That thought alone sticks with me, that a silly hat could create a moment we both cherish and remember so vividly. That’s the power of laughter.
