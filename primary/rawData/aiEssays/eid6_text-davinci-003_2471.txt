The Empire State Building was originally designed to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. However, the builders of the building faced numerous obstacles to this goal. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many of these difficulties are outlined, from the technical challenges to cultural sensibilities. 

Before any dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building, the engineers had to first design the mast and its mooring system. The structure had to be built to exacting standards, both for the security of the ships and for the safety of those in the building. This meant that the mast had to be made from the strongest available materials, such as steel from the nearby Bethlehem Steel Mills. Furthermore, it needed to be tall enough for ships to clear the roof of the building, while also allowing a safe trajectory for proper docking. All of this presented quite the engineering challenge, one which was only overcome following the combined efforts of several architects and engineers. 

Social considerations also played a role in slowing progress on the mooring mast. For religious and cultural reasons, Jewish developers were opposed to the project, arguing that the building would be used for unsanctified purposes. This opposition was only overcome when the building was reconfigured to include a church, after which construction on the mooring mast resumed.
 
Another issue was the reaction of the public. Even once it was completed, people were wary of the elevated danger it posed. Simulations of the mooring process, along with promises of safe operation, finally convinced people to accept the introduction of the moor
