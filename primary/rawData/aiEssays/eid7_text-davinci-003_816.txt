I recently met someone who amazed me with their patience. My neighbor was moving away and they needed help to move all of their things out of their house. When I offered to help, I expected it to be an arduous task, but with my neighbor's patience it was anything but. Even though the process took several hours, they never complained or lost their patience.

When things didn't go the way they had planned, my neighbor simply adjusted with a smile and went with the flow. At one point, we tried to fit a large piece of furniture through the door, but it just would not fit. My neighbor could have become frustrated, but instead they simply suggested that we put the furniture out the window. With their calm demeanor and patient attitude, it felt like the move was done in no time. 

My neighbor taught me that no matter how difficult a situation seems to be, keeping a calm and patient attitude can make it much easier. I will always remember the experience of helping my neighbor move and think of all the patience that they had.
