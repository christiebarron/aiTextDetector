The Empire State Building, constructed in the heart of New York City in 1931, was one of the first skyscrapers to be designed with the intention of accommodating dirigibles. The architects, who had initially imagined the building to reach toward the clouds, desired to make the Empire State Building a stopover and unloading station for transcontinental and international dirigible flights. The realization of this dream brought several obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.

One of the most significant challenges to designing the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles was the mooring mast. This was an engineering feat, as the mast had to be tall and structurally secure enough to support the massive dirigibles, and yet be flexible enough to sway and adjust to the needs of the airship. Because of the intense wind in the area, the mast had to be able to weather hurricanes, blizzards, and thunderstorms. To do this, the engineers proposed integrating a ball-and-socket joint in the top of the mast, which would enable the dirigibles to adjust to the wind conditions. As a result, the mooring mast and the building itself were designed with a curved top and looped cables.

The second challenge posed in making the Empire State Building a docking station was in creating the airship docks. Dirigible docking technology was still relatively new, and so the engineers had to research the best methods for accommodating the large air crafts. Ultimately, they developed a plan for a two-tier system of lockouts, with the lower dock occupying the elevator shafts and the upper dock
