There I was, my childhood home after years of being away at college. I was catching up with my old friend, Chris, and I could hardly contain my excitement. We've known each other since we were little, so we had been through thick and thin together. 

Chris and I were walking through the back garden, remembering the times we had spent there as kids, when all of a sudden I tripped over a tree stump. Instead of getting angry, we both burst out laughing. It felt so good to laugh. And I remember thinking, 'This is why I needed to come homeâ€”to be able to laugh together like this.' 

In that moment, we both recognized how we completed each other. In that moment of laughter, I knew no matter how much time passed, our friendship could never be broken. I'll never forget that moment and the release of joy and happiness we shared.
