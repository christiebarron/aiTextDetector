The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" has a palpable effect on the cyclist. The traveller’s journey throughout the rough terrain is a challenge in its own right, describing a harsh landscape and foreboding skies. The setting encourages suspense and creates a feeling of dread as we follow the cyclist on a noble mission.

The remoteness of the location puts the cyclist in an isolated and vulnerable position. This feeling of being alone in a hostile environment adds to the sense of peril that the traveller will face on the journey. The cyclist’s struggle is further amplified by the bleak, lifeless terrain, which frequently breaks into ravines and juts with large rocks and boulders. These obstacles are large enough to cause a difficult journey and need to be navigated with skill and determination.

The weather and time of day are also mentioned in the setting, which suggests a typical day in the region. The clouds in the sky further create tension as they continually darken and obscure the horizon. The evening is falling, and with it an impending sense of danger. This creates a feeling of urgency as the cyclist strives to reach his destination.
