Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people over the years. With the invention of computers, our lives have become a lot easier, quicker and even more enjoyable.

One of the greatest advantages of computers is that they can drastically increase the efficiency of work. Students, professionals and business owners can now work faster and more accurately than ever before. Computers can also store massive amounts of information that can be retrieved quickly and accurately. With more efficient and accurate results, people can save time and get more done in a day.

Computers have also made it possible for people to easily communicate with each other from around the world. With popular social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other websites, people can easily stay connected with their friends and family regardless of distance.

Furthermore, computers have allowed people to access books, videos and music for free, which can be enjoyed anytime and anywhere. With such an abundant source of information, people are now more well-informed and can make better decisions in their daily lives.

In conclusion, computers have had a great impact on people in numerous ways. Computers have changed the way we communicate, learn, work and access entertainment. I believe that computers are an invaluable asset to our modern day lives and I hope that my readers would agree with me.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
