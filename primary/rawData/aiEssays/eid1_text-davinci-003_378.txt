Dear Editor,

I’m writing today in response to the idea that computers have a positive impact on our lives. I am of the opinion that computers can benefit us in a variety of ways, but they also can have some unintended negative consequences. 

On the plus side, computers allow us to access information quickly, communicate with people all over the world, gain skills in coding, and conduct business online. It is no doubt that computers provide us with tools and resources to become more productive.

However, it’s important to recognize the potential downside of computers. Excessive use of computers has been linked to a variety of health issues, such as increased stress and eye strain. As technology advances, it’s also increasingly difficult to prioritize face-to-face interactions with family and friends. Computers can also be used for nefarious purposes, like spreading malware or false information.

Given the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, I believe the most responsible approach is moderation. By setting limits and expectations for computer usage, we can ensure that it remains a helpful personal asset.

As a reader of this newspaper, I hope you will agree that although computers are a great resource, we must be mindful of how much time we spend using them. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
