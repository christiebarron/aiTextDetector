I have a longstanding joke with my best friend, Steve. Whenever we're out at a restaurant, Steve will ask, "Do you want to split a dessert?" and I'll respond, "Are you asking me out on a date? Because I don't date desserts."

Whenever I say that, Steve and I burst out laughing.

It's really the only joke I have, but it never fails to make us laugh. The phrase has become so associated with our friendship, people who don't even know us have heard about it.

Whenever Steve and I are together and I start to feel glum, I know I can rely on that joke to bring a smile to both of our faces. 

Laughter is essential to the bond between us – it's the way we communicate love and understanding for one another – and that joke is a reminder of how far our friendship has come, and how strong it will remain for years to come.
