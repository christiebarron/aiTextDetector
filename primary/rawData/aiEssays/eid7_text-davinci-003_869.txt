I pulled up to the grocery store expecting to be in and out quickly. However, I quickly found out that I was wrong. It seemed as though the checkout line was never-ending. 

At first, I had wanted to complain. But then I reminded myself to be patient. So instead of feeling frustrated and grumbling, I remained positive and kept my composure. 

After what felt like an eternity, the line began to move. Gradually, I started to make my way through. I noticed that the elderly man in front of me was moving slowly and taking his time. Instead of getting frustrated, I let him go at his own pace. 

My patience paid off. Eventually, the line shortened and he was able to get through before me. His daughter sent me a smile and "thank you" as she helped him out of the store. Seeing her appreciation made the wait worthwhile. 

By that point, I had already been in the store for nearly an hour. I had expected the journey to be one thing, but it ended up being another. Although it was frustrating at times, I'm proud of myself for maintaining patience.
