I was once in a very difficult situation at school. My teacher had given us a really tough math test and I had not studied enough. I knew that I was in serious trouble. 

When the test was over, instead of berating me, my teacher called me aside and sat me down for a talk. She encouraged me to work hard and do better next time. She even gave me a few extra days to redo the questions I got wrong and clarify any doubts I had.

I was really surprised and touched with her patience. Her words of encouragement gave me the confidence to keep studying and move forward. I am so grateful to her for being so understanding and patient.
