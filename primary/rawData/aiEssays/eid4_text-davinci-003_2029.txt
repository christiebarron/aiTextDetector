At the end of ‘Winter Hibiscus’ by Minfong Ho, the protagonist is reflecting on a moment of her childhood. She was so desperate to escape getting an inoculation that she convinced herself that she was inedible. This moment had a powerful impact on the young girl and she links it to her hibiscus, which blooms pink and white in the shape of a star during the summer months. By connecting her moment of childish whimsy and the beauty of the hibiscus, she finds solace in a seemingly doomed situation.

The metaphor of the hibiscus serves as a reminder that after the winter passes, the spring will come and eventually the snow will melt and the geese will return. This is symbolic of the protagonist’s story, reminding us that all moments, even the ones that seem the most hopeless, will eventually pass. 

This idea is further reinforced by the protagonist's decision to take the test again when the hibiscus blooms. She is affirming that she can face the task in a future moment, when she is older and perhaps wiser. By committing herself to this decision when the moment is far away and seemingly out of her control, she is demonstrating her strength and resilience. She is accepting that the situation is out of her hands and recognizing that she can still move forward in the future.

Finally, the imagery of the hibiscus tying together the protagonist’s moment of childhood innocence and her future moment of courage is ultimately a powerful reminder that moments, both big and small, can shape us
