Dear Editor, 

As the world around us becomes ever more dependent on technology, computers have become an integral part of many people’s lives. As a result, there’s lots of debate over the effects that computers have on us – the potential harms and benefits that they bring. 

The potential harms of computers are often exaggerated, of course. Some people fear that increased reliance on technology can lead to a loss of jobs, or even a decrease in human intelligence. But many of these issues are overstated – for example, the invention of new technologies has historically created, not removed, jobs.

On the other hand, one cannot deny that computers have a positive effect on our day-to-day lives. They have made us more efficient and connected, allowing us to store massive amounts of data, communicate quickly and easily with each other, and gain access to unprecedented amounts of information.

In my opinion, the benefits that computers have brought us far outweigh the potential harms. Computers have vastly improved our lives, and I believe we should embrace – not fear – the technological advances that the future will bring.

Sincerely, 

[Name]
