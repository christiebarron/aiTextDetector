I was volunteering at a local soup kitchen when an elderly woman arrived and asked for a meal. She seemed very disoriented, and it was clear to me that she was having a difficult time getting her words out. 

Despite her confusion, she was very polite and attempted to explain what she needed. I could tell from her demeanor that she was embarrassed and didn't want to cause a scene.

I stayed calm and listened to her as she tried her best to communicate her request. I offered her a chair and told her it was okay to take her time. Out of respect and compassion, I also gave her some space to process her thoughts and figure out what to say. 

Although it took us longer than usual, we were eventually able to determine what meal she wanted. It was a long process, but we made it through in the end. I was proud of myself for responding with patience and understanding, despite the difficult situation.
