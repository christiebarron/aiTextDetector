In Joe Kurmaski's story, 'Rough Road Ahead', the cyclist experiences a particularly challenging journey due to the features of the setting. 

The environment is described as a "rough, mountainous terrain" and the cyclist has to carry a heavy load as he pedals up the inclines. This is exaggerated by an additional challenge of poor visibility due to a thick fog that has enveloped the area. The fog not only makes the path ahead even harder to discern, but it also reduces the amount of sunlight available to warm and energize him. Additionally, the cyclist is hindered by sharp rocks penetrating his skin, creating chafing abrasions.

The rough road also tests the cyclist's physical and mental power as he is continuously challenged by the various obstacles. He must contend with the physical difficulty of having to control his bike through tight, winding turns as well as wading through deep pools of mud.
