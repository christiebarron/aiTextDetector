I was walking through a crowded mall recently when I realized I had left my wallet at home. It had all my credit cards, money, and ID in it, so I was left without any way to buy anything. 

I was starting to feel frustrated, but then I remembered something my mom always told me growing up. She would always say, "Be patient," and that is exactly what I tried to do in this situation. 

I decided to just take a few deep breaths and patiently wait for the situation to work itself out instead of panicking. After a few minutes I remembered that a friend of mine had given me their number in case of emergency. So I called them and sure enough, they were able to come pick me up and take me back to my house to get my wallet.

While I waited for my friend to come get me, I was able to just relax and enjoy my surroundings. I noticed the hustle and bustle of shoppers and the cheerful holiday music that was playing.

It was amazing to see that despite my situation, I didn't get too worked up. I was able to stay patient and just enjoy a moment of peace. It was a great reminder of how staying patient can make a difficult situation much easier to deal with.
