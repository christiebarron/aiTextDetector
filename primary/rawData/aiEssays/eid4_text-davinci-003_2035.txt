The ending to Minfong Ho’s ‘Winter Hibiscus’ conveys a powerful message about resilience and determination despite difficult circumstances. This theme appears to be inspired by the adult narrator’s experiences of trying to pass her English proficiency test while simultaneously taking care of her disabled brother.

The narrator’s circumstances are reflected in the image of the hibiscus suspended in the snow at the end of the poem. This symbolizes the narrator’s difficult times of trying to pass the test, and her commitment to not give up despite the circumstances. Through this poem, Ho encourages the reader to not be deterred by life’s various difficulties, but to find hope in the coming spring and use the opportunity to try again.

The narrator’s determination to not give up is also shown through her remarks that ‘when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again’. This statement reflects the narrator’s resilience, emphasizing her desire to persevere and attempt the test yet again when she finds the right opportunity. The message reflects the idea that one should never give up, but practice resilience and keep going to reach the desired goal.

In conclusion, ‘Winter Hibiscus’ through its strong message of resilience and determination despite difficult circumstances is truly an inspiring piece. It serves as a source of motivation for readers to never give up and always strive for their goals no matter the circumstances.
