The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” effectively juxtaposes the fragility of the natural world with a sense of optimism for the future. In the final lines of the poem the narrator asks, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?” The imagery of the winter hibiscus, clutching to life as the harsh winter carries on, serves as a metaphor for resilience and hope.

Although the winter hibiscus may seem a fragile creature, existing in a cold environment, it serves as a reminder of the power of hope. In the same way, the narrator, facing an unknown challenge that lies ahead, finds hope in the image of the winter hibiscus. When the snows are no more and spring finally comes, the narrator is confident that they have the strength and resilience required to take “that test again” and move forward with their life.

In many ways, the winter hibiscus serves as a stark reminder of our own mortality. It is a delicate flower, struggling to survive in a hostile environment. Yet, with courage and resilience, the flower proves to be triumphant and ultimately blooms in the presence of the coming spring. In a similar fashion, the poem can be seen as an affirmation of courage and hope in the face of adversity. Similarly, the narrator of the poem is also able to draw on that same source of courage and strength to venture out into the future
