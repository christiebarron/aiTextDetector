The ending of the poem “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho implies that the narrator has connected her self worth to success in an academic test. The poem’s climax is when the narrator finds a wilted hibiscus small enough to fit in her pocket which she takes as a reminder that she can revive her dreams by persevering. The final line “then I will take that test again” is a promise to the hibiscus and symbolically, to herself that another chance awaits.

The ending serves to reinforce the power of hope, a vital tool in tough times. The narrator’s ambition was temporarily dashed when the winter arrived, precursing failure in her test. The winter symbolizes the darkness which often befalls individuals prior to a major change: a darkness indicating hopelessness and a lowering of morale, even though the darkness may just be the prelude to a new phase. Here, the winter symbolizes the low feeling of the narrator prior to her regrouping and reinvigoration. The hibiscus serves as a reminder of the seasonal cycles (“when the snows melt", “when they come back in the spring") and the consequent new beginnings each presents. The buds and florets of the hibiscus represent the narrator’s hopes for the future - as is typical for plants, the hibiscus will wait for the spring before fully blossoming, and so does the narrator’s hope wait for her taking the test again.
