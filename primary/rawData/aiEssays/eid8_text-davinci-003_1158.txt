I had been friends with Ryan for a few months already, and I was eager to deepen the connection between us. On a typical day, we would chat mindlessly about the regular topics like our families, school or work, and then the conversation would usually fizzle out. We weren't exactly avoiding uncomfortable topics, but something had to be said to really make the relationship spark.

One day, after yet another conversation that felt a bit stale, I decided to make an effort to do something different. I was feeling brave, so I started to tell a story about a funny experience I had back in high school. It was a silly story, involving a rather stupid action I took that ended in me with cake all over my face.

Of course, I expected the worst: awkwardness, or a polite chuckle or something. But the response I got was the most wonderful surprise. Instead of a polite smile or something, Ryan burst into laughter. It wasn't laughter out of politeness or anything, it was genuine and full of life. 

It was the kind of laughter that comes when someone is truly letting go, without any barriers or expectations. I had never felt more connected to someone in my life. 

Since that day, laughter has become an important part of our relationship. We both know that if a conversation is having a difficult time getting off the ground, humor is the answer. A few jokes or stories may be the remedy, but at the end of the day it's the shared laughter that solidifies our connection.
