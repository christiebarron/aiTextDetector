The ending of Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” speaks to the power of nature and hope for the future. The speaker in the poem talks about how the hibiscus he has been tending to has been long forgotten and discarded in the cold winter, but he refuses to give up hope that the same flower will one day bloom again in the spring. In this way, he finds solace in the idea that all things must pass, just as winter will pass and the hibiscus will bloom again.

The speaker, while standing in the cold winter and looking at the dormant flower, finds a reminder within the cycle of life and death, which calls him to action. He finds a sense of optimism in the thought that one day, he will take the same test again, having survived the cold winter. This is a reminder that no matter how bleak the situation may appear, there is always the potential for success and rebirth. 

The speaker's perspective on the cycle of life and death is reflective of a larger societal attitude in the world: no matter how bad the situation may be, there is a chance for growth and rebirth. The speaker is determined to see the potential for success, even in the face of bleakness. He uses the hibiscus as a metaphor for his own perseverance and optimism, and this serves to inspire the audience to push through their own struggles and strive towards betterment. He reminds us all that even when the odds seem insurmountable, we can persevere.
