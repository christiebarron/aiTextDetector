I'm usually a very impatient person, but there was one time that I was actually able to be patient. One day my daughter and I were waiting in line to see a movie. It was already sold out, but luckily there were a few tickets left for the showing a few hours later. As we were waiting to buy the tickets, I noticed that the ticket seller was moving incredibly slowly. I was so anxious to get back home, but I forced myself to remain calm. After what felt like forever, the ticket seller finally finished with the customer ahead of us and we were finally able to buy our tickets. As I looked over at my daughter, I could see that she was patiently waiting without complaint. That is when I realized that I needed to be more like her and work on being more patient. It was a valuable lesson that I'll never forget.
