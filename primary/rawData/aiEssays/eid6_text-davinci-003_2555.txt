The builders of the Empire State Building had an ambitious plan to make the building accommodating to dirigibles and their passengers. However, in order to bring this plan to fruition, they had to overcome multiple obstacles.

One of the main obstacles was the fact that the Empire State Building was designed for office space, not accommodations for airships like dirigibles. This hindered the plans for a docking mast, as the builders had to come up with alternative solutions to facilitate the docking of the dirigibles. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted points out in her book, “The Mooring Mast,” they determined that the place they intended on putting the mooring mast needed to be twice as strong as the rest of the building. Thus, they had to find a way to reinforce the area in order to support the weight of a docked dirigible.

In addition, the builders had to find a way to make the mast accessibly for the dirigibles and to enable the airships to dock at times of less than ideal weather conditions. This meant that the mast needed to be reinforced as well as equipped with an adequate length of leverage. To accomplish this, the builders ultimately chose to use a complex system of counterweights and pulleys to support the strength of the mast.

Although the designers of the building initially thought that the mooring mast would be a small part of the overall design, it was in fact a relatively large feature that required major changes to the building structure’s engineering. This posed a significant challenge as they had to make sure that the mast was constructed safely
