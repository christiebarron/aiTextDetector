When I was eleven, I became friends with a girl named Emily in my sixth-grade class. We got along well and quickly developed a very close bond. One day, Emily and I were at my house playing a board game. We had been having a good time, but we were both feeling pretty bored halfway through the game.

Suddenly, Emily erupted into a fit of giggles. I asked her what was so funny, and she just laughed even harder. After a minute or two, she finally let me in on the joke: she had sneakily spelled out a very silly word (it was penguin-flabbergast) on the board game. I started laughing too, and soon we were cracking up for what felt like hours.

That laughter brought us even closer together, and from that moment on we were practically joined at the hip. We shared our secrets, dreams and worries with each other and helped one another through difficult times. We grew up together, but that day of laughter--and the bond that it formed--has stayed with us both to this day.
