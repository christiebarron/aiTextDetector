The builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. This plan was highly ambitious and had never been done before, making it a risky venture. The first obstacle was convincing the public to believe in such an idea. Although there had been previous tales of aeronauts docking their balloons on top of rural buildings, installing a mooring mast to the top of a skyscraper presented a much greater effort capable of becoming a grand feat of ingenuity. 

The next obstacle was the actual installation of the mooring mast. It needed to be tall, lightweight, and strong enough to support the airship. Since the Empire State Building was already completed, the mast needed to be built separately and then hoisted up to the roof, which would be no easy feat. The mast was over 100 feet tall and made of a combination of steel and wood. The necessary equipment to hoist the mast up to the roof was also extremely heavy and intricate, which made the task difficult to manage.

The last obstacle was public safety. One of the most crucial considerations when building something of this magnitude was the danger it could pose to those in the vicinity. This was especially true when it came to dirigibles, which used both lighter-than-air technology and combustible fuel. With such potential risks, proper installation and maintenance of the mooring mast had to be enforced to ensure both public and pilot safety. To further reduce the risks, a 34-ton concrete block nicknamed “Mother Tucker” was added at the base of the mast so it
