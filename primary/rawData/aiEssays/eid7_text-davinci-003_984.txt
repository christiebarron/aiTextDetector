I recently had a friend come to stay with me while they were visiting my city. The day they arrived, they had quite a lot of luggage, and it ended up taking much longer to get them settled than I had planned. I could tell my friend was getting frustrated, but I knew that if I just remained patient and calm, I could help make the situation easier for both of us. So, I took a few deep breaths and tried to remain patient and understanding.

I reminded myself that my friend had traveled a long way, and that this was probably just an overwhelming situation. I helped them get settled and before too long, we were both in more comfortable and happier places. My patience had helped the situation and we were able to move past the initial delay with no hard feelings.
