My friends and I had always had a special bond growing up – our sense of humor was so in sync that it was almost like we could communicate without words. And that was especially true in the summer of my grade eight year. 

It started off innocently enough; I was at the local food stand with a couple of my friends, waiting in line for a slice of pizza. We were joking around, as usual, when we started trading playground jokes that we had all heard from the older kids at school. All of us were kind of nervous, because none of us wanted to mess up any of the punchlines – we only had one chance to get it right. 

After several attempts, I finally nailed the punchline of a particularly funny joke, and I started laughing hysterically. My friends started laughing too, and before we knew it, the entire line up of people waiting in front of us started to crack up too. Even the lady at the counter couldn't help but giggle! 

We all had a good time that day, and from then on, laughter was our way of bridging the gap between us. It didn't matter if we were up to no good or simply passing the time – we found that laughter was always the best way to bring a smile to our faces.
