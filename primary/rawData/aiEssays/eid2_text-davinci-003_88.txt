The issue of censorship in libraries has been hotly debated in recent years. On the one hand, there is an argument that certain materials should not be made available in libraries if they are deemed offensive or inappropriate. On the other, many believe libraries should serve as institutions of learning, and that access to diverse materials should be an unconditional right.

One argument in favor of censorship suggests that certain materials may contain content that is objectionable to some readers, and therefore should not be made available for public consumption. This reasoning is understandable, however, such materials have literary, historic, or artistic value which cannot be denied. Forbidding access to such materials could prove to be a violation of free speech. 

Furthermore, libraries serve critical roles in the education of a culture, and should be left to the discretion of individual users. It is not fair to limit access to materials based on cultural standards, or the principles of a majority. To do so would be to deny citizens the opportunity to explore different points of view, or to gain insight into the various perspectives which comprise a society.

In addition, censorship in libraries can lead to a skewing of the facts, as only certain information would be made available to readers. Possibilities that certain theories or stories may contradict accepted beliefs should remain open, as a path to the verification of ideas. To remove the content that causes a debate is to silence the argument, and limit prosperity and open dialogue.

In conclusion, censorship in libraries can have a negative impact on the intellectual pursuits of citizens. Rather than limit access to certain materials, libraries should be regarded as resources for learning,
