It was a typical night after dinner at my parents’ house and my brother and I were in the living room watching a movie and playing around. My brother was a silly one, always coming up with silly jokes and trying to make me laugh. I was always a bit more serious, so I was trying my best to muster up some laughter for him.

On this particular night, he was telling me some random joke he had heard from a friend and I couldn’t help but look off to one side and start to giggle before I even knew what was happening. Then he just started laughing and repeating the joke over and over, trying to get me to laugh even louder. We both started to laugh and we just ended up rolling on the floor, barely being able to catch our breath. 

My parents’ living room had suddenly become an arena for our silly laughter, and all I had to do was let go and just enjoy it. Even after the laughter died down, I felt so much closer to not only my brother, but my parents as well. We were all laughing together and it was just so amazing how a few minutes of laughter brought us all together in a way we hadn’t been in a long time. 

Laughter can be such a powerful thing and that night I learned that it truly is the shortest distance between two people—or even multiple people.
