When I was in middle school, I had a really hard time with math. It didn't matter how much practice I had, I was always feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. It seemed like no matter what I did to try to understand the concept, I just couldn't get it. 

My parents could see that I was struggling and they promised to help me however they could. My mom would spend hours going over the same math problems with me, and my dad would provide encouragement and other strategies to try to make the concepts easier to understand. 

It wasn't an overnight fix, and at times it felt like I was making no progress. But despite the slow progress, my parents were patient and understanding. They were always there to help me and never got frustrated or angry. After months of hard work and dedication, I finally started to understand math and be able to do it without help. 

I'm so grateful for my parents' patience and support while I was learning math. Without them, I'm sure I would not have been able to make progress.
