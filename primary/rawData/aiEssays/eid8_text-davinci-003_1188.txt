As I walked through the park, I noticed a young couple sitting on a bench together. They were both smiling and laughing together and it made me smile to see it. 

I slowly walked closer and instantly noticed that they had a deep and meaningful connection. I wasn't sure what they were laughing about, but somehow I knew it was something special. 

I decided to stay for a bit and just enjoy the beautiful moment between them. As I stood there listening to their laughter, I could feel the love in the air. They had a bond, and their laughter only made the love more visible. 

I couldn't help but laugh along with them. I was so caught up in the moment that I didn't even realize when I started laughing. I thought they would be upset, but they both looked up at me and smiled. 

The girl said, "Welcome, we're glad you joined us! We've been laughing over a photo album we just made. We're celebrating the memories we've made together". 

I was taken aback by their kindness and grateful to have had the chance to experience such a beautiful moment. The laughter was infectious and I had to admit that it was definitely the shortest distance between two people.
