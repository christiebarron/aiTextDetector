I remember one time when I was with my best friend and we had plans to go to the movies. We were waiting in line and trying to decide on a movie to watch when my friend started to act silly, making all different facial expressions and silly noises. I started to laugh and before I knew it, we had a full-on laugh attack. 

The people around us started to laugh, too, and pretty soon the entire line was laughing and enjoying the moment with us. It felt like we were all connected in this one shared moment of laughter. We finally decided on a movie, but the memory of that moment still stays with me to this day.

Laughter is an amazing thing that can bridge any gap between friends, strangers, and even nations. It was a great reminder of how powerful laughter can be and how it can create a sense of connection between people.
