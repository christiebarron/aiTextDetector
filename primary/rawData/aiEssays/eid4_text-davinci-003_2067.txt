“Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho is an alluring poem that deals with themes of winter, resilience, and hope. The titular winter hibiscus serves as a powerful symbol for perseverance throughout the poem. In the final two lines, Ho asks the reader to consider how much strength the flower will have come spring when the snows have melted and the geese have returned.

These lines serve to reinforce the idea that, similar to the hibiscus, humans are also capable of withstanding difficult circumstances and thriving in the end. This notion can be seen throughout the poem. At the start, the narrator expresses worry that the hibiscus will not be able to handle the winter and will “die to the cold”. However, halfway through the poem, the author begins to describe the hibiscus in terms of endurance, suggesting that the flower is “as strong as iron”. 

These lines operate as a metaphor for life’s unceasing complexity. Humans, like the hibiscus, often have to face adversity that may seem insurmountable, yet have the potential to overcome it. The narrator’s closing words are a reminder of the immense fortitude and perseverance found in nature and how it can be paralleled with that of the human experience. As humans, we can use the example of the winter hibiscus to embolden our own strategies for overcoming life’s difficulties. 

Ultimately, “Winter Hibiscus” serves as an inspiring story of resilience
