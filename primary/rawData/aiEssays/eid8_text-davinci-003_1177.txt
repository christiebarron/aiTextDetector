I remember that summer day like it was yesterday. I had decided to take my best friend for an outdoor outing, so we packed a few snacks and headed to the nearest park. Once we got there, the sun was already starting to set, but the laughter that filled the air lasted much longer than the daylight.

The park was full of families talking, kids playing and love in the air. We laid a blanket on the grass and just laid there, chatting and catching up on each others' lives. I still remember how we began to laugh hysterically at the silliest of things â€” it felt as if there was no way we could contain our joy.

The conversation and laughter lasted for what seemed like hours, and when the stars finally began to come out, we knew it was time to go home. 

As we started to leave, I noticed a group of young teens glancing our way. Suddenly, one of them shouted out "You two seem like a couple!" while the others around him giggled. We laughed uncontrollably, not knowing what we should say in response. 

It still brings a smile to my face when I remember that day, since it was the sheer joy of laughter that turned two strangers into friends.
