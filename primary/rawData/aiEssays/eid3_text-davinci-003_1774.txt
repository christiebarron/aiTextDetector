In the poem "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays a key role in the poem's development as it represents the cyclist's struggle. The bike path is described as hilly and rugged: "The slings and arrows of outrageous hills/ Uphill, downhill, the tortuous trail." The environment is inhospitable, with dips and peaks making it more challenging. The cyclist is also faced with obstacles such as potholes and branchesâ€”"a rattling collection of junk and twigs./ Rust, grime, and an occasional noose of thorns." The lack of support and abundance of obstacles provide an excellent metaphor for the cyclist's journey, as he must persist despite the difficulties he encounters.

The cyclist, however, is determined to conquer the difficult terrain and remain positive. To symbolise his determination, the cyclist is described as having "an armor of inquisitiveness and an inner glee," which is further represented by the internal monologue: "Bless these roads and the exercise they give!/ Someone has to blaze these trails of life". This use of language and imagery demonstrate the cyclist's resilience in the face of adversity, despite the harshness of the environment.
