I recently went out to dinner with my best friend and our significant others.  It was the perfect chance for us to catch up and really make the most of our rare time together. 

Everything was going great until my friend's date, who we'll call Steve, said something really stupid and we all burst into laughter. By then we were all pretty hungry and Steve's confused expression only made us laugh harder.

My friend, who we'll call Alice, struggled to compose herself and tried to explain to Steve why the group was laughing so hard. It was easy to see the embarrassment in his eyes, until Alice finally said something so ridiculous that Steve couldn't help but join in on the laughter. 

Once we all calmed down, Steve realized that the laughter was a sign of acceptance and actually thanked us for making him feel so included. We could not have been any happier for him. 

Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people and that night we learned just how much it can do to bring people together.  We laughed and talked the night away, and our friendship only grew stronger through it.
