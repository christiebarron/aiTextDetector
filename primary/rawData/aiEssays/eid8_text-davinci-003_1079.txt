My first date with my now husband wasn't a traditional date. We had been at a field party with some mutual friends, when I noticed him making a funny face at me from across the room. It immediately made me smile. When I went to introduce myself, we both started laughing uncontrollably. We laughed so hard that I ended up snorting and then we laughed even harder. 

We ended up talking for hours about random things. We talked about our favorite books and movies, our families and our dreams for the future. The whole time we just kept laughing, even if the conversation was serious. 

We ended up hitting it off and decided to go out on a real date. Four years later, we're still laughing and snorting together. We laugh constantly and it's a reminder of our first meeting, and how far we've come since then.
