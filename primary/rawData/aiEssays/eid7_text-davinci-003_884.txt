I recently experienced a situation in which I had to be patient. I was on a long plane ride from England to the United States. About two hours into the flight, my baby started to cry and scream. While I was worried that other passengers around me were going to be annoyed, they showed me tremendous patience and compassion. Instead of getting angry or frustrated, they were kind, and offered me helpful advice on how to keep my baby as comfortable as possible. Their patience made the journey much more enjoyable and eased my worry significantly.
