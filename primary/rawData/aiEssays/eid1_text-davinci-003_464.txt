Dear Editor:

As technology continues to grow and advance, the presence of computers in our daily lives only continues to expand. From banking to shopping, the average person uses computers to organize and complete their lives in a manner that was not possible only a few decades ago. However, this progress can bring both positive and negative effects to the people who use these technologies. I believe that, on balance, the effects of computers on people are beneficial.

One of the most obvious benefits to computer technology is the convenience of being able to access information quickly. From online classes to review sites, it is much easier to research a topic today than it was before personal computing became commonplace. Additionally, computers can help to automate and streamline mundane tasks, such as banking and accounting, that would require a great deal of time to complete without a computer.

The vast capabilities of computers have enabled individuals and companies to excel in areas that used to be impossible. In business, computers have allowed people to track data and help analyze market trends more accurately than ever before. In education, computers have allowed students to explore vast topics from any location, and to collaborate more easily with peers from all over the world.

Unfortunately, technology has also presented some negative effects. Spending too much time on a computer can lead to physical health issues, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and eyestrain. cyberbullying and harassment have become rampant due to the ease of access caused by computer usage. In
