I was working in a customer service job at an electronics store. One day a customer came in carrying a laptop for repair. It quickly became obvious that this customer was very frustrated and angry. He kept complaining about how long it took for his laptop to be fixed and demanding immediate service from us.

I stayed calm and tried to be as understanding as possible. I assured him that the laptop would be fixed as soon as possible, and explained the process for getting it repaired. He kept getting progressively louder, and I could see that the other customers in the store were starting to get uncomfortable.

Seeing the situation escalating, I took the customer aside, assured him again that we were doing everything we could to get the laptop back to him, and offered him a free cup of coffee while he waited so that he didn't have to stand in the store while he waited. He accepted, and I went to make his coffee with a smile on my face. 

My customer service skills were tested that day, but I managed to remain patient and understanding in the face of his frustration. I believe that my patience made all the difference and was able to find a positive resolution to the situation.
