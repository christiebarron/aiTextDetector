The debate around censorship in libraries has been a long-standing, multifaceted one. From book banners trying to get controversial or racy literature removed to those advocating for free speech rights, there has always been a steady dialogue concerning what should or shouldn’t be allowed in libraries. 

Having personally experienced pressure from book banners, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if found offensive. While it’s true that libraries should strive to provide diverse content, this should not include materials that are deemed inappropriate for certain age groups, or which could evoke strong emotions that could lead to disruption or disrespect. 

If a book is found to be offensive or inappropriate, library staff should look into the reasons why it might have made its way onto the shelves, in order to ensure that it doesn’t happen again. However, the entire publication should not be removed; instead, it can be placed in a limited-access section where it is only available to people old enough to understand its content. 

It is also important to remember that censorship is subject to interpretation, and libraries have the right to decide what they consider offensive. The American Library Association has outlined several criteria which library staff can use when considering whether to censor certain materials. These criteria include relevance, accuracy, objectivity, copyright and intellectual property rights, and public opinion. 

Ultimately, I believe that libraries should be places that are open to discussion, debate, and intellectual exploration. In order to maintain this atmosphere, certain materials may need to be removed from public
