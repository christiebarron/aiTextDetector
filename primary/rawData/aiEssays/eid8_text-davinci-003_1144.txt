I remember one evening I went to visit my grandmother at her home. We had been close since I was a kid, so I always looked forward to visiting her whenever I could. 

When I arrived at her house, I couldn't help but notice the mischievous smile on her face.

"Come on in, Sweetheart," she said cheerfully. I could already tell that she was up to something.

I stepped into the living room and saw a toy train set lying across the floor. There were tracks and bright colored wooden pieces spread out everywhere!

"What's going on? Why are there toys here?" I asked.

My grandmother burst out laughing. That's when I knew she had something fun in mind for us. She then spread out a blanket on the living room rug and motioned for me to sit down.

We spent the next few hours building out the train tracks in all sorts of shapes, while my grandmother told me stories of her own childhood. Every now and then, she would pause just to chuckle at our silly construction. By the end of the night, it was almost impossible to tell how the tracks were put together, but we had laughed so much that our cheeks were sore.

Laughter has always been an important part of our relationship, and I'm thankful that I got to enjoy some of that special bond with my grandmother on train night.
