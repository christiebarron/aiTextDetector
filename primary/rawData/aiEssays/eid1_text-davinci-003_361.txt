To the Editor:

As a member of the local community, I am concerned about the effects computers have on people. There is no doubt that computers have had a major impact on our lives in recent years. They have made many tasks, from education to communication, easier and more efficient than ever before. 

However, I believe that this increased reliance on computers has caused some people to become overly dependant on them. Individuals often spend too much time on the internet or on social media and this can lead to feelings of depression or anxiety. It can also take away from important time that could be spent with family and friends.

Furthermore, the use of computers can reduce our ability to use critical thinking skills. We often come across false narratives or facts on the internet, but many individuals lack the ability to analyse and decipher them.

I urge readers to consider the potential consequences of being too dependent on computers. We should use technology to make our lives easier, but not to the point where it interferes with the other components of our lives. Constantly monitoring our screens can be detrimental to our health, social, and mental well-being.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
