I recently had a very trying experience at an airport. I was traveling with my family on vacation when we arrived at the airport we had to wait 4 hours for our plane to leave. It was a small airport and the wait was unfortunately in the middle of a hot summer day. I could feel my frustration start to rise and my patience beginning to fray as the minutes ticked away. 

My family was tired and getting hot and I knew if we didn't find a way to pass the time nothing good was going to come of it. So I attempted to focus on the positive. I knew there would be a great reward when we finally reached our destination so I did my best to stay positive and make the best of the situation. 

I pulled out some books and we all read and talked. We shared snacks and discussed our plans for the holiday. It wasn't ideal, but it felt important to keep the mood light and it made the time go by much quicker. 
 
At last, our plane was ready and we were able to board and head off on our holiday. Although it was a bit of an ordeal, my patience had paid off and I was grateful I had managed to stay so calm throughout. Being patient in this stressful situation was definitely worth it!
