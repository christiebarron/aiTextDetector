It can be used to silence political dissidents, to repress certain forms of expression, and to manipulate public opinion in favor of politically-driven agendas. Furthermore, the proposed action could be seen as a form of censorship by omission, whereby libraries are deprived of materials which some individuals find offensive. The purpose of a library is to offer access to a wide range of knowledge, not to limit it.
