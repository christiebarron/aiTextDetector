I remember the time I shared a laugh with my best friend like it was yesterday. We had been through a particularly tough few months, and we hadn't seen each other in nearly two weeks. As soon as I saw her, I was struck by how tired and worn down she looked. I just wanted to make her laugh. 

So, I decided to try my best to crack a joke or two. It took a while, and I had to tell a few really bad ones until I finally found one that actually made her laugh. It felt like a punch in the gut when I heard it â€” that sound of pure, genuine laughter. It was like I was taking a deep breath of air and finally feeling the relief of the pressure of the past few months. We were both ready to burst out laughing. 

We went on laughing for what felt like hours, but it was probably just a few minutes. In that time, something shifted; I could feel the weight and worry of the recent months start to ease up a little. We hugged each other tight, and neither of us wanted to let go.

Laughter was something that I had sorely missed, but it was also something that I never wanted to forget: how the sound of it could bring light into the darkest of days.
