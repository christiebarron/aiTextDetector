I remember being in seventh grade and having a group project to complete with my classmates. I was feeling very anxious as I had never worked with most of the people in my group before, and I was afraid I wouldn't fit in. We started discussing our project and everyone seemed to be on the same page. That is, until we started coming up with some off-the-wall ideas of what to include in the final presentation.

Someone suggested that we each bring a prop to use, which quickly turned into the group trying to come up with the most absurd thing each of us could possibly bring. Everyone started offering up ideas and I was starting to feel overwhelmed by the whole process. That's when one of my classmates suggested that he would bring his pet frog to class, which made everyone erupt in laughter.

At first, I was too embarrassed to join in, but the more I thought about it, the funnier the idea became. Eventually, I was howling with the rest of the group, and the tension that I had been feeling suddenly evaporated.

Not only did we manage to come up with an excellent presentation for our project, but we also had a great time planning it. I found myself in a better mood every time we had a project discussion, and I know it was because of the laughter we shared. Even though our school days are long gone, that moment still stands out in my mind, and it was that shared laughter which has stayed with me all these years.
