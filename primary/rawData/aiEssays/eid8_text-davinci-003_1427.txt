I was spending the evening with my best friend, catching up after not seeing each other for nearly a month. We were both sitting on the couch, enjoying some snacks and drinks, when she started to tell me about her workplace drama that was going on. One of her colleagues was having difficulties with his work and was receiving a lot of negative attention from the boss. She was telling me the whole story with a lot of animation, and I couldn't help but find it really funny. Before I knew it, I was laughing so hard that tears were coming to my eyes. And then she started laughing too, which made us both laugh even harder.

The situation was funny in and of itself, but it was the shared experience of laughter that made our friendship feel even more connected and strong. We continued to chat and joke around, and I could see that the stress of the day had been lifted away by our lighthearted moments. I even went away feeling happier and more refreshed than I had before I got there.

The funny thing is, I'm sure we both remember that moment in different ways. But I get it. I know that this is one of those moments that we'll never forget, and it was simply the shortest distance between us.
