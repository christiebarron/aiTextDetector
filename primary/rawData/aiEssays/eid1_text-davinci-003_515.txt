Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. In the current world, technology is quickly advancing and the massive use of computers is drastically altering the way people interact. I strongly believe that computers are having an overwhelmingly net positive effect on people. To support this claim, it is important to consider how computers enhance communication, productivity and creativity.

Firstly, computers provide an efficient way for people to communicate and collaborate. With the emergence of the Internet, we are able to connect with anyone around the world in just a few clicks. Whether it is sharing a news article, catching up with an old colleague or even doing a virtual job interview, the options are endless. Consequently, tasks that once took hours can now be completed in mere minutes.

Secondly, computers have drastically improved productivity. With certain advancements such as ultra-light laptops and faster Wi-Fi internet, we can now easily access the vast range of information available online at lightning speed. This not only enables us to save resources and money, but it also affords us the luxury of quickly completing tasks with minimal effort.

Lastly, computers have allowed us to express our creativity and technical skills in new and innovative ways. We can now produce complex documents, create fantastic artworks and even develop powerful software applications with the help of these fascinating machines.

In conclusion, I believe computers are helping to redefine our lives and fuel our passion for success. With
