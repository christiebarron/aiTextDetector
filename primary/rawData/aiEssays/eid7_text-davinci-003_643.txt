I remember last year when my little brother was doing his homework. He was struggling so much to finish it on his own but I could see the frustration mounting. I could tell he was starting to get angry but I stayed patient and tried my best to help him out. I sat with him, helping him understand the concepts, guiding him step by step. He wasn't getting it right away so I had to be really patient. I could tell he was really thankful for my help and I was glad that I could stay calm and understanding in the moment. We finally finished his homework and I could see the relief and gratitude on his face. That feeling of satisfaction was priceless and I'm glad I was able to stay patient with him throughout his struggle.
