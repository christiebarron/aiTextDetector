Recently there has been a rise in discussions about censorship in libraries. It is a highly controversial topic, as libraries are havens for open minds and free information. But should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? 

Many proponents of censorship are of the opinion that libraries should protect those who are vulnerable from offensive materials, such as those targeted toward specific groups or containing explicit language or images. These claims indicate that such material could be seen as promoting hatred and prejudice, and that its removal is important to maintaining a safe atmosphere in libraries. 

However, the importance of balancing censorship with freedom of speech and inquiry is of vital importance. Libraries should be places that provide access to information so that people can make up their own minds about an issue and come to a thoughtful conclusion. 

Furthermore, freedom of expression and freedom of speech are fundamental pillars of any healthy democracy. If libraries were to censor books and even censor discussion of those books, we would be moving away from our democratic roots and would be on a slippery slope towards authoritarianism.

Finally, it is important to consider who should be making the decision as to which materials should be censored. Libraries should be allowed to make their own decisions. It is essential that this process is done in a thoughtful and transparent way which is accountable to the public, ensuring recourse for any decisions that may have been made in haste or without appropriate justification. 

Censorship in libraries is a complex issue with multiple considerations, but there should still be a balance between protecting those from hateful material, and promoting free speech, inquiry, and expression within our libraries
