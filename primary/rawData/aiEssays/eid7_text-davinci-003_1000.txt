I remember the time I was stuck in the worst traffic jam of my life while driving home from work. I had been driving less than a mile every 10 minutes for nearly an hour. People around me started to get frustrated and angry, blaring their horns to try to move the line faster.

I had to consciously remind myself to stay calm and patient. I took deep breaths, distracted myself with music, and tried to remind myself that this was beyond my control. I also knew honking at other drivers wasn't going to make the traffic jam go away. 

Eventually, after nearly two hours, the traffic started to move and I was able to get home. I felt really proud of myself for my ability to remain patient even in a stressful situation. It felt like a valuable life lesson and victory.
