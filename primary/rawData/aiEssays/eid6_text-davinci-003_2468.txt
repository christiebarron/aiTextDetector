The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building was a grand ambition when the tallest building in the world was being designed in the 1930s. Constructed during the golden age of airships and human flight, dreams of airships traveling in and out of the Empire State Building ran high. However, the realization of this dream was met with numerous obstacles.

The Empire State Building was originally designed with two platforms on the 102nd floor, designed precisely to the specifications of a mooring mast for airships. However, the airship industry soon took a turn for the worst due to the development of the airplane, limiting the practical applications of airships. Furthermore, numerous technological challenges posed a formidable obstacle to making the Empire State Building amenable to dirigible docking.

The mooring mast atop the Empire State Building had to be able to withstand harsh weather, including both high winds and lightning, which was potentially fatal to an airship. Additionally, it had to be able to accommodate a wide variety of sizes and loads, as both large and small airships had to be able to dock. Sway and vibration dampers had to be installed, in order to prevent the mast from swaying in the wind and disrupting the airships. It also had to be stable enough to be able to withstand the weight of airships pulling on the cables. Additionally, a powerful engine was needed to lift the airships onto the mooring mast.

The many technological challenges led to considerable financial costs, which discouraged numerous potential uses of the Empire State Building's mooring mast for dirigibles
