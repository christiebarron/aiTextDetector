I will never forget the day when my best friend and I first laughed together. We had just started getting to know each other and both of us were feeling a little awkward. We had been talking for a few minutes trying to make small talk, but neither of us could find a way to break the tension. That is, until I said something ridiculous that I can't even remember now, and we both started laughing at the same time. 

It was like the ice had been broken and we were able to finally relax and feel at ease. We continued to talk for the rest of the night, laughing more and more each time. By the end of the night I felt like I knew my best friend on a deeper level as if we had been close for many years. 

Laughter brought us together that day, and it's something we still share to this day. We don't even need a reason to laugh now; we just look at each other and start laughing. Our laughter has become an instant connection that can never be broken.
