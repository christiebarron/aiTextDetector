I remember the day I met my best friend like it was yesterday. We were both in the same grade, and we had been in the same classes since preschool. I'd seen him around, but I had never really talked to him. So when the lunch bell rang and my friends and I gathered in the school parking lot, I was surprised and a little bit nervous when he came walking over to our group.

I expected brief introductions and handshakes, and then everyone would go their separate ways. But as soon as he got close to our group, he started making silly jokes and funny faces that had us all laughing our heads off.

He made silly faces at me and even tried to mimic me, which only made me laugh harder. It was like he'd known us all his life, and he completely fit into our group. 

He proved to be the life of the party, getting us all involved in games, like tag, and having fake races to the park with funny propositions. He always made us laugh, no matter the situation.

Ever since then, laughter has always been an integral part of our friendship. We could be talking about something serious, but then he'd say something funny and the mood would lighten up. It's been that way for years, and I'm so grateful for it. Laughter has kept us connected and made us even closer as friends.
