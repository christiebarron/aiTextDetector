The Empire State Building was an ambitious project and an iconic structure in New York City. The structure was, and continues to be, one of the most recognizable skyscrapers in the world. Among the stunning features of the building is the ability to dock dirigibles. However, this ambitious endeavor posed monumental engineering challenges. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted recounts in her article “The Mooring Mast,” creating the mooring mast and tower – that allowed dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building – was a complex undertaking.

The construction of the mooring mast and tower was an unprecedented feat of engineering. The building itself stands on shaky, unstable ground and posed significant challenges for the builders, as it rocked slightly and settled into the ground during the installation process. The mooring tower was shaped like a “gigantic Hershey-Kiss” and stood on the very top of the Empire State Building, rising nearly 80 stories. This structure needed to be built to withstood gust of up to 150 mph — powerful winds that often rip through the city. In order to accommodate the docking of dirigibles, the tower had to be made of the strongest materials available at the time, such as steel and concrete.

In addition to the engineering challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building faced considerable public scrutiny during the construction of the mooring mast and tower. Many people questioned the reasons and feasibility of the project, thinking it was too costly, dangerous, and impractical. There were safety concerns from possible aircraft collisions, and there were doubts as to whether dir
