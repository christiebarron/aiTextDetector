Minfong Ho’s short story “Winter Hibiscus” effectively illustrates the interconnectedness between life and death. The main character is a young girl named Mei Fei who has recently failed a Chinese language test. She finds solace from her unease by looking out of her window at a hibiscus tree, as if the connection between her life and the tree’s winter state reflects her own feeling. By ending her story with “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” Ho is emphasizing the cyclical nature of life, and how hope can be found in the thought of a new beginning. 

The winter hibiscus symbolizes Mei Fei’s connection with life and death, conveying her own feeling of uncertainty, unchangingness, and hope. Despite the cold and barren season, there is a promise of new life and a renewal of hope in spring. The final line of the story is especially meaningful as it references not only the rebirth of the hibiscus, but Mei Fei’s own opportunities for growth and redemption. As time passes, she can have the comfort of knowing that a new season is on the horizon and that she can take the test again, to try and improve her circumstances.

Ho’s story is an example of how we can find new perspectives through challenging times, emphasizing the importance of resilience and hope. As the forces of nature remind us of the cycle of life, so
