I will never forget the moment I shared a laugh with my grandmother. It was a beautiful, sunny afternoon and we had just finished making cookies together. As we were gathering our things, I stumbled a bit and almost dropped the bowl of cookie dough. My grandmother immediately broke into laughter, and I soon followed. We ended up laughing for what felt like an eternity, and it was one of the most beautiful moments I can remember. 

The laugh cleared the air and melted away any tension between us. It felt like that laugh connected us in a new and profound way. I felt so close to her in that moment, closer than we had ever been before. 

After we finished, we shared a smile and a hug. It felt like that hug lasted forever and I was overwhelmed with feelings of warmth and happiness. That day I learned that laughter truly is the best medicine, and can bring people together in the most special of ways.
