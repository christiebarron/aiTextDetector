Sometimes I forget that laughter really is the best medicine. Recently, my husband and I had been going through a tough spot in our relationship. We had been arguing and had hit a rough patch. 

One night, my husband decided to take me out on a date to try to say sorry. At the restaurant, we started making awkward small talk and it was obvious that we were both still uneasy about the situation. 

Change of mood came when a fly starting buzzing around us and landed on our table. We both instinctively started to swat at it and before we knew it, we were jokingly trying to compete over who could kill it quicker. 

It was in that moment that I started to laugh uncontrollably. My husband joined in and soon enough, it was a competition of laughter. 

We shared a tender look and, in that moment, it felt like our issues were forgotten and we were finally able to put things behind us. It was in that moment when we both realized the healing power that can come with laughter. 

Laughter is truly the shortest distance between two people. And that moment in the restaurant was a gentle reminder that no matter what all couples go through, we can always come back together in laughter.
