Nowadays, libraries are beginning to censor certain books, music, movies, and magazines to protect people from potentially offensive topics. This action seems extreme and unnecessary, and does not align with the values of libraries being a place for education and knowledge for all. 

It would be irresponsible for libraries to remove such materials from the shelves without giving consideration to the informative and educational value such items may possess, regardless of content. Libraries should consider carefully the effect of censorship on the reputation of their institution and the trust of their patrons. Instead of depriving their readers of important and influential material, libraries should instead animate them with more information and understanding of subjects. 

We live in a world where access to intriguing ideas can open up a world of new opportunities to learn and grow, experiences and exposure. Though some people may find certain material offensive, that doesn’t mean that everyone should be censored from it by policy. People should be free to search out information on their own and form their own opinions regarding any subject. Every individual has a right to their own opinion and to seek out more information on any topic. 

Moreover, libraries should consider the special balance needed to be struck between what is considered ‘controversial’ and what is ‘school- or family-appropriate.’ Libraries should not shy away from materials that can enlighten and teach and help children become thoughtful, informed and self-sufficient adults. There are opportunities to introduce important topics in an appropriate and age-appropriate manner.
