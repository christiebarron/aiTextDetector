The building of the Empire State Building was a momentous event in America's history, providing a symbol of industry and progress that remains iconic to this day. But a lesser known element of the construction project was the effort to make space for dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. Despite being a pioneering initiative, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face significant obstacles while trying to incorporate this feature.

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome was procuring a viable docking system. "The Mooring Mast," written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, states that the creators of the building initially wanted to use a large balloon or “cradle” at the top of the mast, which would convince an airship captain to put down their craft. However, the weight of the mast and the airships combined would have weighed too much, requiring more engineering effort that the project was initially willing to invest. Eventually a steel mast with steel cables, termed "Mooring Mast II", was created that could handle the weight of the craft, allowing for the successful installation of the docking feature.

The builders of the Empire State Building also encountered technical difficulties in finding a way to power the mast to winch an airship up to the rooftop. "The Mooring Mast" describes how the architects initially envisioned an elaborate system of counterweights and cables operated by a large electric motor that could be used to pull airships up as they landed on the mast. However, this system was deemed too heavy, expensive, and noisy and was never implemented. Instead, a p
