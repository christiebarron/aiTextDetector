My friend and I were taking a walk on a gorgeous summer day. We had a few hours of freedom and wanted to make the most of it.

We decided to take the path along the lake. We'd covered the first few miles of the hike in good time, when suddenly my friend started to laugh hysterically. I was a little taken aback at first, but I couldn't help but smile - watching him laugh was infectious.

When he finally calmed down, I asked him what he found so hilarious.

He pointed to the lake, where a group of ducks were quacking and chasing each other about. Apparently, each duck was trying to grab a piece of bread from the lake and it ended up in a hilarious chase that he couldn't help but find amusing.

We both burst into laughter, the scene playing out in front of us too funny to not let out a few chuckles. The moment was such a wonderful reprieve from the stresses of everyday life.

We continued our hike, chuckling here and there whenever we remembered the silly ducks. It was a great reminder that sometimes taking a moment to laugh is just as important as anything else.
