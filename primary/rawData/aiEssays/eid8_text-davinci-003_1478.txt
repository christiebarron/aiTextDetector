I’ll never forget the first time I met my husband. I had been talking to him for a few weeks online and was excited to finally meet him in person. When we met for dinner, I noticed he was carrying a small book with him, and he asked if I wanted to read a passage with him. I agreed, assuming it was some kind of joke he had planned.

As I watched him unfolding the pages, I could hardly contain my laughter. He had brought a book of jokes! We spent the rest of the dinner telling each other our favorite jokes and even daring each other to try some of the sillier ones from the book. There was something so comforting about having this intimate, shared moment of laughter.

That night at dinner set the tone for our relationship. We’ve been married for four years now, and having the ability to share stories, jokes, and laughter definitely keeps our relationship fresh and fun. It’s funny to think that what seemed like such a silly moment that night was actually an indication of our strong bond and something that still brings us together to this day.
