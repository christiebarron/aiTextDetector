I remember the first time I had a full belly laugh with my wife. We had been married for a few years already, but it was that moment when time seemed to freeze in the room - neither of us could get out of laughing once we started.

It had been a long and difficult day at work, and I was exhausted when I got home. We had been going through a tough patch in our relationship, and so we decided to take a walk and talk it out. I was sure that we would just end up arguing again, but instead something different happened.

We decided to take a detour through the park, and while walking along the path, we spotted a squirrel scampering away with an old newspaper. His tail was puffed out and he was obviously enjoying the feel of his newfound prize. We couldn't help but just start roaring in laughter, gasping for air from how funny it was.

The intensity of our laughter ended up pushing us closer together, and all the worries and problems of the day were forgotten for a few moments. We realized that laughter could be the bridge that brought us closer in a way that nothing else could. From then on, laughter became an even bigger part of our lives, and we still share a good laugh whenever we need to relax and get back on the same page.
