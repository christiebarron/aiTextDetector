I was driving on a very busy highway one day when I noticed that the traffic was starting to move faster. I took a glance at the speedometer and realized that I was going almost ten miles over the speed limit. I was about to reduce my speed when I noticed a police car in the distance. 

I had two choices, I could either reduce my speed and get pulled over, or keep going and hope for the best. I decided to take a more patient approach, and to keep going at the same speed. As I drew closer to the police car, I held my breath and silently prayed that I wouldn't get pulled over. 

As I drove past the police car, I let out a big sigh of relief. I had passed the test, and managed to remain patient and not get pulled over. The sense of accomplishment and pride I felt in that moment was incredible and showed me that patience really is a virtue.
