I can still remember it like it was yesterday. I was on a date with my partner at the time, and we had been walking around in town for what felt like forever. We were both beginning to feel a bit tired and discouraged, but when our eyes met, we both burst out laughing. 

We couldn't believe how long we had been walking around and how silly it was that we were so tired. We laughed until tears were streaming down our faces. Afterward, we felt energized, and it was like the whole evening changed. Everything felt brighter and lighter.

We decided to grab some ice cream and stopped at the nearest place, then continued walking until we eventually came across a small park and some benches. We sat down to finish our ice cream and talked over the events of the day. 

The conversation was full of humor and laughter, and we just couldn't stop laughing. We felt connected and in sync, like we could tackle anything. Looking back, I know that none of this would have been possible without laughter. It truly is the shortest distance between two people.
