In 1930, the completion of the iconic Empire State Building thrust New York City into the modern era. While the city marveled at this architectural achievement, its visionary builders had a radical goal—to make the Empire State Building the first high-rise in the world capable of docking dirigibles. Although it was a huge undertaking, the concept was not as far-fetched as it seems. In “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lüsted shares the story of the difficult challenges the builders faced in making this ambitious dream a reality.

The Empire State Building was constructed with its upper floors wide enough for the airships to land. This presented one of the first major obstacles: the wind. Winds buffeting the building at such a height were strong enough to push the airships off course, and when they were approaching the dock they might be 20 degrees off center. The solution was complicated and expensive; extensive mooring wires were installed along the side of the building, designed to help the airships ride the wind while they maneuvered into place. If a gust of wind was too strong, the wires allowed the dirigibles to stay in place as they approached the dock.

Then there was the matter of actually landing on the building. This presented another challenge. To moor the airship, a mast had to be erected near the top of the Empire State Building. This mast, or “mooring mast,” was so tall that its base was located 200 feet below the main platform of the building. This meant that in order to dock the dirigibles,
