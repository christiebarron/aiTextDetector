I remember the laugh that brought me and my dad together. I was a grumpy teenager, and we had been having an argument all morning. We were sitting in the kitchen, neither of us saying anything, when I accidentally dropped the entire carton of orange juice on the floor—it was like a slow motion disaster. But then the weirdest thing happened; we both started laughing. 

At first, it was just a little chuckle, tentatively emerging from the tension of our argument. But soon enough, loose laughter cascaded out of us, and we were howling with laughter. The room was filled with joy. There was something special about this moment, something that reminded me that despite our differences, my dad and I still shared the same sense of humor. We laughed until our stomachs hurt and the tension was gone. 

From that day onward, we both sought out ways to bring more laughter into our relationship. When we spent time together, we went out of our way to make each other laugh. Sure, we still had our disagreements, but learning to laugh took the edge off and made us closer. 

So, while I can’t always avoid a disagreement, I can always take a moment and remember that laughter is the quickest way to bridge those gaps.
