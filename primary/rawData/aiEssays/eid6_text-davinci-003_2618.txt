The Empire State Building is a remarkable example of a structure that includes features to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. However, builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles that hindered their ability to allow dirigibles to dock successfully and safely.

The first obstacle was finding a location to house the mooring masts or masts that dirigibles could dock on. Although the 315 ft. height of the building made it an ideal location to place the mooring masts, the traditional docking area was too small. The Empire State Building builders had to find another suitable spot away from the structure to place them. By scaling the masts down to just 80 feet, the builders were able to create a larger area away from the structure for the mooring masts.

The second obstacle was developing a secure system for dirigibles to dock on the mooring masts. As Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted wrote in her article, "The Mooring Mast," the builders of the Empire State Building had to create an elaborate system of pulleys and counterweights using the weight of the dirigible to safely pull and secure it onto the mooring mast. With the light weight of the dirigibles and the lightweight makeup of the mooring masts, the builders had to test several materials and designs to ensure the combined strength of both the dirigibles and the mooring mast allowed the system to wrap and bind the dirigible safely in place.

The third obstacle was developing a platform or ramp that dirigibles could use to disembark passengers safely into the building. This
