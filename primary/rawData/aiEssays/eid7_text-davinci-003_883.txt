I had recently started my new job as a receptionist and I was feeling overwhelmed. There were a lot of people coming through everyday and I wasn't sure I was going to be able to handle it all. One particular day a man came into the office with a lot of documents and paperwork that he needed help with. He was clearly stressed and frustrated and was not being particularly kind to me. I took a deep breath and remained patient and understanding. I asked questions in order to better understand the situation and slowly figured out how to help him. He ended up leaving the office happier than when he arrived, and thanked me for my help. I was relieved that I had stayed patient and kind throughout the interaction, and that I had been able to help the man.
