I'll never forget the moment I first met my best friend. I was having a really bad day—I had been waiting for news of a promotion that I didn't get, feeling like I'd hit a brick wall. As I was walking down the street and lamenting to myself, I passed a restaurant full of people having lunch and caught a glimpse of my best friend. She was laughing at something her friend had just said, and the sound of her laugh was so genuine and infectious that before I even knew what I was doing, I was smiling, too.

Without meaning to, I walked into the restaurant, and when my friend saw me, she waved and gestured for me to join them. I sat down and started to join in on their conversation, but as I opened my mouth, she placed her hand on mine to stop me. She told me her friend had just said something hilarious, and with a smile, said “Before we hear your story, let’s hear your laugh! Go ahead, laugh with us!”

It felt like the warmth of her smile was radiating through her hand, and so I couldn't help myself and broke out into a full-bellied laugh. I think that was the moment when I realized that I had found my best friend. From then on, laughter has been a foundation of our friendship—whenever one of us is feeling down, the other will know just the right thing to say to get our spirits lifted, often to the accompaniment of laughter. Without laughter, our friendship wouldn’t be nearly as strong as it
