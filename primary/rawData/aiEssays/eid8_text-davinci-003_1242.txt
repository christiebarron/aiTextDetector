I was out with a group of friends one night at a bar, enjoying drinks and conversation. Suddenly we heard loud laughter coming from the kitchen. We all stopped to see who could possibly be having that much fun while working in the kitchen. 

To our surprise, we saw a chef and a waitress on the floor in the middle of the kitchen, both laughing hysterically. It was obvious that this wasn't their regular behavior, and when they noticed us standing there, they quickly stopped and stood up. The chef apologized and explained that they had been trading jokes, trying to make each other laugh. The waitress looked embarrassed that she had been caught in the middle of it.

We all laughed, even the manager, and went back to our conversation. That moment really stood out for me, for two reasons. First, I saw how well the two of them got along and how powerful a little laughter can be. And second, it reminded me that even in the middle of a busy kitchen, it's important to laugh and to make time for other relationships.
