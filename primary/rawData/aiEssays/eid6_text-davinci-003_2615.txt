The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in making it possible for dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure. One of the most significant obstacles involved both the building's design and the dirigibles of the time.

The Empire State Building was designed to have an observation area with an open deck on the observation level of the 86th floor. This open deck was trimmed and sloped for aerodynamic purposes and the architects had plans to install a mooring mast to allow dirigibles to dock. However, the several types of airship designs in the 1920s demanded a modest amount of height so that they could be safely moored. This contrasted with the very low height of the Empire State Buildingâ€™s open deck, leaving the builders without room to install the mooring mast they had originally planned on.

At the same time, the Empire State Building's height posed a significant challenge, even if the mooring mast could be installed. The problem was based off the fact that airships of the era were limited by their technology. The airships of the 1920s could not safely dock at a height higher than 1500 feet. That left the builders with a dilemma, as the Empire State Building was already far too tall to be safely moored.

In the end, the builders settled on a reduced height of 1,250 feet. This repositioning of the airship mooring mast resulted in the structure being located at the top of the building, rather than on the deck, which allowed the airships of the time to dock safely. The installers of
