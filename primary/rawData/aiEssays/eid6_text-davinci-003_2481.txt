The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City, completed in 1931, was an ambitious architectural undertaking. At the same time, engineers hoped to use the building’s roof as a site for mooring dirigibles, a type of large, lighter-than-air craft that was popular in the era. Dirigible passengers would arrive in style, docking directly atop the Empire State Building instead of landing at a regular airport. However, due to numerous obstacles, this plan ultimately proved impractical and the dirigibles instead landed elsewhere.

The chief challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was safety. Issues surrounding loading and unloading passengers, securing the mooring mast on the building’s roof, and providing a suitable landing area were all considered in the planning process. Engineers also worried about the instability of the dirigibles themselves, and the potential wind hazards due to the tall building. That is why, in the end, the Empire State Building was not equipped with a mooring mast.

Furthermore, another major obstacle was the simple cost of building and maintaining the mooring mast. Home to more than a dozen radio masts, the roof of the Empire State Building was already crowded. Engineers also needed to ensure that the mast was strong enough to support the weight of a fully-loaded dirigible, with its passengers and freight, and that it could withstand New York’s frequent high winds. The estimated cost of the mooring mast eventually proved too high, and the dirigible docking plan was abandoned.
