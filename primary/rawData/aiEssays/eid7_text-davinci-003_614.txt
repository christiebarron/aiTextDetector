One time I was at work, and things were getting very busy. I was trying to do my own job, and all of a sudden the manager came to me with a last minute task. I was already under a lot of pressure and I was getting frustrated, however I thought to myself that now is not the time to loose my temper. I took a deep breath and calmly responded to him. I told him I was already doing a lot of work and that I would try to fit his task in, but it may take some time. He was understanding, and I was relieved that instead of getting angry, I stayed patient and collected. This experience reminded me to stay patient and understanding even under pressure.
