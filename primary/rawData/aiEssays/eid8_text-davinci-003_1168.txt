When I was in university, my friend and I had a running joke that we were actually twins. We just had this strange yet unspoken bond that included our own strange sense of humor.

One day, while studying at the library, we came across a particularly complicated section of a textbook that neither of us could understand. After trying and failing to make sense of it, we both just started laughing. Not because it was funny, but because we had just realized that we both found the same problem baffling and there was nothing we could do.

That moment of laughter made us feel closer and reassured us that no matter how different our lives became, we would always have each otherâ€™s back.
