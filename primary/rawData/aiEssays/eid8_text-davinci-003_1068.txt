When I met my husband, we had an immediate connection. One of the things we both enjoyed and connected over was our ability to laugh together. We would be in the middle of an earnest and serious conversation, only to burst out laughing together. We found each other's stories amusing, and we could bond over our own memories of our hilarious past experiences.

Whenever we were together, our conversations were just as full of laughter as they were of thoughtful conversations. We found comfort and solace in the sound of each other's laugh. Even though we hadn't known each other for very long at that point, we felt like we had been friends for years, and it was all thanks to our ability to laugh together.

As time went on and we had been together for years, our laughter has stayed and grown with us. We have experienced both very serious and challenging times, as well as joyous and funny ones. Through it all our laughter has been a common thread that binds us together and gives us the strength to face whatever comes our way.

Every day, I find joy in the simple fact that after all this time, I still make my husband laugh. Even after all these years, there's nothing quite like that sound of shared laughter in our relationship.
