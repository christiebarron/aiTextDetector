The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' have a great impact on the cyclist. The story takes place on a familiar winding mountain road, heavily weathered with potholes, and patches of shifting gravel. The rough terrain of the road makes the cyclist's journey difficult and slow-going. Every time the cyclist passes over a patch of gravel or a pothole, their tires lose traction, making it harder for them to stay on the bicycle. In addition, the gradient of the road is ever changing, at one moment rising and then plummeting in the next. This is especially apparent when the cyclist passes over the steep, rocky hills. The cyclist often has to step off their bike and walk it up the hill, as the road is not suitable for riding.

The road is also very narrow and winding, meaning that the cyclist has to constantly be aware of their surroundings to ensure that they don't swerve into traffic or off the road. The presence of the other cars makes it harder for the cyclist to find their way, as these cars often overtake them at speed, leaving them in a shower of gravel and dust. This can be disorientating and requires quick decision making
