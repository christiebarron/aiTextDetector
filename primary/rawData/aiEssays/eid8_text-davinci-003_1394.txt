I remember the first time I met my now-best friend. We were both at a work event, and we connected almost immediately. Conversation flowed easily, and we kept laughing at each other's jokes, until finally it all became overwhelming.

We looked around and realized that everyone had stopped what they were doing to watch us. We both immediately burst out in laughter, and everyone joined in. We were so relieved and felt like we had just two escaped two embarrassing moments.

From that day onwards, laughter has been the shortest distance between us. We don't need to say anything to make the other person laugh. We finish each other sentences and know exactly how the other will respond in any given situation.

Laughter has always been a great way for us to bond. When one of us is having a bad day and needs cheering up, the other doesn't need to think twice before cracking a joke. We understand that a good laugh every now and then is the best way to communicate and show affection.

Laughter isn't just a way to diffuse tension, but it also helps to keep our bond strong. As cheesy as it sounds, it's true that laughter truly is one of life's greatest gifts.
