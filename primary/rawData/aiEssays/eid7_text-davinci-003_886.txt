I was recently in line at the bank, waiting to deposit my cheque. The line was very long, and it was taking forever. People around me were getting visibly frustrated and tapping their feet on the ground, huffing and puffing.

But then I remembered how my mom always taught me the importance of patience and I decided to remain calm and composed. Even though it was taking a while, I allowed people to cut in front of me if they had a more urgent matter at hand, which made the line move a bit faster.

I kept my cool and every now and then, I glanced around to see if anyone needed help. As the line crawled forward, I could already hear the bank teller’s voice in the background. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I was the last one standing in the line.

The bank teller saw me and said, “Thank you for your patience. I can see you’ve been very patient today.” I nodded my head and smiled. I was glad that I was able to remain patient despite the long wait. In the end, it was so rewarding to be acknowledged for my patience.
