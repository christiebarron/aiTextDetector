I remember one time my friend and I were out hiking in the mountains. We had been walking for several hours, and we were both feeling tired and a bit out of sorts. We were getting towards the end of the hike and neither of us were feeling that happy. Suddenly, my friend slipped on a patch of wet leaves and ended up sprawled on the ground, her legs in the air. Instead of feeling sorry for her, I couldn’t help but start laughing – and, of course, she started laughing too. We just couldn’t stop until tears were streaming down our faces.

It was such a simple moment, but that shared laughter brought us both such joy and connected us in a way that nothing else could have. It was the perfect antidote to all our weariness, and allowed us to finish the hike in a much better frame of mind. Even now, when I think back to that day, I can’t help but smile.
