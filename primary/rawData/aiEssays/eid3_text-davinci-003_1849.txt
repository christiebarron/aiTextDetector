The curvature of the roads and its alpine-like ascents provide physical hardship and danger to the rider, as well as potential reward in conquering such considerable terrain.

The cyclist is exposed to the extreme temperatures of the alpine climate, experiencing heat and cold in both of their ends of the day. With the high temperatures, there are dangers of dehydration and extreme fatigue due to the reduced oxygen levels.
