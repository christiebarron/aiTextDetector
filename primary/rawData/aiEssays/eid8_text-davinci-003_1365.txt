I remember the laughter like it was yesterday. It was a summer day, and my father and I were out fishing in the lake near our house. We were sitting in the boat, trying our best to catch some fish, but matters were not going our way. With every cast of the rod, nothing. 

At one point, my dad and I had grown frustrated. We had been sitting in the same spot for what felt like hours and still no fish. In a fit of exasperation, my dad decided to throw his fishing rod into the lake. He wobbled as he stood up and took some unsteady steps, but stumbled and ended up in the lake. 

Surprised and with no time to react, I hollered out in shock. I thought my dad might be angry at himself, but before I knew it his face was creased with a huge laughter. My dad's laughter was contagious and soon I was laughing too. 

We both laughed until our sides hurt, no longer worrying about catching any fish that day. That moment together strengthened our relationship and I still remember the sound of my dad's laughter, even all these years later.
