I remember back when I was in college, I had a really close friend who I could always rely on. We were both huge comedy fans, so we spent a lot of time talking about the latest comedy films, jokes and anything else related to laughter.

One night, after a long day of studying, we decided to go out for dinner and a movie. We had a great time and just a few hours into our date, we had both been laughing non-stop. It felt amazing to let go and just be ourselves, no expectations, no fears, just honest laughter.

As the credits rolled at the movie's end, we found ourselves still laughing and tearing up in the theater. I will never forget the looks we got from the other theater-goers; we must have seemed quite a sight! 

Being able to laugh with someone is such a powerful thing. To this day, I treasure that moment as it reminded me of just how invaluable laughter can be in any relationship.
