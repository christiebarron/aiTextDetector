The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 was an engineering masterpiece of its time, but it also posed some unique challenges. One of them was to create a safe and efficient place for dirigibles to dock. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles while attempting to develop a platform to accommodate these large airships.

First, the fragile surface of the dirigibles posed a significant risk to the Empire State Building which had already been designed and constructed when the request to dock dirigibles was made. Special attention had to be given to secure the structure of the building and develop a mooring mast that allowed the airships to dock safely. This was no small feat, as it required the installation of a complex network of cables and rigging apparatus to safely hold the airship in place. 

In addition, the builders of the Empire State Building had to consider the possibility of sudden and severe wind shifts when determining the height and type of fitting for the mooring mast. Adding extra height to the mast, for example, would have made docking safer for the heavier-than-air dirigibles but also posed a risk to the Empire State Building by increasing the potential for turbulence and wind shifts. To counter this, the mast was set at a mid-level, so that it was tall enough for the dirigibles to safely dock yet wouldnâ€™t attract too much wind.

Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building needed to consider the types of airships that would be docking at the building. This was a particularly daunting task, as many of the dirigibles
