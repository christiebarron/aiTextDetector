Libraries are public spaces dedicated to learning and knowledge, filled with a variety of materials that can be used for educational and recreational purposes. Given the diverse array of interests, however, there is bound to be disagreement on what is appropriate for each individual library. The question of whether or not libraries should practice certain forms of censorship is a contentious one. 

There are compelling arguments for libraries to consider in favor of censorship. Libraries often hold children's materials, which could contain inappropriate content that could be damaging if discovered by a young reader. In addition, library patrons may come across something they would find offensive and inappropriate. Removing an offending book, movie, or magazine from the shelves will help ensure that any library-goers can remain comfortable and not face potential trauma. 

At the same time, however, censorship can have a galvanizing effect on larger political debates. Some libraries have chosen to engage in censorship in order to avoid taking a side on divisive topics. This would mean that important works of literature, songs, and movies that deal with subjects like critical race theory, LGBTQIA rights, and animal protection are denied a platform at their library. In doing so, libraries that choose to censor select materials risk furthering systemic inequalities, as those issues are often not broached in mainstream discourse. 

Ultimately, library censorship should remain a choice for local administrators to make. Libraries should make decisions on an individual basis, with consideration to the age of their patrons, local values, and community needs. When removing books and media, librarians should do so only after consulting with patrons, community members, and other stakeholders.
