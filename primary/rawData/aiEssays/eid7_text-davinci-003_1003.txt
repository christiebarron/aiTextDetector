I remember a time when I was very patient. It was a few years ago when I was at church and a young girl had become disruptive and was making quite a bit of noise. She kept talking and interrupting others, and I could tell that the pastor was getting frustrated, so I stepped in to calm the situation. 

I knelt down and quietly spoke to her, telling her softly that everything was going to be okay. She looked into my eyes and eventually settled down, calming her behavior and allowing the sermon to continue. 

Even though I was a bit frustrated myself, I stayed patient and understanding. I was able to stay calm and remain composed in order to guide and comfort the girl. I truly believe that this moment was indicative of how I want to handle any situation: with compassion, kindness, and patience.
