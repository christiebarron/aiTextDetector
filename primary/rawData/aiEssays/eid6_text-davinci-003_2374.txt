The Empire State Building was a revolutionary construction in its heyday, offering many innovations that had never been seen before. One of the most daring was the idea of allowing dirigibles, or lighter-than-air ships, to dock at the very top of the building. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to make this idea a reality.

The most pressing concern was the immensity of the project. The building was already unprecedented in size, reaching 102 stories and 1,250 feet tall, and the idea of constructing a docking mast at its peak would require even more resources and materials. Furthermore, the mast would have to be strong enough to sustain significant stress as dirigibles approached and pulled away from it - a feat that seemed impossible with the state of technology in the early 1930s.

The nature of the dirigibles themselves also posed a major issue. Being lighter than air, the ships depend on the wind direction to control their movements, meaning that docking the ship was extremely difficult. To make matters worse, it was impossible to predict the severity of the winds at the top of the Empire State Building, adding further uncertainty to the docking process.

Finally, the height of the mooring mast also presented a challenge. Dirigibles were typically equipped with equipment to aid in their docking, but trying to find a way to attach these tools at a height of 1,250 feet was an extraordinary venture. To make matters worse, it was unclear whether there were any materials strong enough to be used to support the docking mast at such an extreme height.
