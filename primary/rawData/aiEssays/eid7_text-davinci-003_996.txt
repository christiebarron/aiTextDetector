I remember I was in an extremely crowded train station with hundreds of people pushing and shoving past me. Everyone seemed to be in a rush and I was very overwhelmed. Despite all the chaos, I remained patient and calm. I kept reminding myself to breathe and to take the journey one step at a time.

As I waited for my train, I noticed a small family trying to catch the same one. They looked a bit disoriented and confused by the crowd and I wanted to offer my help. I approached them and asked if there was anything I could do to help. They were relieved to have someone to show them the right way – and they gratefully accepted.

I spent the next few minutes patiently guiding them around the station, even though I was already running late. We managed to make it to the platform in the nick of time, and the family thanked me graciously.

In that moment, I was reminded to not take things too seriously, but to be patient, kind, and open to helping people in need. Being patient may not always yield an immediate reward, but it’s a lesson that teaches us to appreciate and savor the journey, no matter how tough it may be.
