To the Editor,

I am writing today to urge your readers to consider the effects that computers have had on our lives. As someone who understands the importance of technology in the modern world, I also believe that we need to be mindful of the detrimental impacts computers can have on people.

The widespread use of computers has enabled us to stay connected across vast distances, and it has drastically changed our daily lives for the better in many ways. They have made our lives easier, allowing us to work faster and to communicate more quickly. But, at the same time, computers can also be incredibly addictive. A recent survey conducted by an independent research firm discovered that at least a third of people spend more than half of their day in front of a screen, missing out on important personal and professional opportunities. Furthermore, excessive screen time has been linked to psychological issues such as anxiety and depression, even in teenagers and children.

We must recognize that, while computers have the potential to be greatly beneficial, they can also be detrimental to our physical and mental health. Therefore, I strongly urge your readers to consider the impacts of their own computer usage, so that they can continue to use computers with moderation and remain healthy in mind and body.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
