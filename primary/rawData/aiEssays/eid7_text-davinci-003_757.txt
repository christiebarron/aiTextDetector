I recently had the pleasure of meeting a woman named Ellen who works as a cashier at a local store. She is always patient with customers and eagerly serves whoever walks through her lane.

One day, I walked into the store after a long day of work and was clearly exhausted. I was having a hard time when it came to finding exactly what I was looking for, and I could feel my frustration growing. I apologized to her for taking up her time and for being so easily frustrated.

To my surprise, she replied with a smile, “It’s alright, don’t worry.Take your time and we’ll find what you’re looking for.” I was amazed by her calm, reassuring demeanour and despite being behind a counter, she seemed to understand just how I was feeling.

After I had checked out and left the store, I couldn’t help but admire Ellen’s patience. In a world full of people quick to judge, she had demonstrated a true sense of compassion and understanding.
