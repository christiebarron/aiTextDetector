Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a deeply personal and profound exploration of his memories and experience growing up as a Cuban American. Through his writing, Rodriguez successfully creates a vivid and distinct mood. He paints vivid pictures of the people, places, and emotions he encountered in his life that heavily influenced and shaped his identity.

Rodriguez conjures up a nostalgic, reflective atmosphere through his descriptive language. The imagery of his Brooklyn neighborhood, its "mosaic of cultures", and its cherry trees juxtaposed with the memories of his childhood home in Havana effectively captures the bittersweet nature of his immigrant experience. He further underlines this bittersweet feeling of alienation and isolation with his reflections on language: "dual languages, the rhythm and dissonance of their overlapping conversations— Spanish, English, Spanglish". This provides a poignant reminder of the impact of his dual cultural inheritance, and highlights the complexity of his emotions.

Rodriguez expresses how he internalized his parents’ homesickness and how this "pushed [him] forward...fueling [his] ambitions". Through his writing, he offers an intimate portrait of his struggles to reconcile with his past and to find his place in the world. His exploration of the importance of home and identity creates a simple yet heartrending narrative. 

Ultimately, Rodriguez effectively creates a personal, melancholic and reflective atmosphere within his memoir. His thoughtful musings, beautiful prose, and willingness to engage with difficult emotions
