I was visiting my grandfather a few months ago, and he was feeling especially crotchety that day. I could tell he was having some difficulty getting himself dressed, and I was growing increasingly frustrated. I was about to ask him if he wanted some help, when I suddenly remembered the words my mother had told me the day before: "Your grandfather is getting older, so you'll need to be more patient with him".

So instead of getting angry and losing my temper with him, I forced myself to stay calm and speak in a gentle tone. I decided to give him some space as my grandfather wasn't asking for help, and he clearly wanted to do things himself. I sat back and waited to make sure I didn't disturb his process.

Eventually my grandfather was able to get his outfit on, and although it took him some time, I was glad that I had stayed patient and understanding throughout the process. Not only did my grandfather feel more comfortable doing things his way, but my example of patience also gave me some much-needed self-satisfaction.
