The builders of the Empire State Building faced a great challenge when considering allowing dirigibles to dock at it in the early 20th century. According to Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's The Mooring Mast, the most prominent of these obstacles were related to the technical and structural requirements of docking and the safety concerns of the mooring mast.

The process of docking a dirigible was quite complex and required careful preparation. For example, the Empire State Building had a limited flat space large enough for the airship to be secured without protruding over the edge of the building. Furthermore, the mooring mast had to be built at a certain height and safe distance from the building itself. A mooring mast provided the airship a place for a cable or rope to be snapped into the secured gear onboard.

In addition to size and height restrictions, the mooring mast needed to be constructed of strong and sturdy materials that could withstand strong winds, storms, and potential fire hazards. Due to the sheer size of the Empire State Building and its location in Manhattan, the mooring mast had to be designed so it would not be a nuisance or hinder the view of the city skyline.

Finally, safety was of the utmost importance. In the late 1920s, dirigibles were plagued by accidents, fires and explosions which caused the death of many passengers. Because of this, the mooring mast had to be designed in a way that would reduce the danger to the structure of the building and the people inside it.

Overall, the Empire State Building builders faced a unique and significant challenge
