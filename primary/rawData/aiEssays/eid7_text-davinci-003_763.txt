I remember a time when I was walking down a street and saw an elderly woman struggling with her shopping bags. I wanted to help her, but I didn't want to seem intrusive so I decided to wait and see if she needed assistance. Sure enough, after a few moments, she paused and said in a kind voice, "Do you think you could help me carry these?"

I was happy to help and was extra careful to ensure that I was gentle and patient with her. I made sure to take my time moving through the crowded street and, when she was ready, I held the door for her at the store. 

People often joke about how slow elderly folk can be, but I was impressed at how patient the woman was with herself. She didn't get angry or frustrated but rather took her time and made sure she got where she needed to go safely. She thanked me for my help and I was thankful for the opportunity to be patient with her.
