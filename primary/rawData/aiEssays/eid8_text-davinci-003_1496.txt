I used to work in a pet store, and one summer day, I was helping a customer find the perfect bird for his daughter. He could not decide between two different types of parrots, so he asked the advice of his daughter who was with him. His daughter was about eight years old and had an infectious giggle.

The situation became comical when the customer asked his daughter a question about what kind of bird she preferred. The daughter's response was, "I don't know, let me ask my parrot!" 

We all burst into a fit of laughter, the customer included. Even the daughter, who was confused about why we were laughing, was laughing with us. The entire pet store was filled with joy and laughter that day. 

It was a moment that I will never forget because it made me realize how important it is to laugh with one another no matter the situation. After that, I would make sure to take time out of my day to have a good laugh with customers or fellow employees. It really can be the shortest distance between two people.
