The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ has a significant effect on the cyclist experiencing it. The environment of the scene is stark, barren and desolate, set against an unwelcoming desert. The hot, dry air exacerbates the cyclist’s sense of danger and unease as he battles through the rolling sand dunes. This serves to highlight the determination of the cyclist to finish his journey regardless of the unfavourable conditions.

The composition of the scene with its open, exposed and flat terrain symbolises the journeys of the cyclist. The emptiness of the panorama draws attention to the cyclists’ loneliness, a sense of insignificance in the face of the wilderness. The cyclone fence, the jagged mountains, the cacti and scrub, further emphasise the harshness of the environment, heightening the intensity of the man’s endeavours.

By travelling through an environment that is so hostile and seemingly unending, the cyclist is dealing with the challenge of continual resistance. The sand dunes, the sparse vegetation and the vast barrenness paint a gloomy picture of his prospects of escape. This aids in creating the sense of an uphill battle
