I remember the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the first days of my new job. I had just moved to a new city and was so excited to begin my new life.

My first day on the job, I was already feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the different faces and conversations that were occurring around me. The environment was lively, but in a strange way, I felt alone.

As I was starting to feel lost in my new job, I heard the sound of laughter come from the back of the room. As I turned to look, I saw two of my coworkers laughing, clearly enjoying each otherâ€™s company.

The laughter was contagious and I couldn't help but smile. I had never felt so connected to any place before and a warm feeling spread throughout my body.

I felt an instant connection to those two and was so grateful for the laughter. It was a reminder that no matter how overwhelming things may seem, there is always joy in the journey.

We shared plenty of laughs in the days to come, eventually forming a strong bond of trust, understanding and friendship. That moment of laughter still brings a smile to my face whenever I think about it.
