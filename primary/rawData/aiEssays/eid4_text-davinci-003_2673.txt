Minfong Ho’s poem “Winter Hibiscus” is a beautiful exploration into the passing of time, and the idea that nature is ever-changing while time stands still. The speaker in the poem is faced with the daunting task of taking a test, and finds solace in the blooming winter hibiscus in her garden. Rather than taking the test, she decides to take a moment to appreciate the natural beauty around her, and put the test on pause until spring arrives. 

By ending the poem with this line, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” Ho uses the life cycle of nature to stand in for the passing of time. Nature’s life cycle is irreversible, and the speaker in the poem is accepting that she can’t go back and change what has come before. Instead, she turns her focus to the beauty of the moment, and the beauty that awaits her in the future when the snows melt. 

This is a powerful message and serves as a reminder that we must savor the present and take a moment to appreciate what we have, for it will soon pass. Nature is always moving forward, and saying goodbye to the old as it welcomes the new. We must accept that all things come to an end, and use that as motivation to value the time we have and follow through on our goals. In this way, the speaker in Ho’s poem serves as an inspiration
