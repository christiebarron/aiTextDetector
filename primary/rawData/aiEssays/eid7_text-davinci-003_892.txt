I was on my way to visit my grandparents one summer when I got stuck in a terrible traffic jam. I hate being stuck in traffic, but I knew that it was not worth getting angry over. So instead of flying off the handle, I took a deep breath and stayed patient.

I used the time I was stuck in traffic to practice some breathing techniques - deep breaths in and out. I paid attention to my surroundings, making sure to appreciate the scenery of the countryside that I was passing through. I focused on the music playing in the car, a calming classical piece that I hadn't taken the time to listen to in a while.

By the time I arrived at my grandparents' house, I felt relaxed and at peace. I was so glad that I had decided to stay patient - it had helped to turn a stressful situation into an opportunity for relaxation and peace.
