It is an important public debate whether certain materials should be censored and removed from our public library shelves if deemed offensive. To censor or not to censor; that is the question. I understand and appreciate the interest of protecting vulnerable members of the public from being exposed to offensive content, however we should err on the side of caution when considering limiting access to potentially valuable sources of knowledge and information. 

Rather than completely censoring material from public library shelves it is more beneficial to provide support to parents and other members of the public regarding how to assist in addressing and engaging in conversations with their children and others, about the types of material they may encounter at the library and what is socially and morally appropriate. 

To control the flood of inappropriate content, we should rely on initiatives such as the establishment of effective ratings systems. Appropriate parental guidance and instruction should also be offered. This could give the ultimate control to parents and other members of the public to decide what is suitable content for their children, or others, to access. 

We must remember that public libraries are an important educational resource and at times can serve as a refuge away from home for people of all backgrounds, soci-economic levels, and ages. To categorically censor and remove material from library shelves violates our rights as citizens of The United States to freely access information within the boundaries of our laws. 

In sum, we must strive to support our communities in order to protect young minds from potentially inappropriate materials, while also ensuring that our public libraries remain an open and accessible information resource to all members of the public.
