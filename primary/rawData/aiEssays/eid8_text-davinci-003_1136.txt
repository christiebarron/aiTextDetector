 

My closest friend and I had been together since preschool. We were inseparable. It seemed like no matter what, she always made me laugh. It could have been anything; a funny movie, an embarrassing story, or just a silly joke. 

One day, we decided to make a list of all the silly things that we had done when we were growing up. We laughed uncontrollably as we went down the list. We went through old photos, funny pranks we had pulled off, and all of the crazy activities we had done.

We were laughing so loudly that my mom came in to check on us to make sure everything was okay. We both quickly caught our breath, not wanting to get in trouble. 

But when she looked at us, she started laughing too. She shared her own funny stories and embarrassing moments with us. Even though they were embarrassing stories to share, we laughed as though she was the funniest person we had ever heard. After that, we decided to make that our Friday night tradition and get together to reminisce and laugh. 

It's been almost 10 years since then, and laughter still continues to bring us together. It's something I always cherish and hold close to my heart. Nothing else compares to the feeling of being surrounded by good laughter with the people you love.
