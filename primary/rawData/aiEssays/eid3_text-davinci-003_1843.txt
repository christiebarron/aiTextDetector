The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski not only reflects the cyclist’s physical and emotional journey, but also affects it in a deeply personal way. When describing the cyclist, the narrator notes that he is “battered down,” “waking to a cold and lonely morning,” and “tired of his long, arduous and lonely journey.” In addition to depicting the cyclist’s weariness and loneliness, the setting also serves to highlight the strength of his determination and drive. The narrator describes how “the road brings a unique sense of challenge and adventure” and how the cyclist “persists forward” despite the difficulty of the terrain and the mental challenge of remaining focused and strong. 

The cyclist is also affected by the landscape, both physical and emotional. The author describes “mountains full of stories”, which serve to inspire and encourage the cyclist to continue on despite the tough, unpredictable terrain that lies ahead. In addition to inspiring him, the landscape also serves to remind him of the beauty, strength and power of life, which allows him to stay centered and focused on his journey.
