I was on a train on the way to visit my best friend, who was studying abroad, when I noticed the guy sitting across from me trying to fight back a laugh. I didn't know why, but before I could ask, I got a text from my friend saying she had just made a big mistake. Naturally, this made me laugh, though I tried to be polite and silent about it.

The guy across from me noticed and smiled. He asked, "What could possibly be so funny?" I explained the situation, and he smiled wider, and said, "Well, I suppose that's one way to welcome you home". We then talked and laughed about the mistakes my friend had made and my crazy personality.

It was then I realized that laughter really was the shortest distance between two people.

By the end of the train ride we were great friends, and to this day we still laugh about that experience whenever we get together.
