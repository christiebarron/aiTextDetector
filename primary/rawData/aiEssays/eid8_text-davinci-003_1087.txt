I was standing there, my mouth open in shock as I laughed uncontrollably. I couldn’t believe that my best friend had just said what she had said.

We were at the beach together, a place we had gone to hundreds of times before, and were walking along the shore. The sun had just sunk below the horizon, painting the sky in beautiful shades of pink and orange.

Suddenly, she stopped and looked up at the sky. With a mischievous grin, she said, “I bet I could jump higher than the moon!”

The challenge was so unexpected, so ridiculous, that I couldn’t help but erupt into laughter. I laughed until tears were streaming down my face, and I couldn’t contain my mirth.

My best friend joined in my laughter, and for that moment, we were lost in the joy, connected by the shortest distance between two people: laughter.
