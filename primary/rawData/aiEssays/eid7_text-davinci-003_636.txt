I was recently in line at the grocery store and it took forever. It seemed like forever even though it was probably only 10 minutes. I was getting a bit frustrated and I could feel my blood boiling. I had to remind myself to be patient. 

Finally, it was my turn to check out. I handed the cashier my items and apologized for keeping her waiting. She told me it was fine and thanked me for being patient. I felt a wave of relief wash over me as I finally was able to pay for my items. 

Patience is something I'm still working on, but I'm happy I was able to remain level-headed in this instance. It really made the whole situation much more pleasant.
