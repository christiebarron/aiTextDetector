The Empire State Building presented an innovative concept when it included an "Mooring Mast," or a docking system for airships. While this created a unique feature for the building and could potentially open up a wide array of new transportation options, the builders faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the mast. 

The first obstacle faced by the builders was the need to create a mast that could remain securely in place at the top of the building. People had flown close to the Empire State Building before, but it had never been attempted that one dock there. The builders knew they needed to create a metal arm that would be connected to a reinforced foundation on the top of the building, but many questions remained on how secure the mast should be. 

The Imperial Air Line was the first to make an attempt at docking a dirigible at the building. However, when the airship finally arrived the wind was too strong for the crew to make a safe landing. This highlighted another obstacle for the builders - the factors of weather. Since the building was located in a city, weather systems such as high winds and variable temperatures would be a factor when attempting to dock a dirigible. In addition, the airship operators needed to be aware of all other air traffic in the area. 

The next challenge for the builders was to rapidly assess the adjustments that needed to be made in order to allow for a successful docking. After some trial and error, a new mooring mast was designed with a 4-inch chain and a retractable anchor. This anchor, nicknamed the â€œatlantrop
