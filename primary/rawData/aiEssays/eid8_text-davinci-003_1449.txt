I can still remember the laughter that I shared with my best friend. It was during a summer afternoon at the beach when we were both 12. We had spent the day splashing around in the waves and building sand castles, and like usual, we had engaged in silly disputes and friendly competition for attention. 

The tensions between us suddenly melted away when we started to laugh. It started off as a giggle, but soon enough we were both shaking with laughter. As it started to echo through the beach, amusing the other people around us, we couldn't help but laugh even harder. With each burst of laughter, the sound of it seemed to bring us even closer.

That moment of shared laughter is something I still look back on fondly. There's something special and powerful about being able to laugh with someone else, especially when it's silly and unexpected. From that day on, our friendship began to deepen; we were no longer two people playfully competing, but two people connected by laughter.
