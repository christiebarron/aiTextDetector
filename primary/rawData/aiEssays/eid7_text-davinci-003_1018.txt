I had just started a new job and I was eager to make a good impression. Unfortunately, I encountered several problems that made the task of becoming acclimated much harder. For starters, my computer was outdated and the system was difficult to navigate. I was starting to get discouraged until I noticed that my manager was very patient with me.

Whenever I asked questions or took longer than expected to complete a task, my manager was always understanding and encouraging. Instead of getting angry or frustrated, they gave me the time and space necessary to learn the ropes. They were patient with my successes and failings, answering any questions I had and providing constructive feedback. 

With patience and time, I was eventually able to get the hang of things and become comfortable in my new role. Thanks to my manager's patience, I was able to embrace the challenge of learning something new and develop valuable skills in the process.
