Dear Editor:

In the modern world, computers have become increasingly integrated into our lives. From making our daily tasks easier to connecting us with people around the world, computers have revolutionized our way of life. The question I pose is this: are the effects of computers on people positive or negative?

There is no doubt that computers bring many advantages to our lives. By implementing computers, businesses can increase their efficiency, making products and services more available to consumers. Education has also been revolutionized by computers. For instance, students can now use computers in their coursework or to research topics of interest. On the other hand, computers also have a few drawbacks. Excessive computer usage can have a damaging effect on an individualâ€™s physical and social life. Sitting for prolonged periods of time can lead to physical health problems in addition to anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders.

No matter how useful computers can be, it is important to remember that they are no substitute for real life interaction. Therefore, while they are certainly useful, computers should not be abused. We should strive to establish a healthy balance in our lives by minimizing our computer usage and focusing more on experiencing the world around us.

Sincerely, [Name]
