The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski has a direct influence on the cyclist in the story. Through the dense forest and snow, the cyclist is resiliently continuing his journey. The forest provides significant obstacles such as visibility, cold temperatures, and the overgrowth of trees and shrubs, making it difficult for the cyclist to maneuver and complete his journey.

The dense forest is a major factor in the cyclist's difficulty. The roads have become unkempt, with overgrowths of trees, bushes, and other foliage blocking the cyclist's line of sight. This desolate setting further contributes to the cyclist's distress in the story as he must focus on the road and the obstacles it provides.

The cold temperatures of the weather conditions also pose a challenge for the cyclist. Without proper insulation or the chance for rest, the cyclist must constantly be on alert battling with the cold and snow. This makes the cyclist and his journey more difficult and increases the time required to reach his destination.

The thicket of trees combined with the freezing temperatures have put the cyclist in an uncomfortable situation. By providing these details, the author gains insight into the tough conditions the cyclist has to endure in his journey.
