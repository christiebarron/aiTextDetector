I was sitting in a crowded bus and an elderly couple was also in there with me. The man and woman were giggling to themselves and seemed to be sharing a joke. Every time they shared a joke, they’d laugh heartily.

I was feeling down in the dumps and the couple’s laughter was infectious. I couldn’t help but smile at their adorable banter and eventually, I let out a small chuckle. The elderly woman noticed and her face broke into a wide smile. She got up from her seat and made her way to me.

“It’s been so long since I’ve heard someone laugh besides us two!” She said joyfully. The woman then proceeded to tell me numerous jokes that she and her husband had shared between themselves. 

Before I knew it, I was doubled over in fits of laughter. The other passengers on the bus were all smiling and laughing along with us. It felt like the entire bus was filled with joy. 

When the bus reached my stop, the elderly couple thanked me for bringing laughter back into their lives. That moment, I realized that laughter is truly the shortest distance between two people.
