The setting of Joe Kurmaski's poem “Rough Road Ahead” has a major impact on the cyclist. From the very beginning, the narrator describes a rough terrain with many dangers. It is clear that the cyclist is somewhat aware of the danger he may encounter but chooses to take on the challenge. 

The poem describes a humid air that quickly turns into a heavy downpour of rain, adding to the pressure of the cyclist's journey. The cyclist is now burdened with rain that he is already tired from pushing himself on the terrain. He can feel the mud sticking to his tires, making it even harder to keep forging ahead.

The narrator then describes the sharp curves in the path, which along with the mud, can make it difficult for the cyclist to continue. He is likely to find himself in dangerous terrain, using all of his strength to make it to the end.

The final line of the poem is a warning to the cyclist to be prepared for the unknown on his journey. He is warned that he may find himself in trying times and must be ready to face whatever problems stand in his way.
