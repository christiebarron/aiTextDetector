The Empire State Building was a major technological advance when it was completed in 1931, but even more remarkable was that the building was designed to serve as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This ambitious goal was no small feat and was met with numerous obstacles to overcome. 

The first challenge was to construct a building that was tall and sturdy enough to withstand the stresses of docking. The Empire State Building was built with an infrastructure of strong steel girders and concrete pillars, and its mooring mast was made of cobalt steel, specially designed to be both lightweight and durable. However, engineering around the mast had to be carefully calculated to ensure it could hold the tremendous weight of a dirigible, which was many times greater than a standard aircraft.

The engineers had to also factor in the weather. A mooring mast would be useless in a gale-force storm, so the Empire State Building was designed with special vents and resistance to strong winds. Additionally, the mooring mast was designed to retract into the building so it would not be accidentally pulled out by gradual shifts in wind direction.

Security was another factor to consider. Access to the buildings roof had to be restricted, and special landing platforms had to be constructed to keep the immense dirigible wings away from the building’s sides. Additionally, access to the mooring mast was only allowed for certain skilled pilots.

Finally, the building’s engineers had to come up with a plan for the mooring itself. The mooring mast had to be long enough to extend to the dirigible
