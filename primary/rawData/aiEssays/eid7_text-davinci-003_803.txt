I recently saw an example of patience when I was waiting in line at the grocery store. It was a busy Saturday morning, and I could already tell that it was going to be a long wait. The store was packed full of people, and the line seemed never ending. 

The customer in front of me was an older lady who was having trouble opening her wallet. She was struggling to get it out, fumbling around with her hands, but it wouldn’t open. The cashier patiently waited, not once making a comment or a judgmental look. After what seemed like forever, she finally got her wallet open and was able to take out her money.

The older lady thanked the cashier warmly for being so patient with her. The cashier smiled and said, “No problem, ma’am. Take your time.” The simple gesture was such a nice reminder of the importance of being patient. Even in the busiest of moments, a little bit of kindness can go a long way.
