Due to their large size, mooring a dirigible on the Empire State Building was an incredibly difficult task which required a structure to accommodate them. To achieve this, the builders had to plan for the appropriate docking station, secure the necessary approval and navigate the controversies that went along with it.

The process of constructing a docking station for the dirigibles proved to be difficult. Almost immediately after the Empire State Building was completed, plans were drafted to construct a landing pad on the building’s top. The plans called for a 186- foot platform equipped with four large masts at set distances to anchor the airships. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted in The Mooring Mast, there was great controversy over the decision to build a landing pad on the building’s 102nd floor due to the immense cost and potential danger. Despite the controversy, the builders persevered and the landing pad was built between 1930- 1931. 

Moreover, the builders of the Empire State Building had to secure approval from the government and airship companies for the construction of the docking station. In order for an airship to moor on the station, the builders would need the approval of the Secretary of Commerce and the CAA (Civil Aeronautics Authority). They also needed the assurance from airship companies that the station would be capable of servicing their ships. The builders of the Empire State Building furiously worked to guarantee the safety and functionality of the mooring mast to ensure all the necessary approval could
