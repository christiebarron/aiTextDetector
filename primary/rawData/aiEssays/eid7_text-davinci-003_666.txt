I was walking through a crowded mall when I noticed an elderly couple trying to figure out which way to go. I could see they were clearly lost and confused, so I decided to offer my assistance. Although I wanted to rush away and make it to my meeting on time, I took a deep breath and patiently walked over to the couple. When I asked them if they needed help, the couple was hesitant. After a few moments, they eventually agreed, explaining that they were unfamiliar with the mall and needed help finding their car. Without a second thought, I offered to accompany them. 

We slowly walked around the mall, and the couple talked to me about their lives. Despite feeling flustered by their stories, I remained patient and kept up a pleasant conversation with the couple. When we eventually located the car, I made sure to double check that it was the right one and helped them carry their bags to it. 

The couple thanked me for my time and patience and I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing I had helped. On my way out, I looked back at them - happy and content - and I knew I had made the right decision by being patient.
