I had been dealing with a lot of stress recently and I was looking for a way to unwind and bring a little joy back into my life. One day, my friends invited me over for dinner and I decided to go. When I arrived, I was welcomed with a big hug from my friend who was standing in the doorway, giggling. I couldn't help but begin to laugh, too!

Once inside, my friend’s family was gathered around the kitchen table, engaged in a lively game of charades. As my friends and I joined in the fun, I found myself laughing harder than I had in a long time. The more I laughed, the more I tried to stifle it, which only caused more laughter to come out.

We were all having such a good time throughout the evening and it was so hard to leave when it was time to go. As we were walking out the door, I took a deep breath, wishing I could stay a little longer. Suddenly, an image of my friends and I playing charades flashed back into my head, making me laugh uncontrollably like I hadn’t done in months.

It felt so good to laugh with my friends that night, and I left feeling invigorated and full of life. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and it brought me such joy to experience it with my friends.
