I remember one day in high school when I was feeling particularly overwhelmed and had a lot of work to do in a short amount of time. My patience had been waning all week and I felt like I was about to snap.

I spent the morning writing an essay and struggling to get my thoughts down on the page. I was feeling discouraged and frustrated, but I kept plugging away at it. I reminded myself that I could do this, that I had worked through hard things before.

Eventually, my essay was finished. Even though I hadn't been feeling particularly patient at the beginning of the day, I was proud of myself for persisting and finishing my work. Despite the challenges I had faced, I had kept my cool and remained patient all the way through. 

This experience taught me that having patience in the face of difficulty can make all the difference. Even when the odds seem insurmountable, the right attitude can help you make it through.
