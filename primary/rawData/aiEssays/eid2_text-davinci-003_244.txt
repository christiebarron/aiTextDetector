Considering this, maybe the more important factor is providing adults with the tools to make their own informed decisions.

When considering materials that may be deemed offensive, adults should be informed of the potential dangers and implications of the material, instead of leaving them to blindly accept something that could have negative consequences. Therefore, one solution could be to place warning labels on materials which could be deemed as inappropriate. This would then provide adults with the information they need to make informed decisions, while still promoting their freedom of knowledge.
