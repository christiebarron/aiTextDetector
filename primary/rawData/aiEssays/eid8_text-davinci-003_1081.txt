I was out on a date with my girlfriend, and I could tell that the tension between us was rising. We had been arguing a lot lately, and I felt like everything was going wrong. Just when I was ready to call it a night, my girlfriend started laughing. I asked her what was so funny, and she said her laughter was just. so. contagious.

I tried to contain my laughter, but it was no use. We were both just laughing so hard, unable to stop. For the first time in forever, we were laughing together and it felt so good. That moment was our turning point in our relationship.

From that night onwards, we started to laugh together more often. Every time things got hard, we would make funny jokes or tell funny stories. Often it would make things more bearable. Laughter became our way of bonding and healing.

That moment of uncontrollable laughter made us realize how important it is to laugh together. It taught us that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and an essential part of any relationship.
