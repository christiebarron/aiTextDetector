Censorship has been an ongoing debate within the library community for some time. While libraries offer many different types of materials to their patrons, there must be limits of what can be included and what can’t. Allowing materials deemed offensive or inappropriate to remain on the shelves of public libraries sends a message that the library condones such things. 

Many people argue that public libraries should never remove any material from the shelves regardless of potential offensive content. They claim that censoring materials restricts First Amendment rights by limiting access to knowledge. What they fail to take into account is that access to certain types of knowledge should be limited when it risks exposing children and other vulnerable populations to dangerous ideas. 

Young children often visit the public library for books that may be inappropriate for their age. Many books contain dangerous ideas which can be potentially damaging to their overall wellbeing. It’s not right that libraries allow such materials to remain on the shelves when they pose a threat to the development of young people. 

The primary responsibility of a library is to protect the public, and they should do whatever they can to ensure that no one is exposed to any materials that are too explicit or frightening. Therefore, libraries should encourage their patrons to use their judgment when selecting material and draw the line when it comes to what is acceptable in the library. 

Libraries should act as gatekeepers for their communities and practice censorship in order to maintain a safe and welcoming environment. Censorship of materials that are deemed offensive is an essential part of ensuring the well-being of library patrons.
