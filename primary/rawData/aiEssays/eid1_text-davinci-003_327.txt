Dear Editor,

As technology continues to evolve, computers are becoming a common household item and are being used for almost any activity imaginable. While computers undoubtedly have their advantages, it is important to consider the long-term effects that their use can have on people.

One major concern is the potential for physical harm to people. Prolonged use of computers can lead to vision strain, neck and back pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, many people are developing poor eating habits because of their excessive screen time.

The psychological impact of computers should not be overlooked either. It can be easy to become addicted to online activities like online gaming, social media, and even surfing the web. This can lead to mental fatigue and an inability to focus the mind on other tasks, such as reading or speaking with other people. It can also be emotionally damaging, as people may become overly reliant on their online community, while simultaneously isolating themselves from the physical world they live in. 

Ultimately, computers can offer a variety of benefits, but it is important to recognize their potentially detrimental effects as well.Those who use computers should be aware of the risks and take steps to limit their exposure to the device.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
