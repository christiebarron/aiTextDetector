Dirigibles were seen as a promising form of air transport in the early 20th century, providing a luxurious and efficient form of travel for passengers and cargo. As airships became more popular, the need for a reliable way to dock them arose. The Empire State Building, which was constructed in New York City between 1931 and 1933, had the distinction of being the first building in the world to install a docking station for dirigibles, an impressive engineering feat.

As described in the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the building’s architect, William Lamb, was determined to create a docking mast that would be both structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing. This proved to be an immense challenge, as he was confronted with numerous obstacles in order to make his idea a reality. On a structural level, the mast would need to withstand the strong winds buffeting the Empire State Building, with its top nine hundred feet exposed to the elements. Its metal structure would need to handle the enormous weight of the dirigibles, which sometimes exceeded two hundred thousand pounds. Lamb also had to factor in the question of how to safely control the arriving airships and how to protect passengers and other bystanders who were on the ground.

In addition to these structural considerations, Lamb faced aesthetic obstacles as well. He had to design the mooring mast in a manner that complemented and accentuated the Art Deco style of the building’s facade and facade without detracting from it. He also had to make sure that airship passengers and pedestrians had a clear, unob
