I was running late for my bus to school today and was rushing to the bus stop when I suddenly heard the bus start to pull away. Knowing that I had only missed it by a few seconds, I couldn't help but feel frustrated and stressed. I then heard a voice beside me saying "It's okay, another one will come soon."

I looked over to see an elderly woman with a kind smile, who had seen me struggle to make it to the bus stop. Even though I was feeling rushed and discouraged, her words reminded me to stay patient and take a few calming breaths.

We stood there together and waited, chatting about our different days and letting the time pass by. Sure enough, another bus came and I had plenty of time to get on and to my destination.

I thanked the woman for her advice and kind words and was reminded to stay patient even in the most difficult of situations.
