I remember the day I first met my best friend like it was yesterday. We were in third grade and seated alphabetically in our classroom. I had just finished a particularly tricky math problem and I heard her laugh from the desk next to me. Intrigued, I glanced in her direction and caught her eyes. She looked away, blushing, and couldn't help but chuckle.

My initial instinct was to feel embarrassed and to quickly look away but something else overcame me. A silly urge to laugh alongside her. So I did and it felt marvelous! We both shared a laugh and soon after, we began talking.

I knew right away we were kindred spirits. We had a fun, easygoing relationship that was built around laughter and we never seemed to run out of jokes or funny stories. We would stay up late at night telling stories and playing pranks on our families, anything to get a good laugh. Even after all these years, our friendship is still based on laughter. It's a bond that's lasted through thick and thin and will surely last until the end of time.
