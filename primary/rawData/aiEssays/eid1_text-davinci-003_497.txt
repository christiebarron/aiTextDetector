Dear [Newspaper],

It’s no surprise that computers have changed our lives. They’ve become an indispensable part of our daily lives. But as technology advances, I’ve been pondering the effects of these electronic marvels on people.

When used wisely, computers can help us stay better connected with friends and family, save us time and money, and let us work smarter and faster. They can also open up unlimited educational possibilities, enabling us to explore and develop new skills. But there are also risks associated with computers.

Due to the countless distractions available on the internet, it’s easier than ever to spend hours on social networking sites, playing games, or researching our favorite topics. This can lead to decreased productivity and even distorted perceptions of reality. We may also be exposing ourselves to data breaches or viruses.

Overall, computers can be a great tool - as long as we take the necessary steps to protect ourselves, use them responsibly, and prioritize the activities that matter most. We should be aware of the potential risks, and strive to use computers to our advantage instead of becoming consumed with them.

Sincerely, 
[Name]
