Recently, the debate surrounding censorship in libraries has been reignited. As a taxpayer-funded institution, libraries should be held to the highest standards of morality and respectability. Controversial materials found to be distasteful, immoral, or otherwise objectionable should not be made available to the public through libraries.

When discussing the issue of censorship in libraries, it is important to consider the right of citizens to access materials of their choosing. However, the right for people to consume questionable materials should not come at the cost of public respectability. It is the responsibility of libraries to ensure the materials they provide are appropriate for all citizens. This includes those who may be minors or more sensitive to certain types of content. 

In addition, libraries should consider the message they send to patrons by stocking certain materials. Libraries are increasingly seen as a beacon of community values, so it is important that they do not inadvertently promote content that could be considered offensive by some. 

Censorship in libraries is not as simple as barring certain materials â€“ it is a matter of responsibility and selection. Libraries should be free to offer materials of all types, but should act with due diligence and consideration when choosing which materials to keep in stock. Books, music, movies, and magazines should be reviewed with an eye to respectability, and if they are found to be offensive, they should be removed from the shelves.
