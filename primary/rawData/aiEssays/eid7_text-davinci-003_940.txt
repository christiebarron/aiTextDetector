I was running late for work one morning, which was not a rare occurrence for me. I was almost at the office when I got stuck in an unexpected traffic jam. Other drivers began honking their horns, anxious to get moving, but I remained calm and patient. Finally, 30 minutes later, the traffic cleared and I made it to work.

When I arrived, my boss was waiting for me and I was certain I was in for an ear full. Instead, they noticed I kept my cool while stuck in traffic and thanked me for my patience. I was relieved to have avoided a scolding, and I'm glad my patience paid off.
