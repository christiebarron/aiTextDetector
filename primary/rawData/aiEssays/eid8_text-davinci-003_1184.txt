My best friend and I were having a girls night out. We had just finished dinner and were walking around the shops, joking about life and sharing stories about our week. After a while, we were laughing hysterically at some of the craziest misfortunes we both had faced. We were so caught up in our conversations that it didn't even matter anymore that we were in the middle of the mall; passers-by must have thought we were a couple of lunatics. We were laughing until our stomachs hurt, until the tears were streaming down our faces.

Our laughter had brought us so close together, like nothing else ever could. We both knew in that moment how much we meant to each other and how important our friendship was. We headed back to my place, still chuckling and talking about our night, still buzzing from the light that laughter had brought. Our night was one for the books; no trouble too big or small for us to conquer together. Laughter had brought us together and forever changed our friendship.
