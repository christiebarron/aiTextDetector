The ambitious effort to build the Empire State Building in 1931 brought the need to drastically revamp the architecture in the New York skyline, providing opportunities for amazing feats of engineering. One of the most ambitious efforts was to allow dirigibles to dock at the newly built tower.

The engineers and builders of the Empire State Building quickly learned that the technical and physical obstacles of mooring a large airship to a skyscraper were immense. The dirigible needed a special anchoring system that was designed to keep it stable, even when buffeted by strong winds. It also needed to extend from the top of the building, as the airship could not get close enough to the side unless it was at a perilous angle. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the Empire State Building would need to be modified to account for the added stress of being tethered.

The idea of mooring dirigibles at the Empire State Building met with trepidation from many of the engineers, as they worried that even with the best safety precautions, the risks involved in launching and docking a large airship were still too great. In fact, the difficulty in finding a suitable anchoring system presented some of the biggest roadblocks to this effort. To solve this problem, the engineers had to come up with a solution to retrofit the building with a specially designed, double anchoring system, which became known as "the mooring mast."

The design of the mooring mast was quite intricate, and it was extremely difficult to engineer and manufacture. The top of the mast consisted of two large reinforced steel plates, each of
