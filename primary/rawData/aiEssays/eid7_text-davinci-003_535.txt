I was waiting in line to board my flight at the airport and the line was incredibly long. Everyone seemed to be getting more and more impatient, with people making irritated comments and some visibly exasperated with the wait. I, however, decided to try my best to stay patient, understanding that airports are usually busy places and that this scenario isn't something people have a lot of control over.

I focused on taking deep breaths, smiling at the people in front of me, and thinking of something happy. Before I knew it, I was finally at the front of the line, feeling much less frazzled than the people I had been standing behind. I had managed to stay patient despite the irritation around me and it felt good to have kept my composure.
