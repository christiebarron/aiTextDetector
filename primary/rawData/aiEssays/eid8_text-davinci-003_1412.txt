I was out with an old friend of mine the other day, and out of the blue he dropped a cheesy joke I hadn't heard in years. Before he could even finish, I started laughing uncontrollably. It was exactly the kind of humor that I grew up on, and seeing him crack up alongside me took me back to a special place that had been tucked away for decades. It was like we were kids all over again, and the laughter felt like balm on the wounds of the past. As we continued laughing, it felt like a bridge was being built between us and a newfound sense of understanding suddenly blossomed. In that moment I realized how powerful laughter really can be, and how far even a single joke can take us.
