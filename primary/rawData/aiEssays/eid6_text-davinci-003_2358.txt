The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the most challenging was the necessity of a strong airship mooring mast that could handle the weight of the dirigibles. Such a tall structure had never been built before, and the builders had to design and create something that could withstand the strain put on it by a heavy airship and the wind. 

The mast, when completed, was the tallest structure ever built up to that point and stood at 390 feet. It was outfitted with enormous steel cables and clamps designed to secure the airships in place. In order to make sure the mast held up against the strong winds, the cables and clamps were designed to pull down on the airship and anchor it as it neared the top of the mast.

Another significant obstacle was the cost of the construction. Many people thought it was too expensive to build a mooring mast of that size, but the builders stuck with the project. Although it was expensive, the Empire State Building directors saw it as a crucial investment in New York Cityâ€™s future. 

A third major hurdle the builders had to overcome was the political opposition to their plans. There were doubters who thought the idea was too dangerous, citing potential accidents and fires if dirigibles were allowed to dock on the building. The directors were able to overcome the opponents by providing enough evidence proving the safety of the project and demonstrating that the public would be well served if the plans were approved.

In the end, the builders of the Empire State Building were successful
