Dear [Local Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have had on peopleâ€™s lives. As technology advances, we are becoming increasingly reliant on computers for everything from communication to entertainment.

On the one hand, computers can be incredibly helpful and timesaving for our daily tasks. We now have access to almost limitless information at our fingertips, and the ability to connect with people around the world. This technology can be a tremendous asset to us, especially in the workplace.

On the other hand, computers can also create serious hazards to our wellbeing. Spending too much time in front of a computer screen can lead to physical, mental, and emotional effects that are damaging to our health and relationships. Many young people now spend more time engaging with their computer or phone than with other humans, leading to social isolation. Additionally, we are all aware of the security threats posed by technology, including viruses and other malicious software.

I believe that, although technology can be an invaluable resource, it is important to remember that computers cannot take the place of physical interaction with other humans. We must strive to use technology in moderation, and prioritize our use of it in a way that does not negatively affect our lives and relationships.

Thank you for reading my opinion on this matter. I hope my words will help persuade your readers to also view computers with this balanced perspective.

Sincerely,
