It was my first date with Jake and I was nervous. We'd been texting back and forth for a few weeks, and I wanted this date to go well. We decided to meet at a sushi restaurant, and I arrived early so I could watch him enter from my seat at the bar.

When Jake entered, I immediately noticed his eyes twinkling with mischief. We exchanged an awkward “hello”, and then he said something so unexpected and so ridiculous that we couldn't help but burst out laughing.

I laughed until my stomach hurt, and I couldn't remember the last time I'd laughed so hard. When the laughter subsided, we settled into our dinner and conversation. I learned more about him than I had texting, and felt our awkwardness melt away. 

Laughter had been the healing balm our nerves needed; it seemed to have opened up a genuine connection between us. At the end of the night we hugged goodbye and I knew I was looking forward to our next date.
