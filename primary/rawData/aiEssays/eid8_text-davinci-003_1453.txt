I was out for dinner with my husband the other night, and I was feeling a bit overwhelmed. It had been a long day at work, and I was finding it difficult to be in that happy, bubbly mood that dinner conversations often require. 

My husband could immediately tell something was on my mind, and he tried to cheer me up. We had both been talking about how hectic our lives had been lately and how we wanted to just relax, so he jokingly suggested that we take a two-week vacation – somewhere tropical. 

At first I was surprised, but the joke made me laugh. Once I started giggling, I couldn't stop. And it wasn't just me – soon my husband was also in stitches. We both found our laughter infectious, and we started laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our cheeks. 

The laughter was cathartic. All the worry and stress of the day washed away, and instead, we had this moment of pure joy. Sitting in the restaurant, we just looked at each other and laughed and laughed until we could barely breathe. 

It was quite magical moment. We both felt lighter and suddenly all of the problems of the day didn't seem so important. In the end, we didn't go on that two-week vacation, but I think the laughter we shared was even more special.
