The construction of the Empire State Building presented some difficult challenges, especially when it came to enabling docking by dirigibles. Dirigibles, or airships, were a popular mode of transportation in the 1920s and 1930s, and the builders of the Empire State Building knew they would have to undertake some unique arrangements to make sure the airships could dock at the tower.

One of the most significant obstacles in allowing docking by dirigibles was the lack of a specialized mooring mast, or equivalent, at the Empire State Building. The tower and its spire were designed to a great degree without considering the constraints of the dirigibles; therefore, a substantial addition to the structure was necessary. The builders of the Empire State Building settled on a tall, slim mast to replace the spire and to give the airships a secure spot to dock.

The tall, slim mooring mast also presented a challenge to the builders. The mast had to be constructed with extreme precision in order to properly hold the immense weight of the docked dirigible. Engineering was a major factor in the mastâ€™s construction and it took ingenuity to design the steel framework and metal lattice work to endure the stress of the airships. Installation was a painstaking process and the mast was tested and fortified several times until it was deemed capable of supporting thousands of pounds of airship material.

In addition to the engineering challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building also faced delays and resistance from the local government and nearby neighbors. It was determined that the mooring mast posed a security risk to the surrounding area, and
