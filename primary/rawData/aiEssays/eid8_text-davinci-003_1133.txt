I was out shopping with my friend one day when we came across a funny little trinket. It was a plastic figurine of a cow, wearing a lovely purple dress with a speech bubble next to it that said, 'Moo-ve over'. Instantly, my friend and I started laughing uncontrollably and we just couldn't seem to stop. 

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a little old lady standing next to us, looking rather bewildered. With a big grin on her face, she asked us what was so funny. We told her about the cow figurine and she started laughing along with us. The more we talked about it and laughed, the more her laughter grew louder, until finally, all three of us were almost crying with laughter. 

It felt so good to just let loose and share the joy with this complete stranger. We all laughed for a good few minutes and, when we were finally done, the little old lady gave us a knowing smile and a pat on the arm before she walked away. 

That moment of contagious laughter with my friend and the little old lady will always stay with me â€“ it really goes to show that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
