 

I was out with my best friend Mary for dinner and drinks the other night and things had gotten a bit awkward. We were catching up and talking about our plans for the future, but neither of us really seemed to know what to say next. Then, out of nowhere, Mary started telling this really funny story about a crazy dream she had the other night. We both started laughing so hard that we were crying and pretty soon it felt like the entire restaurant was laughing along with us. 

It was such a relief to just let go and laugh together like that - I don't think either of us had laughed so hard in a long time. After dinner, as we were walking back to our cars, we were both still laughing and telling each other jokes. Suddenly, everything seemed lighter and happier, and I was really grateful for the laughter that we shared. It made me realize how important it is to take breaks and just enjoy the moment with people that are important to me.
