I remember a time where I had to practice patience and understanding. Our office was severely understaffed and demands were high. Everyone was feeling overwhelmed and were working around the clock to try and stay on top of our workload. I felt incredibly frustrated and was starting to succumb to the stress.

I remember walking into the break room one day to find a co-worker crying over her desk. She had been working on a high priority project for days and was facing a tight deadline. Everyone else in the office was too busy to help her out. Seeing this, I decided that I would do my best to help her out. I approached her and asked her if there was anything I could do to help her complete the project.
 
She was so relieved to have some help. We worked together on the project until the late hours of the night. Eventually, we managed to finish the project on time. While it was a long and exhausting night, I was glad to have helped her out.

This experience taught me the value of patience. I was able to take a step back and help her out even though I was facing immense pressure myself. Through this experience, I have come to learn that patience is often the best way to work through difficult situations.
