One of my fondest memories of high school was the laughter we shared during lunchtime. I could always go to the cafeteria and find my friends laughing and having fun. I remember one specific joke that always made us all laugh, no matter how many times we heard it. It was about two friends who were walking around town, when one of them noticed a new store with a sign advertising "Free Money". His friend said, "You sure are lucky, you should definitely go in and get some of that free money." The other replied, "No way! If there was really free money in there, don't you think everyone would be in there taking it?" 

That was always a cue for all of us to get roaring with laughter, and when someone else would inevitably start telling the joke again, we'd all be ready with the punchline. I'm sure the cafeteria staff were getting annoyed with us, but I also know they enjoyed seeing us having so much fun together. We even got creative and started joking around with the food we had, like pretending to be surprised that the mashed potatoes were "fresh!" 

Laughter was always an important part of the dynamic of our friendship group, and I'm glad I can look back on that time and still smile. I really miss those days and the simple joy we found in a silly joke.
