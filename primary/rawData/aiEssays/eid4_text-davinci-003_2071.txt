The ending of Minfong Ho’s ‘Winter Hibiscus’ provides a powerful metaphor for recovering from adversity. Throughout the poem, the speaker reflects on their experience of failing a test at school, and how the struggle to overcome it parallels the growth of a winter hibiscus. Finishing off with the promise that the protagonist will take the test again in their next bout of ‘spring’ symbolizes the idea that life continues in cycles, and that progress should follow inevitable setbacks. 

The poem alludes to the idea of hope and resilience in the face of failure. Despite the fact that it has snowed outside and the geese have left, the protagonist holds faith that the winter hibiscus will one day flourish in spring. In the same way, when faced with an insurmountable challenge, the speaker looks forward to the promise of a better future. Hope and determination are demonstrated in their unwavering commitment to retake the test and prove themselves.

The winter hibiscus serves as an inspiring symbol of growth and renewal. After the frozen winter, the hibiscus blooms back to life, and in doing so, shows the narrator that they too can come back from challenging situations. The speaker’s promise to retake the test is a display of courage and self-belief- and a reminder that, with perseverance, even the most daunting and tough moments can be overcome. 

Overall, ‘Winter Hibiscus’ is a beautiful reminder that, despite life’s hardships, there is always an opportunity for growth
