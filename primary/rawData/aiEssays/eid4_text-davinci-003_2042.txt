The ending of Minfong Ho's poem, 'Winter Hibiscus', paints a vivid picture of a hibiscus getting ready for the new season. In the last stanza, it is clear that the speaker has a great connection with the plant, which is symbolic of them both trying to take a test that they had previously failed. They both hope for a better outcome when spring comes around, and that hope is strongly represented in the poem. 

The poet captures the subtle beauty of winter, and how the hibiscus, a symbol of life, can still find hope in the dead of winter. In spite of the cold, the harsher elements of winter, the plant is still finding a way to persevere through the cold months, despite not being able to produce any blossom. This captures the idea that anyone can find hope even in the bleakest moments or circumstances. 

The imagery of the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, further emphasize this idea of hope. It is a promise of the brighter days to come, a time of renewal, and a time to take the test again and find success. The poem manages to capture a moment of contemplation and reassurance, leaving us with an uplifting ending that implies that with enough hope, anything is possible. It is a potent reminder that even in the depths of winter, one can still find the courage and strength to pick themselves up and try again.
