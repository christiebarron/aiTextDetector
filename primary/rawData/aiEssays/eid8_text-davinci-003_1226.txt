It was my best friend's birthday and we decided to go out for dinner and drinks. We had been close for years, through thick and thin, and so treasured these days when we could spend time catching up with each other and laughing together. We arrived at the restaurant and were seated with smiles on our faces.

We shared stories about our lives, reminiscing about old memories and having a good laugh about all the crazy things that had happened in our lives. We were so caught up in conversation that we almost forgot to order what we had come for. 

Eventually, I remembered our mission and ordered a bottle of wine. We clinked glasses and toasted to friendship. However, it wasn't until the waiter brought out our mains that we experienced the peak of laughter. The waiter had accidentally given us the wrong dishes, which had us both in hysterics. The look of shock on our faces and the laughter that ensued had us in stitches and the rest of the restaurant taking notice.

We finished our food with a much-needed appreciation for the ridiculousness of the situation, along with a renewed enthusiasm for the friendship we shared. Laughter had been the curing balm that evening, allowing us to connect, bond, and appreciate each other all the more.
