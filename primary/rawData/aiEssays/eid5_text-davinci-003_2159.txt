The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives from Narciso Rodriguez evokes a feeling of nostalgia and reflection with vivid descriptions of his childhood homes and the people who shaped his life. Rodriguez reflects on his memories and experiences of growing up in various homes: an apartment in New Jersey, his grandmother's home in Puerto Rico and his father's home in Miami. He paints a picture of a vibrant, diverse family and community who encompass love and comfort.

The mood of the memoir moves between joy and heartache as he remembers his family and friends who are both present and absent. He makes mention of moments that bring joy, memories of celebrations such as "Christmas and Three Kings Day" and the sound of his family's laughter that fill his mind and bring a deep sense of comfort. He also reflects upon moments of sorrow, hearing loved ones laugh in his imagination yet knowing they are no longer there. 

Though Rodriguez takes readers through the various homes of his past and present, one canâ€™t help but feel a sense of belonging. He lovingly dives into the smells, sights and sounds that are his memories and invites the reader along to experience a part of his life. He connects thread pieces of his life to a larger story not only of himself, but also of his community and people. Rodriguez conveys a feeling of comfort and familiarity that resonates long after the memoir has been read.  Through From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Rodriguez creates a mood of nostalgia and contemplation, a tapestry of life that is all at once beautiful, heartbreaking and comforting.
