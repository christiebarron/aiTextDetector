Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

In the 21st century, we have become so reliant on technology that computers have infiltrated almost every aspect of our lives. We use them to communicate, learn and even shop. But as helpful as computers are, I believe that they can have negative effects on people.

It's no secret that technology has disconnected us from each other. Instead of having face-to-face conversations, communicating online has become the norm. Furthermore, the use of technology can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and even addiction.

On top of this, computers can be misused, leading to cyberbullying or identity theft. Usage of computers and the internet can also expose people to inappropriate content.

I want to urge readers to use computers responsibly and be mindful of the potential dangers. Partaking in activities such as reading a book or playing outside can be more beneficial than constantly using a computer. It is important to take regular breaks from computers in order to guard ourselves from the potential harms the use of technology has the potential to cause.

I hope readers take my opinion into consideration and take a mindful stance when utilizing computers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
