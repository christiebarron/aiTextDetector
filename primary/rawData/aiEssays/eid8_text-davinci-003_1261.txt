It was one of those days, where it felt like the world was against me. I had had an argument with my mom about my future plans, and my friends and I had gone through a rough patch over the weekend, so it wasn't exactly a high note. 

So when I arrived at school, my mood was pretty dismal. But I was determined to get through the day and put it behind me. 

Just then, I heard my best friend calling out my name from across the hall. I turned to look, and she had a silly grin on her face. She was holding something in her hands behind her back. 

"What is it?" I asked, not expecting any sort of good news. 

She pulled out a pineapple, and announced, "I got this for you, to cheer you up!" I couldn't help but burst out laughing. It was something so random that it was undeniably funny. 

That moment was the break I so badly needed. The laughter felt like a cleansing, like all of my worries and troubles just melted away. We both laughed for minutes and suddenly I felt my day get lighter. My best friend had a way of always doing that for me - making me laugh at the silliest things, no matter the situation.

In a matter of seconds, my day changed from bad to good, thanks to the laughter that my best friend had brought to the table.
