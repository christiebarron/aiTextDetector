Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade local readers to agree with me. As our technology advances, computers have become increasingly prominent and intertwined within our daily lives, affecting our relationships, health, and economy in many ways.

For one thing, technology has isolated us from others and made it harder to develop and maintain meaningful relationships. Although the internet allows us access to thousands of people and conversations, the virtual connection can never replace the conversations and human bond of face-to-face relationships.

Computer use also affects our physical health. Comfortably sitting in front of a computer for hours, or hunched over a laptop for days on end, can have adverse effects on our posture, eyesight, and prone to arm/neck pain or headaches.

Finally, the advancement of computer technology has also had a major effect on our job market and economy. Automation has made many jobs redundant and displaced millions of people into a permanently unemployed state, while those in positions with technical skills may be the only ones able to benefit.

In conclusion, while computers can provide us with immense access to knowledge and abilities, it is important that we use this technology with caution. We must remember to get up and away from our screens to better our physical and mental health, and help ensure good and meaningful relationships with our loved ones and communities. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
