I remember it like it was yesterday. It was the middle of winter and my best friend and I had decided to take a spontaneous road trip to the beach. We both had always loved the freedom that spontaneous trips gave us, and so, that is exactly what we did.

We decided to take a scenic route and ended up at a local diner for lunch. We had just sat down when we heard the most terrible, loud laughter coming from the next table. We both looked at each other, not sure if we should run or join in.

We decided to stay and before long, we were both laughing along with everyone else. We laughed until our faces hurt and our sides ached. We laughed until tears were running down our faces and we simply could not stop.

After that trip, and that truly magical moment at the diner, I knew that laughter was one of the best things in life. Not just in a silly, fun way, but in a way that bonds people and brings a spark of joy into the world.

I still talk to my friend every once in a while and whenever we do, we always remember that day at the diner, even though it was years ago. I often find myself laughing with her over the phone or over video call, remembering all the silly things we did that day.

Laughter for me will always be an essential part of my relationships with those close to me, because sometimes a shared laugh is all we need to feel a bond.
