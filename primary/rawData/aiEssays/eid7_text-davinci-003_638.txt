There was recently a moment when I was challenged to be patient, but instead rose to the challenge. I was at a grocery store, and the line I had gotten into ended up being incredibly slow. The cashier was new and seemed to be struggling with each step of the process.

I could feel the frustration of some of the other customers in the line, and I definitely wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. However, I was determined to remain patient and understanding.

In order to put myself in the position of others, I tried to think of the cashier’s situation from a different perspective. I imagined that I was in her shoes and it was my first time working the register. Then it suddenly became easier to see why she might need help and why things were taking so long.

I tried to be as friendly to the cashier as I could. I thanked her for her hard work and for taking the time to help out. That seemed to bring her some relief and her job became easier.

In the end, I was able to stay patient and I’m proud of myself for my efforts. It was a good reminder that a little kindness and understanding can go a long way.
