As a concerned citizen, I strongly believe that censorship in libraries should not be accepted. Libraries are a place of free thought and free speech, and removing certain materials from their shelves based on the opinion of only a few does not reflect these values.

Books, music, movies, and magazines should absolutely not be removed from the shelves because certain people find them offensive. Such censorship would lead to a slippery slope of remove and reject, without any understanding of the full context of the works in questions. Without adequate context, censorship becomes completely subjective and eliminates the possibility of meaningful dialogue and discovery. The role of libraries is to provide access to a wide variety of materials, and it is important to allow patrons to explore and judge the works themselves. 

In addition to this, libraries are symbols of democracy, as they ensure all individuals receive access to the same right to read, learn, and grow without censorship. Allowing certain materials to be removed based on personal opinion would contravene the democratic values libraries represent.

Material that contains obscene content should not be shelved in public libraries due to minors having access to them. However, these materials can be available for adults in a separate section, available through request. This will still give adults access to such material, while also protecting minor from from exposure.

Ultimately, censorship in libraries should not be accepted. By denying patrons access to certain materials, it will create a more limited library, inhibit dialogue and understanding, and ultimately, go against the democracy that libraries are built upon.
