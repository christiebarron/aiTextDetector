I was out with some friends at a local park when we decided to play a game of kickball. We were all having a great time and laughing and joking around. However, as soon as I kicked the ball, it flew into the lake. Everyone on the team burst into laughter. I knew I was going to be the butt of their jokes for the remainder of the day.

So, I had the brilliant idea to dive in and get the ball back. Everyone was screaming in laughter when I ran full speed into the lake and came up with the ball in hand. We continued our game with me covered in lake water, but I couldn't help but smile as I heard everyone's laughter. 

That was an experience I will never forget! We continue to laugh about it every time that we get together, and I'll never take life too seriously ever again.
