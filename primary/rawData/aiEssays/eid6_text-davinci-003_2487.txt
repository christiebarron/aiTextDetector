In 1930, the Empire State Building opened its doors as the world’s tallest building, standing 1,250 feet in midtown Manhattan. Despite not having an existing blueprint for its existing height, the builders of the Empire State Building made several forward-thinking decisions, including the installation of a 200-foot mooring mast that would allow dirigibles, which were the precursor to today’s blimps, to dock. But due to numerous obstacles that the builders faced, this cutting-edge technological feat was never a reality. 

One obstacle was the mooring system employed. As described in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders sought to use a“Blimpter” system that would allow a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. This system employed steel cables secured along the sides of the mast that would support a dirigible’s downward weight and also assist in controlling its lateral motion. It would also use a steel fiber gate that was comprised of a metal box containing metal runners. As the dirigible descended, a metal loop on its front end would catch on the runners, allowing it make a secure landing. 

These obstacles, however, soon became insurmountable. The design of the gate was fraught with technical difficulty as the weight of the gate was difficult to calculate, and the steel boxes became known for freezing workers during installation, posing a significant health and safety risk. In addition, the wind currents around the Empire State Building were too strong for the system, as the dirigibles could not maintain a secure position
