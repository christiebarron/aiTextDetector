To the Editor,

As computers become a more commonplace feature in our daily lives, it's natural to consider their effects on our wellbeing. Through my experience and research, I firmly believe that computers offer more positive effects than negative ones. 

For starters, computers have enabled more efficient communication and work processes. With the broad reach of the internet, we have unprecedented access to resources that can be used to enrich our lives. The advancement of technology has enabled us to save time on mundane tasks and better manage our time. For example, many people use the internet to learn new skills that they may not be able to develop elsewhere. 

Moreover, computers have enabled us to form meaningful connections with others and build relationships that might have just been a distant dream in the past. In a world where we rely so much on digital communication, having access to computers opens up many new opportunities to share experiences with people from different countries and cultures. 

It's true that computers can be detrimental if used for long periods of time or in negative ways. Despite this, the advantages provided by computers greatly outweigh the risks. To enjoy the benefits of computers safely, individuals should aim to take regular breaks from their device or find ways to balance their digital life and their physical one. 

Overall, computers are powerful tools that bring enormous potential for positive effects into our lives. I urge readers to be conscious of the impact computers can have on our mental and physical wellbeing and make sure
