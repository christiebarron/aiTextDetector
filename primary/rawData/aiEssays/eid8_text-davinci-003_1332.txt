I was out to dinner with my friend, Sue, and we were discussing our plans to move in together. We had been close friends for many years and now our plans were finally coming to fruition. We were both excited and nervous, unsure of what lay ahead. 

Suddenly, Sue bit into a piece of garlic bread and made a face. "Oh my god, that's soooo gross!" she cried out. We both started laughing at the same time, her laughter contagious and contagious. 

Then the waiter suddenly appeared at our table and asked, "Do you girls need anything else?" 

Still roaring with laughter, Sue quipped, "A hazard suit would be niceâ€¦ to protect me from my dinner!" 

We both lost it, cackling with delight as the rest of the restaurant witnessed our silly exchange.

That evening marked a turning point for us. In that moment I knew that no matter what the future held for us, laughter would always bring us closer.
