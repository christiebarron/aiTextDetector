I had never been particularly close to my grandfather. Even though I would visit him every weekend since I was a little girl, I never felt like we connected. It wasn't until one dry summer day at the nursing home that changed things.

My grandfather and I were sitting alone in his room, talking aimlessly about the weather. I had nothing else to talk about, so I started to laugh. A little laugh at first, but then it built until it sounded like a loud cackle. Soon my grandfather was laughing too, and then the both of us were doubled over with laughter until tears were streaming down our cheeks. 

I was overwhelmed by the realization that I had finally made a connection with my grandfather through something as simple as laughter. From that day forward, my grandfather and I would regularly laugh together, connecting us like nothing else.
