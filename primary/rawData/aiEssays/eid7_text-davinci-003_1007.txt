 

My mother is the most patient person I know. I'll never forget the time I made a huge mess in the kitchen when I was younger. I was trying to bake a cake but I poured the entire bag of flour onto the counter. The scene was disastrous. I was about to lose it, but before I could, my mom stepped in. She gave me a gentle pat on the arm and said, "Don't worry, it's not a big deal. Let's just take a few minutes to clean it up."

I was amazed at her calm reaction. I started to help her clean up and after a few minutes, the floor was back to normal. Then, she said, "Why don't we watch some TV while the cake bakes?" From that moment on, I realized the importance of being patient. Even when the situation seemed hopeless, my mom remained composed and showed me that patience was the best way to respond.
