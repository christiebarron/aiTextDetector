Dear [Editor],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is often assumed that computers have had a mostly negative impact on our lives, yet I believe that these advances in technology have made life easier and more efficient for all of us in many different ways.

For starters, computers have opened up a world of online communication and connectivity. We can now collaborate with people all over the world, share ideas, and get information quickly. This has facilitated an increased level of creativity and innovation within the global community, and in turn has increased the speed of progress.

In addition, computers have enabled us to automate mundane tasks and carry out complex tasks such as analyzing data in a fraction of the time that it would take a human to do it. This has saved time and money in both our professional and personal lives, as well as allowed us to get more done in a shorter amount of time.

Finally, computers have provided us with an unprecedented level of entertainment. We can now watch our favorite shows, read the latest books, and play the most recent video games right from the comfort of our homes. This has allowed us to fulfill our needs for distraction and relaxation in a much more convenient manner.

Overall, I feel that computers have had a positive impact on our lives, and I hope that I have been able to persuade you to agree with me.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
