Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a powerful and moving work, full of emotion and vivid imagery. Through his words, Rodriguez captures the energy of the Latinx culture, from its bright colours to its passionate rhythms.

The narrative creates a mood of nostalgia, joy, and longing. Rodriguez takes readers to his beloved childhood home of Jersey City and lays out his family’s history. He describes the vibrant and exuberant atmosphere of his old neighborhood, gathering in the streets during holidays or going to the carnivals. These memories trigger a sense of yearning, as even when his life took him far away, it never left his heart.

At the same time, Rodriguez’s remembrances are tinged with a melancholic realism. He conveys the harshness of his neighbourhood, his sister and father’s addiction problems, and the painful loss of his beloved mother. This highlights the struggles the Latinx community faced at the time, and reveals the strength and resilience of his characters—people who rose above their difficult circumstances and embraced life with passion.

The memoir also radiates with Rodriguez’s own joy and pride, from his father’s triumphant return from prison to his own successful career. Filled with love, hope, and human resilience, the story communicates the beauty and spirit of the Latinx community—a culture filled with rich and wonderful traditions that have the power to transcend time and place.
