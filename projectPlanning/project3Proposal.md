# Project 3 Proposal

We propose creating a full-stack data visualization web application using a combination of: Python Flask-power API, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and SQL.

This project will include three different dashboard pages. The first two involve a server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization. The final is a dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data.

1. Text-input AI text detection: A text-input dashboard in which anyone can input written text and our app will provide a dashboard depicting the likelihood it was AI-generated.

    - User-driven interaction: textbox with an event listener.

2. Text-input Writing scoring: a text-input dashboard coinciding with a report card. Anyone can input human-written text and our app will provide a dashboard and feedback on the quality of the writing. 

    - User-driven interaction: textbox with an event listener.

3. Teacher Dashboard: a teacher dashboard depicting the writing characteristics of 100 different students whose writing has already been analyzed. These interactive graphs will mirror our work in project 1. 

    - User-driven interaction: drop down selecting different a) students and b) features.
